1	0||Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) regulate a variety of fundamental cellular processes. CDK10 stands out as one of the last orphan CDKs for which no activating cyclin has been identified and no kinase activity revealed. Previous work has shown that CDK10 silencing increases ETS2 (v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog 2)-driven activation of the MAPK pathway	 which confers tamoxifen resistance to breast cancer cells. The precise mechanisms by which CDK10 modulates ETS2 activity	 and more generally the functions of CDK10	 remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that CDK10 is a cyclin-dependent kinase by identifying cyclin M as an activating cyclin. Cyclin M	 an orphan cyclin	 is the product of FAM58A	 whose mutations cause STAR syndrome	 a human developmental anomaly whose features include toe syndactyly	 telecanthus	 and anogenital and renal malformations. We show that STAR syndrome-associated cyclin M mutants are unable to interact with CDK10. Cyclin M silencing phenocopies CDK10 silencing in increasing c-Raf and in conferring tamoxifen resistance to breast cancer cells. CDK10/cyclin M phosphorylates ETS2 in vitro	 and in cells it positively controls ETS2 degradation by the proteasome. ETS2 protein levels are increased in cells derived from a STAR patient	 and this increase is attributable to decreased cyclin M levels. Altogether	 our results reveal an additional regulatory mechanism for ETS2	 which plays key roles in cancer and development. They also shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying STAR syndrome.Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) play a pivotal role in the control of a number of fundamental cellular processes (1). The human genome contains 21 genes encoding proteins that can be considered as members of the CDK family owing to their sequence similarity with bona fide CDKs	 those known to be activated by cyclins (2). Although discovered almost 20 y ago (3	 4)	 CDK10 remains one of the two CDKs without an identified cyclin partner. This knowledge gap has largely impeded the exploration of its biological functions. CDK10 can act as a positive cell cycle regulator in some cells (5	 6) or as a tumor suppressor in others (7	 8). CDK10 interacts with the ETS2 (v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog 2) transcription factor and inhibits its transcriptional activity through an unknown mechanism (9). CDK10 knockdown derepresses ETS2	 which increases the expression of the c-Raf protein kinase	 activates the MAPK pathway	 and induces resistance of MCF7 cells to tamoxifen (6).Here	 we deorphanize CDK10 by identifying cyclin M	 the product of FAM58A	 as a binding partner. Mutations in this gene that predict absence or truncation of cyclin M are associated with STAR syndrome	 whose features include toe syndactyly	 telecanthus	 and anogenital and renal malformations in heterozygous females (10). However	 both the functions of cyclin M and the pathogenesis of STAR syndrome remain unknown. We show that a recombinant CDK10/cyclin M heterodimer is an active protein kinase that phosphorylates ETS2 in vitro. Cyclin M silencing phenocopies CDK10 silencing in increasing c-Raf and phospho-ERK expression levels and in inducing tamoxifen resistance in estrogen receptor (ER)+ breast cancer cells. We show that CDK10/cyclin M positively controls ETS2 degradation by the proteasome	 through the phosphorylation of two neighboring serines. Finally	 we detect an increased ETS2 expression level in cells derived from a STAR patient	 and we demonstrate that it is attributable to the decreased cyclin M expression level observed in these cells.Previous SectionNext SectionResultsA yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen unveiled an interaction signal between CDK10 and a mouse protein whose C-terminal half presents a strong sequence homology with the human FAM58A gene product [whose proposed name is cyclin M (11)]. We thus performed Y2H mating assays to determine whether human CDK10 interacts with human cyclin M (Fig. 1 Aâ€“C). The longest CDK10 isoform (P1) expressed as a bait protein produced a strong interaction phenotype with full-length cyclin M (expressed as a prey protein) but no detectable phenotype with cyclin D1	 p21 (CIP1)	 and Cdi1 (KAP)	 which are known binding partners of other CDKs (Fig. 1B). CDK1 and CDK3 also produced Y2H signals with cyclin M	 albeit notably weaker than that observed with CDK10 (Fig. 1B). An interaction phenotype was also observed between full-length cyclin M and CDK10 proteins expressed as bait and prey	 respectively (Fig. S1A). We then tested different isoforms of CDK10 and cyclin M originating from alternative gene splicing	 and two truncated cyclin M proteins corresponding to the hypothetical products of two mutated FAM58A genes found in STAR syndrome patients (10). None of these shorter isoforms produced interaction phenotypes (Fig. 1 A and C and Fig. S1A).Fig. 1.In a new window Download PPTFig. 1.CDK10 and cyclin M form an interaction complex. (A) Schematic representation of the different protein isoforms analyzed by Y2H assays. Amino acid numbers are indicated. Black boxes indicate internal deletions. The red box indicates a differing amino acid sequence compared with CDK10 P1. (B) Y2H assay between a set of CDK proteins expressed as baits (in fusion to the LexA DNA binding domain) and CDK interacting proteins expressed as preys (in fusion to the B42 transcriptional activator). pEG202 and pJG4-5 are the empty bait and prey plasmids expressing LexA and B42	 respectively. lacZ was used as a reporter gene	 and blue yeast are indicative of a Y2H interaction phenotype. (C) Y2H assay between the different CDK10 and cyclin M isoforms. The amino-terminal region of ETS2	 known to interact with CDK10 (9)	 was also assayed. (D) Western blot analysis of Myc-CDK10 (wt or kd) and CycM-V5-6His expression levels in transfected HEK293 cells. (E) Western blot analysis of Myc-CDK10 (wt or kd) immunoprecipitates obtained using the anti-Myc antibody. â€œInputsâ€ correspond to 10 Î¼g total lysates obtained from HEK293 cells coexpressing Myc-CDK10 (wt or kd) and CycM-V5-6His. (F) Western blot analysis of immunoprecipitates obtained using the anti-CDK10 antibody or a control goat antibody	 from human breast cancer MCF7 cells. â€œInputâ€ corresponds to 30 Î¼g MCF7 total cell lysates. The lower band of the doublet observed on the upper panel comigrates with the exogenously expressed untagged CDK10 and thus corresponds to endogenous CDK10. The upper band of the doublet corresponds to a nonspecific signal	 as demonstrated by it insensitivity to either overexpression of CDK10 (as seen on the left lane) or silencing of CDK10 (Fig. S2B). Another experiment with a longer gel migration is shown in Fig. S1D.Next we examined the ability of CDK10 and cyclin M to interact when expressed in human cells (Fig. 1 D and E). We tested wild-type CDK10 (wt) and a kinase dead (kd) mutant bearing a D181A amino acid substitution that abolishes ATP binding (12). We expressed cyclin M-V5-6His and/or Myc-CDK10 (wt or kd) in a human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293). The expression level of cyclin M-V5-6His was significantly increased upon coexpression with Myc-CDK10 (wt or kd) and	 to a lesser extent	 that of Myc-CDK10 (wt or kd) was increased upon coexpression with cyclin M-V5-6His (Fig. 1D). We then immunoprecipitated Myc-CDK10 proteins and detected the presence of cyclin M in the CDK10 (wt) and (kd) immunoprecipitates only when these proteins were coexpressed pair-wise (Fig. 1E). We confirmed these observations by detecting the presence of Myc-CDK10 in cyclin M-V5-6His immunoprecipitates (Fig. S1B). These experiments confirmed the lack of robust interaction between the CDK10.P2 isoform and cyclin M (Fig. S1C). To detect the interaction between endogenous proteins	 we performed immunoprecipitations on nontransfected MCF7 cells derived from a human breast cancer. CDK10 and cyclin M antibodies detected their cognate endogenous proteins by Western blotting. We readily detected cyclin M in immunoprecipitates obtained with the CDK10 antibody but not with a control antibody (Fig. 1F). These results confirm the physical interaction between CDK10 and cyclin M in human cells.To unveil a hypothesized CDK10/cyclin M protein kinase activity	 we produced GST-CDK10 and StrepII-cyclin M fusion proteins in insect cells	 either individually or in combination. We observed that GST-CDK10 and StrepII-cyclin M copurified	 thus confirming their interaction in yet another cellular model (Fig. 2A). We then performed in vitro kinase assays with purified proteins	 using histone H1 as a generic substrate. Histone H1 phosphorylation was detected only from lysates of cells coexpressing GST-CDK10 and StrepII-cyclin M. No phosphorylation was detected when GST-CDK10 or StrepII-cyclin M were expressed alone	 or when StrepII-cyclin M was coexpressed with GST-CDK10(kd) (Fig. 2A). Next we investigated whether ETS2	 which is known to interact with CDK10 (9) (Fig. 1C)	 is a phosphorylation substrate of CDK10/cyclin M. We detected strong phosphorylation of ETS2 by the GST-CDK10/StrepII-cyclin M purified heterodimer	 whereas no phosphorylation was detected using GST-CDK10 alone or GST-CDK10(kd)/StrepII-cyclin M heterodimer (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2.In a new window Download PPTFig. 2.CDK10 is a cyclin M-dependent protein kinase. (A) In vitro protein kinase assay on histone H1. Lysates from insect cells expressing different proteins were purified on a glutathione Sepharose matrix to capture GST-CDK10(wt or kd) fusion proteins alone	 or in complex with STR-CycM fusion protein. Purified protein expression levels were analyzed by Western blots (Top and Upper Middle). The kinase activity was determined by autoradiography of histone H1	 whose added amounts were visualized by Coomassie staining (Lower Middle and Bottom). (B) Same as in A	 using purified recombinant 6His-ETS2 as a substrate.CDK10 silencing has been shown to increase ETS2-driven c-RAF transcription and to activate the MAPK pathway (6). We investigated whether cyclin M is also involved in this regulatory pathway. To aim at a highly specific silencing	 we used siRNA pools (mix of four different siRNAs) at low final concentration (10 nM). Both CDK10 and cyclin M siRNA pools silenced the expression of their cognate targets (Fig. 3 A and C and Fig. S2) and	 interestingly	 the cyclin M siRNA pool also caused a marked decrease in CDK10 protein level (Fig. 3A and Fig. S2B). These results	 and those shown in Fig. 1D	 suggest that cyclin M binding stabilizes CDK10. Cyclin M silencing induced an increase in c-Raf protein and mRNA levels (Fig. 3 B and C) and in phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2 protein levels (Fig. S3B)	 similarly to CDK10 silencing. As expected from these effects (6)	 CDK10 and cyclin M silencing both decreased the sensitivity of ER+ MCF7 cells to tamoxifen	 to a similar extent. The combined silencing of both genes did not result in a higher resistance to the drug (Fig. S3C). Altogether	 these observations demonstrate a functional interaction between cyclin M and CDK10	 which negatively controls ETS2.Fig. 3.In a new window Download PPTFig. 3.Cyclin M silencing up-regulates c-Raf expression.

ETS2 is a short-lived protein degraded by the proteasome (13). A straightforward hypothesis is that CDK10/cyclin M positively controls ETS2 degradation. We thus examined the impact of CDK10 or cyclin M silencing on ETS2 expression levels. The silencing of CDK10 and that of cyclin M caused an increase in the expression levels of an exogenously expressed Flag-ETS2 protein (Fig. S4A)	 as well as of the endogenous ETS2 protein (Fig. 4A). This increase is not attributable to increased ETS2 mRNA levels	 which marginally fluctuated in response to CDK10 or cyclin M silencing (Fig. S4B). We then examined the expression levels of the Flag-tagged ETS2 protein when expressed alone or in combination with Myc-CDK10 or -CDK10(kd)	 with or without cyclin M-V5-6His. Flag-ETS2 was readily detected when expressed alone or	 to a lesser extent	 when coexpressed with CDK10(kd). However	 its expression level was dramatically decreased when coexpressed with CDK10 alone	 or with CDK10 and cyclin M (Fig. 4B). These observations suggest that endogenous cyclin M levels are in excess compared with those of CDK10 in MCF7 cells	 and they show that the major decrease in ETS2 levels observed upon CDK10 coexpression involves CDK10 kinase activity. Treatment of cells coexpressing Flag-ETS2	 CDK10	 and cyclin M with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 largely rescued Flag-ETS2 expression levels (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4.In a new window Download PPTFig. 4.CDK10/cyclin M controls ETS2 stability in human cancer derived cells.

(B) Western blot analysis of exogenously expressed Flag-ETS2 protein levels in MCF7 cells cotransfected with empty vectors or coexpressing Myc-CDK10 (wt or kd)	 or Myc-CDK10/CycM-V5-6His. The latter cells were treated for 16 h with the MG132 proteasome inhibitor. Proper expression of CDK10 and cyclin M tagged proteins was verified by Western blot analysis. (C and D) Western blot analysis of expression levels of exogenously expressed Flag-ETS2 wild-type or mutant proteins in MCF7 cells	 in the absence of (C) or in response to (D) Myc-CDK10/CycM-V5-6His expression. Quantifications are shown in Fig. S4 C and D.A mass spectrometry analysis of recombinant ETS2 phosphorylated by CDK10/cyclin M in vitro revealed the existence of multiple phosphorylated residues	 among which are two neighboring phospho-serines (at positions 220 and 225) that may form a phosphodegron (14) (Figs. S5â€“S8). To confirm this finding	 we compared the phosphorylation level of recombinant ETS2wt with that of ETS2SASA protein	 a mutant bearing alanine substitutions of these two serines. As expected from the existence of multiple phosphorylation sites	 we detected a small but reproducible	 significant decrease of phosphorylation level of ETS2SASA compared with ETS2wt (Fig. S9)	 thus confirming that Ser220/Ser225 are phosphorylated by CDK10/cyclin M. To establish a direct link between ETS2 phosphorylation by CDK10/cyclin M and degradation	 we examined the expression levels of Flag-ETS2SASA. In the absence of CDK10/cyclin M coexpression	 it did not differ significantly from that of Flag-ETS2. This is contrary to that of Flag-ETS2DBM	 bearing a deletion of the N-terminal destruction (D-) box that was previously shown to be involved in APC-Cdh1â€“mediated degradation of ETS2 (13) (Fig. 4C). However	 contrary to Flag-ETS2 wild type	 the expression level of Flag-ETS2SASA remained insensitive to CDK10/cyclin M coexpression (Fig. 4D). Altogether	 these results suggest that CDK10/cyclin M directly controls ETS2 degradation through the phosphorylation of these two serines.Finally	 we studied a lymphoblastoid cell line derived from a patient with STAR syndrome	 bearing FAM58A mutation c.555+1G>A	 predicted to result in aberrant splicing (10). In accordance with incomplete skewing of X chromosome inactivation previously found in this patient	 we detected a decreased expression level of cyclin M protein in the STAR cell line	 compared with a control lymphoblastoid cell line. In line with our preceding observations	 we detected an increased expression level of ETS2 protein in the STAR cell line compared with the control (Fig. 5A and Fig. S10A). We then examined by quantitative RT-PCR the mRNA expression levels of the corresponding genes. The STAR cell line showed a decreased expression level of cyclin M mRNA but an expression level of ETS2 mRNA similar to that of the control cell line (Fig. 5B). To demonstrate that the increase in ETS2 protein expression is indeed a result of the decreased cyclin M expression observed in the STAR patient-derived cell line	 we expressed cyclin M-V5-6His in this cell line. This expression caused a decrease in ETS2 protein levels (Fig. 5C).Fig. 5.In a new window Download PPTFig. 5.Decreased cyclin M expression in STAR patient-derived cells results in increased ETS2 protein level.

(C) Western blot analysis of ETS2 protein levels in the STAR patient-derived lymphoblastoid cell line transfected with an empty vector or a vector directing the expression of cyclin M-V5-6His. Another Western blot revealing endogenously and exogenously expressed cyclin M levels is shown in Fig. S10B. A quantification of ETS2 protein levels is shown in Fig. S10C.Previous SectionNext SectionDiscussionIn this work	 we unveil the interaction between CDK10	 the last orphan CDK discovered in the pregenomic era (2)	 and cyclin M	 the only cyclin associated with a human genetic disease so far	 and whose functions remain unknown (10). The closest paralogs of CDK10 within the CDK family are the CDK11 proteins	 which interact with L-type cyclins (15). Interestingly	 the closest paralog of these cyclins within the cyclin family is cyclin M (Fig. S11). The fact that none of the shorter CDK10 isoforms interact robustly with cyclin M suggests that alternative splicing of the CDK10 gene (16	 17) plays an important role in regulating CDK10 functions.The functional relevance of the interaction between CDK10 and cyclin M is supported by different observations. Both proteins seem to enhance each otherâ€™s stability	 as judged from their increased expression levels when their partner is exogenously coexpressed (Fig. 1D) and from the much reduced endogenous CDK10 expression level observed in response to cyclin M silencing (Fig. 3A and Fig. S2B). CDK10 is subject to ubiquitin-mediated degradation (18). Our observations suggest that cyclin M protects CDK10 from such degradation and that it is the only cyclin partner of CDK10	 at least in MCF7 cells. They also suggest that cyclin M stability is enhanced upon binding to CDK10	 independently from its kinase activity	 as seen for cyclin C and CDK8 (19). We uncover a cyclin M-dependent CDK10 protein kinase activity in vitro	 thus demonstrating that this protein	 which was named a CDK on the sole basis of its amino acid sequence	 is indeed a genuine cyclin-dependent kinase. Our Y2H assays reveal that truncated cyclin M proteins corresponding to the hypothetical products of two STAR syndrome-associated FAM58A mutations do not produce an interaction phenotype with CDK10. Hence	 regardless of whether these mutated mRNAs undergo nonsense-mediated decay (as suggested from the decreased cyclin M mRNA levels in STAR cells	 shown in Fig. 5B) or give rise to truncated cyclin M proteins	 females affected by the STAR syndrome must exhibit compromised CDK10/cyclin M kinase activity at least in some tissues and during specific developmental stages.We show that ETS2	 a known interactor of CDK10	 is a phosphorylation substrate of CDK10/cyclin M in vitro and that CDK10/cyclin M kinase activity positively controls ETS2 degradation by the proteasome. This control seems to be exerted through a very fine mechanism	 as judged from the sensitivity of ETS2 levels to partially decreased CDK10 and cyclin M levels	 achieved in MCF7 cells and observed in STAR cells	 respectively. These findings offer a straightforward explanation for the already reported up-regulation of ETS2-driven transcription of c-RAF in response to CDK10 silencing (6). We bring evidence that CDK10/cyclin M directly controls ETS2 degradation through the phosphorylation of two neighboring serines	 which may form a noncanonical Î²-TRCP phosphodegron (DSMCPAS) (14). Because none of these two serines precede a proline	 they do not conform to usual CDK phosphorylation sites. However	 multiple so-called transcriptional CDKs (CDK7	-8	-9	 and -11) (to which CDK10 may belong; Fig. S11) have been shown to phosphorylate a variety of motifs in a nonâ€“proline-directed fashion	 especially in the context of molecular docking with the substrate (20). Here	 it can be hypothesized that the high-affinity interaction between CDK10 and the Pointed domain of ETS2 (6	 9) (Fig. 1C) would allow docking-mediated phosphorylation of atypical sites. The control of ETS2 degradation involves a number of players	 including APC-Cdh1 (13) and the cullin-RING ligase CRL4 (21). The formal identification of the ubiquitin ligase involved in the CDK10/cyclin M pathway and the elucidation of its concerted action with the other ubiquitin ligases to regulate ETS2 degradation will require further studies.Our results present a number of significant biological and medical implications. First	 they shed light on the regulation of ETS2	 which plays an important role in development (22) and is frequently deregulated in many cancers (23). Second	 our results contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms causing tamoxifen resistance associated with reduced CDK10 expression levels	 and they suggest that	 like CDK10 (6)	 cyclin M could also be a predictive clinical marker of hormone therapy response of ERÎ±-positive breast cancer patients. Third	 our findings offer an interesting hypothesis on the molecular mechanisms underlying STAR syndrome. Ets2 transgenic mice showing a less than twofold overexpression of Ets2 present severe cranial abnormalities (24)	 and those observed in STAR patients could thus be caused at least in part by increased ETS2 protein levels. Another expected consequence of enhanced ETS2 expression levels would be a decreased risk to develop certain types of cancers and an increased risk to develop others. Studies on various mouse models (including models of Down syndrome	 in which three copies of ETS2 exist) have revealed that ETS2 dosage can repress or promote tumor growth and	 hence	 that ETS2 exerts noncell autonomous functions in cancer (25). Intringuingly	 one of the very few STAR patients identified so far has been diagnosed with a nephroblastoma (26). Finally	 our findings will facilitate the general exploration of the biological functions of CDK10 and	 in particular	 its role in the control of cell division. Previous studies have suggested either a positive role in cell cycle control (5	 6) or a tumor-suppressive activity in some cancers (7	 8). The severe growth retardation exhibited by STAR patients strongly suggests that CDK10/cyclin M plays an important role in the control of cell proliferation.Previous SectionNext SectionMaterials and MethodsCloning of CDK10 and cyclin M cDNAs	 plasmid constructions	 tamoxifen response analysis	 quantitative RT-PCR	 mass spectrometry experiments	 and antibody production are detailed in SI Materials and Methods.Yeast Two-Hybrid Interaction Assays.

We generated recombinant bacmids in DH10Bac Escherichia coli and baculoviruses in Sf9 cells using the Bac-to-Bac system	 as described by the provider (Invitrogen). We infected Sf9 cells with GST-CDK10- (or GST-CDK10kd)-producing viruses	 or coinfected the cells with StrepII-CycMâ€“producing viruses	 and we collected the cells 72 h after infection. To purify GST-fusion proteins	 we spun 250 mL cells and resuspended the pellet in 40 mL lysis buffer (PBS	 250 mM NaCl	 0.5% Nonidet P-40	 50 mM NaF	 10 mM Î²-glycerophosphate	 and 0.3 mM Na-vanadate) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche).

We transformed Origami2 DE3 (Novagen) with the 6His-ETS2 expression vector. We induced expression with 0.2 mM isopropyl-Î²-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 22 Â°C. To purify 6His-ETS2	 we spun 50 mL cells and resuspended the pellet in 2 mL lysis buffer (PBS	 300 mM NaCl	 10 mM Imidazole	 1 mM DTT	 and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing a protease inhibitor mixture without EDTA (Roche). We lysed the cells at 1.6 bar using a cell disruptor and spun the lysate 10 min at 20	000 Ã— g. We collected the soluble fraction and added it to 200 Î¼L Cobalt beads (Thermo Scientific). After 1 h incubation at 4 Â°C on a rotating wheel	 we washed four times with lysis buffer. To elute	 we incubated beads 30 min with elution buffer (PBS	 250 mM imidazole	 pH 7.6) containing the protease inhibitor mixture	 spun 30 s at 10	000 Ã— g	 and collected the eluted protein.Protein Kinase Assays. We mixed glutathione-Sepharose beads (harboring GST-CDK10 wt or kd	 either monomeric or complexed with StrepII-CycM)	 22.7 Î¼M BSA	 15 mM DTT	 100 Î¼M ATP	 5 Î¼Ci ATP[Î³-32P]	 7.75 Î¼M histone H1	 or 1 Î¼M 6His-ETS2 and added kinase buffer A (25 mM TrisÂ·HCl	 10 mM MgCl2	 1 mM EGTA	 1 mM DTT	 and 3.7 Î¼M heparin	 pH 7.5) up to a total volume of 30 Î¼L. We incubated the reactions 30 min at 30 Â°C	 added Laemli sample buffer	 heat-denatured the samples	 and ran 10% Bis-Tris SDS/PAGE. We cut gel slices to detect GST-CDK10 and StrepII-CycM by Western blotting. We stained the gel slices containing the substrate with Coomassie (R-250	 Bio-Rad)	 dried them	 and detected the incorporated radioactivity by autoradiography. We identified four unrelated girls with anogenital and renal malformations	 dysmorphic facial features	 normal intellect and syndactyly of toes. A similar combination of features had been reported previously in a motherâ€“daughter pair1 (Table 1 and Supplementary Note online). These authors noted clinical overlap with Townes-Brocks syndrome but suggested that the phenotype represented a separate autosomal dominant entity (MIM601446). Here we define the cardinal features of this syndrome as a characteristic facial appearance with apparent telecanthus and broad tripartite nasal tip	 variable syndactyly of toes 2â€“5	 hypoplastic labia	 anal atresia and urogenital malformations (Fig. 1aâ€“h). We also observed a variety of other features (Table 1).  Figure 1: Clinical and molecular characterization of STAR syndrome.  Figure 1 : Clinical and molecular characterization of STAR syndrome. (aâ€“f) Facial appearances of cases 1â€“3 (apparent telecanthus	 dysplastic ears and thin upper lips; a	c	e)	 and toe syndactyly 2â€“5	 3â€“5 or 4â€“5 (b	d	f) in these cases illustrate recognizable features of STAR syndrome (specific parental consent has been obtained for publication of these photographs). Anal atresia and hypoplastic labia are not shown. (g	h) X-ray films of the feet of case 2 showing only four rays on the left and delta-shaped 4th and 5th metatarsals on the right (h; compare to clinical picture in d). (i) Array-CGH data. Log2 ratio represents copy number loss of six probes spanning between 37.9 and 50.7 kb	 with one probe positioned within FAM58A. The deletion does not remove parts of other functional genes. (j) Schematic structure of FAM58A and position of the mutations. FAM58A has five coding exons (boxes). The cyclin domain (green) is encoded by exons 2â€“4. The horizontal arrow indicates the deletion extending 5' in case 1	 which includes exons 1 and 2	 whereas the horizontal line below exon 5 indicates the deletion found in case 3	 which removes exon 5 and some 3' sequence. The pink horizontal bars above the boxes indicate the amplicons used for qPCR and sequencing (one alternative exon 5 amplicon is not indicated because of space constraints). The mutation 201dupT (case 4) results in an immediate stop codon	 and the 555+1G>A and 555-1G>A splice mutations in cases 2	 5 and 6 are predicted to be deleterious because they alter the conserved splice donor and acceptor site of intron 4	 respectively.  Full size image (97 KB)  Table 1: Clinical features in STAR syndrome cases  Table 1 - Clinical features in STAR syndrome cases  Full table  On the basis of the phenotypic overlap with Townes-Brocks	 Okihiro and Feingold syndromes	 we analyzed SALL1 (ref. 2)	 SALL4 (ref. 3) and MYCN4 but found no mutations in any of these genes (Supplementary Methods online). Next	 we carried out genome-wide high-resolution oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH)5 analysis (Supplementary Methods) of genomic DNA from the most severely affected individual (case 1	 with lower lid coloboma	 epilepsy and syringomyelia) and identified a heterozygous deletion of 37.9â€“50.7 kb on Xq28	 which removed exons 1 and 2 of FAM58A (Fig. 1i	j). Using real-time PCR	 we confirmed the deletion in the child and excluded it in her unaffected parents (Supplementary Fig. 1a online	 Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Table 1 online). Through CGH with a customized oligonucleotide array enriched in probes for Xq28	 followed by breakpoint cloning	 we defined the exact deletion size as 40	068 bp (g.152	514	164_152	554	231del(chromosome X	 NCBI Build 36.2); Fig. 1j and Supplementary Figs. 2	3 online). The deletion removes the coding regions of exons 1 and 2 as well as intron 1 (2	774 bp)	 492 bp of intron 2	 and 36	608 bp of 5' sequence	 including the 5' UTR and the entire KRT18P48 pseudogene (NCBI gene ID 340598). Paternity was proven using routine methods. We did not find deletions overlapping FAM58A in the available copy number variation (CNV) databases.  Subsequently	 we carried out qPCR analysis of the three other affected individuals (cases 2	 3 and 4) and the mother-daughter pair from the literature (cases 5 and 6). In case 3	 we detected a de novo heterozygous deletion of 1.1â€“10.3 kb overlapping exon 5 (Supplementary Fig. 1b online). Using Xq28-targeted array CGH and breakpoint cloning	 we identified a deletion of 4	249 bp (g.152	504	123_152	508	371del(chromosome X	 NCBI Build 36.2); Fig. 1j and Supplementary Figs. 2	3)	 which removed 1	265 bp of intron 4	 all of exon 5	 including the 3' UTR	 and 2	454 bp of 3' sequence.  We found heterozygous FAM58A point mutations in the remaining cases (Fig. 1j	 Supplementary Fig. 2	 Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Table 1). In case 2	 we identified the mutation 555+1G>A	 affecting the splice donor site of intron 4. In case 4	 we identified the frameshift mutation 201dupT	 which immediately results in a premature stop codon N68XfsX1. In cases 5 and 6	 we detected the mutation 556-1G>A	 which alters the splice acceptor site of intron 4. We validated the point mutations and deletions by independent rounds of PCR and sequencing or by qPCR. We confirmed paternity and de novo status of the point mutations and deletions in all sporadic cases. None of the mutations were seen in the DNA of 60 unaffected female controls	 and no larger deletions involving FAM58A were found in 93 unrelated array-CGH investigations.  By analyzing X-chromosome inactivation (Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Fig. 4 online)	 we found complete skewing of X inactivation in cases 1 and 3â€“6 and almost complete skewing in case 2	 suggesting that cells carrying the mutation on the active X chromosome have a growth disadvantage during fetal development. Using RT-PCR on RNA from lymphoblastoid cells of case 2 (Supplementary Fig. 2)	 we did not find any aberrant splice products as additional evidence that the mutated allele is inactivated. Furthermore	 FAM58A is subjected to X inactivation6. In cases 1 and 3	 the parental origin of the deletions could not be determined	 as a result of lack of informative SNPs. Case 5	 the mother of case 6	 gave birth to two boys	 both clinically unaffected (samples not available). We cannot exclude that the condition is lethal in males. No fetal losses were reported from any of the families.  The function of FAM58A is unknown. The gene consists of five coding exons	 and the 642-bp coding region encodes a protein of 214 amino acids. GenBank lists a mRNA length of 1	257 bp for the reference sequence (NM_152274.2). Expression of the gene (by EST data) was found in 27 of 48 adult tissues including kidney	 colon	 cervix and uterus	 but not heart (NCBI expression viewer	 UniGene Hs.496943). Expression was also noted in 24 of 26 listed tumor tissues as well as in embryo and fetus. Genes homologous to FAM58A (NCBI HomoloGene: 13362) are found on the X chromosome in the chimpanzee and the dog. The zebrafish has a similar gene on chromosome 23. However	 in the mouse and rat	 there are no true homologs. These species have similar but intronless genes on chromosomes 11 (mouse) and 10 (rat)	 most likely arising from a retrotransposon insertion event. On the murine X chromosome	 the flanking genes Atp2b3 and Dusp9 are conserved	 but only remnants of the FAM58A sequence can be detected.  FAM58A contains a cyclin-box-fold domain	 a protein-binding domain found in cyclins with a role in cell cycle and transcription control. No human phenotype resulting from a cyclin gene mutation has yet been reported. Homozygous knockout mice for Ccnd1 (encoding cyclin D1) are viable but small and have reduced lifespan. They also have dystrophic changes of the retina	 likely as a result of decreased cell proliferation and degeneration of photoreceptor cells during embryogenesis7	 8.  Cyclin D1 colocalizes with SALL4 in the nucleus	 and both proteins cooperatively mediate transcriptional repression9. As the phenotype of our cases overlaps considerably with that of Townes-Brocks syndrome caused by SALL1 mutations1	 we carried out co-immunoprecipitation to find out if SALL1 or SALL4 would interact with FAM58A in a manner similar to that observed for SALL4 and cyclin D1. We found that FAM58A interacts with SALL1 but not with SALL4 (Supplementary Fig. 5 online)	 supporting the hypothesis that FAM58A and SALL1 participate in the same developmental pathway.  How do FAM58A mutations lead to STAR syndrome? Growth retardation (all cases; Table 1) and retinal abnormalities (three cases) are reminiscent of the reduced body size and retinal anomalies in cyclin D1 knockout mice7	 8. Therefore	 a proliferation defect might be partly responsible for STAR syndrome. To address this question	 we carried out a knockdown of FAM58A mRNA followed by a proliferation assay. Transfection of HEK293 cells with three different FAM58A-specific RNAi oligonucleotides resulted in a significant reduction of both FAM58A mRNA expression and proliferation of transfected cells (Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Fig. 6 online)	 supporting the link between FAM58A and cell proliferation.  We found that loss-of-function mutations of FAM58A result in a rather homogeneous clinical phenotype. The additional anomalies in case 1 are likely to result from an effect of the 40-kb deletion on expression of a neighboring gene	 possibly ATP2B3 or DUSP9. However	 we cannot exclude that the homogeneous phenotype results from an ascertainment bias and that FAM58A mutations	 including missense changes	 could result in a broader spectrum of malformations. The genes causing the overlapping phenotypes of STAR syndrome and Townes-Brocks syndrome seem to act in the same pathway. Of note	 MYCN	 a gene mutated in Feingold syndrome	 is a direct regulator of cyclin D2 (refs. 10	11); thus	 it is worth exploring whether the phenotypic similarities between Feingold and STAR syndrome might be explained by direct regulation of FAM58A by MYCN.  FAM58A is located approximately 0.56 Mb centromeric to MECP2 on Xq28. Duplications overlapping both MECP2 and FAM58A have been described and are not associated with a clinical phenotype in females12	 but no deletions overlapping both MECP2 and FAM58A have been observed to date13. Although other genes between FAM58A and MECP2 have been implicated in brain development	 FAM58A and MECP2 are the only genes in this region known to result in X-linked dominant phenotypes; thus	 deletion of both genes on the same allele might be lethal in both males and females. 																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															
2	1|| Abstract Background  Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a heterogeneous group of disorders with a number of genetic and proteomic alterations. c-CBL is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and adaptor molecule important in normal homeostasis and cancer. We determined the genetic variations of c-CBL	 relationship to receptor tyrosine kinases (EGFR and MET)	 and functionality in NSCLC.  Methods and Findings  Using archival formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) extracted genomic DNA	 we show that c-CBL mutations occur in somatic fashion for lung cancers. c-CBL mutations were not mutually exclusive of MET or EGFR mutations; however they were independent of p53 and KRAS mutations. In normal/tumor pairwise analysis	 there was significant loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for the c-CBL locus (22%	 nâ€Š=â€Š8/37) and none of these samples revealed any mutation in the remaining copy of c-CBL. The c-CBL LOH also positively correlated with EGFR and MET mutations observed in the same samples. Using select c-CBL somatic mutations such as S80N/H94Y	 Q249E and W802* (obtained from Caucasian	 Taiwanese and African-American samples	 respectively) transfected in NSCLC cell lines	 there was increased cell viability and cell motility.  Conclusions  Taking the overall mutation rate of c-CBL to be a combination as somatic missense mutation and LOH	 it is clear that c-CBL is highly mutated in lung cancers and may play an essential role in lung tumorigenesis and metastasis.  Go to: Introduction In the US alone	 each year approximately 219	400 people are diagnosed with lung cancers	 out of which more than 145	000 of them succumb to the disease [1]. This number is roughly equivalent to the combined mortality rates of cancers of the breast	 prostate	 colon	 liver	 kidney and melanoma [1]. In addition the prognosis is usually poor and the five-year survival rate is less than 15%. There are also significant ethnic differences for lung cancer	 and the outcome is worse for blacks compared to whites. Gender differences are also striking with women having significantly better prognosis as compared to men. There are a number of genetic alterations that can occur in lung cancer. As an example	 in NSCLC	 mutations in KRAS	 p53	 EGFR and MET have been identified. Many of these pathways	 especially Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) are controlled by c-CBL.  CBL (Casitas B-lineage lymphoma) is a mammalian gene located on human chromosome 11q23.3 [2] and is involved in cell signaling and protein ubiquitination [3]. CBL proteins belong to the RING finger class of ubiquitin ligases (E3) and there are three homologues c-CBL	 CBL-b	 CBL-3 [4]. The c-CBL and CBL-b genes are ubiquitously expressed with the highest levels in hematopoietic tissues [5]. c-CBL consists of four regions encoding for functionally distinct protein domains: the N-terminal tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain	 the linker region	 the catalytic RING finger domain	 the proline-rich region and the c-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain that also overlaps with a leucine-zipper (LZ) domain [3]. Both TKB and RING finger domains are essential for ligand-induced ubiquitination of RTKs [6]	 [7]	 [8]	 [9]. The RING finger domain is required for the recruitment of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. The TKB domain includes four-helix bundle (4H)	 a calcium-biding EF hand	 and a modified SH2 domain	 which binds to phosphotyrosine residues [3]	 [10]	 [11]	 [12]. In addition	 the proline-rich region of c-CBL can associate with the SH3 domain of Grb2	 which can indirectly recruit c-CBL to RTKs via the GRB2 adaptor protein [7]	 [13]	 [14].  c-CBL also binds to EGFR and acts as the E3 that targets EGFR for ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore	 CBL desensitizes EGF signaling and opposes cellular proliferation induced by EGF [15]. EGF activation also appears to activate the tyrosine kinase SRC	 which phosphorylates c-CBL and in turn activates the ubiquitination and degradation of EGFR [16]	 [17]	 [18]. A recent study shows that defective endocytosis of EGFR is characterized by a deletion mutant and the point mutation L858R	 whereby its association with c-CBL and subsequent ubiquitination are impaired [19]. Recently	 the first human c-CBL mutations were reported in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients [20]. The mutation R420Q inhibits FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) internalization and ubiquitination [20].  Not only can E3 activity be important in oncogenesis	 c-CBL has a dual but separate function as a signal transduction molecule. We have previously shown that c-CBL is important in binding CRKL and BCR/ABL in hematopoietic cells. Also	 it can bind and modulate functions of cytoskeleton by binding to proteins like talin and paxillin. The TKB domain is important in binding to a number of molecules	 and they then function in signal transduction.  Given the critical role of CBL in normal homeostasis and cancer	 we hypothesized that it might be mutated in lung cancers. In this study	 we report novel c-CBL somatic mutations S80N/H94Y	 Q249E and W802* in Caucasian	 Taiwanese and African-American lung cancer patients	 respectively. Expressing these mutations in NSCLC cell lines lead to increased proliferation and cell motility. We show that c-CBL mutations occur with or without MET or EGFR mutations but are mutually exclusive of a LOH at the c-CBL locus. Additionally	 c-CBL LOH is associated with either MET or EGFR mutations. We thus hypothesize that c-CBL mutations might contribute to the oncogenic potential of MET and EGFR in lung cancer.

The following is their contact information: Institutional Review Board	 The University of Chicago	 McGiffert Hall	 5751 S. Woodlawn Ave.	 2nd floor	 Chicago	 IL 60637. Written informed consents were received from all patients whose tissue samples were used for this study.  Tissue Samples  Lung cancer tissue and paired adjacent normal lung tissues were obtained from 50 Caucasian	 29 African-Americans and 40 Taiwanese NSCLC patients who were recruited at the University of Chicago Hospital (Chicago	 USA) (Caucasian and African-American patients) and Taipei Veterans General Hospital of Taiwan (Taiwanese patients) after obtaining appropriate Institutional Review Board permission and informed consent from the patients. Out of 119 samples	 77 were men	 38 were women and 4 were unknown with age at diagnosis ranging from 47 to 90 years. In terms of tumor types	 53 were adenocarcinoma	 32 were squamous cell carcinoma and 34 were large cell carcinoma. 49 were stage I	 14 were stage II	 34 were stage III	 and 13 were stage IV (Table S1).  Cell Culture  Human non-small cell lung carcinoma cells A549 and H358 were maintained in DMEM and RPMI-1640	 respectively. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were cultured in DMEM. Media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum	 100 units/ml of penicillin	 and 100 Âµg/ml of streptomycin (Invitrogen	 Carlsbad	 CA). Cells were cultured at 37Â°C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2.  c-CBL Gene Mutational Analysis  Exons 2 to 16 of c-CBL gene were individually amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Primers are listed in Table S2. PCR conditions were 1 cycle of 95Â°C for 5 minutes; 35 cycles of 94Â°C for 30 seconds	 58Â°C for 30 seconds and 72Â°C for 2 minutes; and one cycle of 72Â°C for 10 minutes. PCR products were treated with ExoSAP-IT (USB Corporation	 Cleveland	 OH) and sequenced by Big-Dye Terminator Chemistry (Applied Biosystems	 Foster City	 CA). Sequencing was performed on the forward coding strand with confirmation of c-CBL alterations performed by sequencing the reverse strand as well. Chromatograms were analyzed for mutations using Mutation Surveyor v2.61 (Softgenetics	 State College	 PA).  Plasmid Constructs and Site-Directed Mutagenesis  The wild-type c-CBL cDNA insert was subcloned into the pAlterMax expression vector using XhoI and SalI restriction enzyme sites (Promega	 Madison	 WI). Using this parental plasmid pAlterMax-c-CBL	 the TKB domain double mutation (S80N/H94Y)	 the point mutation (Q249E)	 and the C-terminal point mutation W802* of c-CBL were created using the following primers: 5â€²-GCTGGCGCTAAAGAATAACCCACCTTATATCTTAGAC-3â€² and 5â€²-CTACCAGATACCTACCAGTATCTCCGTACTATCTTGTC-3â€² for the double mutation S80N/H94Y; 5â€²-CTTTACCCGACTCTTTGAGCCCTGGTCCTCTTTGC-3â€² for Q249E	 and 5â€²-CAGCTCCTCCTTTGGCTGATTGTCTCTGGATGGTGATC-3â€² for W802* along with their complementary primers using the QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis XL kit (Stratagene	 La Jolla	 CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The constructs were confirmed for the point mutations by standard DNA sequencing of both strands.  Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) Analysis  Five microsatellites on chromosome 11 (3 on 11q at or within 200 kb up or downstream of the c-CBL gene and 2 control markers on 11p) were selected for analysis (Table S3). Established microsatellite markers and respective primer sequences were selected from the GeneLoc database (http://genecards.weizmann.ac.il/geneloc/index.shtml	 Weizmann Institute of Science	 Rehovot	 Israel). Primers were custom designed and each forward primer was fluorescently labeled at the 5â€² end with FAM	 PET	 NED	 or VIC (Applied Biosystems). Primer annealing temperatures and duplex scores were evaluated with NIST Primer Tools (http://yellow.nist.gov:8444/dnaAnalysis/primerToolsPage.do; National Institute of Standards and Technology	 Gaithersburg	 MD). Primers were verified by performing PCR with control DNA (isolated from TK6 cells) and resolving the products on agarose gels. Bands were visualized with an UV transilluminator. Genomic DNA was extracted from tumor samples and paired normal lung tissue. Primers were grouped into multiplex combinations shown in Table S4. Marker D11S929 served as an internal control to check for consistency in PCRs and of peaks from capillary electrophoresis. Multiplex PCRs were carried out in a volume of 10 ÂµL that contained 1 ÂµL genomic DNA (20â€“50 ng)	 0.5 ÂµM of each primer (1.0 ÂµM total for each primer pair)	 400 ÂµM dNTPs	 1X PCR buffer containing MgCl2	 and 0.2 U Taq DNA polymerase. PCR was performed on the ABI GeneAmp 9700 PCR System under the following conditions: 5 min at 94Â°C; 30 cycles of 30 sec at 94Â°C	 1 min at 60Â°C	 1 min at 72Â°C; and 5 min at 72Â°C. The PCR products were separated by capillary electrophoresis on an ABI 3130XL DNA Analyzer. Chromatograms were analyzed with Peak Scanner 1.0 and GeneMapper 3.7 software (Applied Biosystems) for allelic alterations. The area of the peaks produced by the DNA PCR products was quantified for each allele. The ratio of the allelic areas was calculated for each tumor and paired normal DNA sample. When the qLOH (allelic ratio for the tumor peaks divided by the allelic ratio of paired normal sample) was â‰¤0.5 or â‰¥2.0 for c-CBL and at least one other 11q marker in at least two separate experiments	 the sample was considered as having an allelic imbalance and interpreted as LOH. Samples were evaluated in at least two separate experiments and samples showing prospective LOH at c-CBL repeated a third time which included a new control marker at the BAX locus (data not shown) on chromosome 19 to verify integrity of sample DNA.  Transfection of c-Cbl Constructs  The A549 cell line was transfected using the Fugene HD (Roche	 Nutley	 NJ) reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Eight Âµg of plasmid DNA	 containing either no insert (empty vector)	 wild-type c-CBL	 S80N/H94Y c-CBL	 Q249E c-CBL or W802* CBL was used for transfection in a 6-well culture plate. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and analyzed for expression.  c-CBL Knockdown  c-CBL knockdown was performed using lentiviral transduction using MISSION lentiviral transduction particles (Sigma-Aldrich	 St. Louis	 MO) as per manufacturer's instructions. Briefly	 1Ã—105 H358 cells/well were seeded in 6-well plates and infected the following day with c-CBL lentiviral shRNA constructs. To generate stable c-CBL knockdown cell lines	 cells were selected for 2 days with 1 Âµg/ml puromycin. c-CBL levels were determined using whole cell lysates by immunoblotting with anti-CBL antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies	 Santa Cruz	 CA).  Cell Viability Assay  Cells were transfected as described above in the transfection assay. Forty-eight hours after transfection	 viability of cells was assessed using Trypan Blue exclusion.  Wound Healing Assay  A549 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and cultured for 48 h until 100% confluent. The medium was then changed and the cells were transfected as described in the transfection assay. Twelve hours after transfection	 a straight scratch was made across the cell layer using a 1 ml pipette tip. The cells were then gently washed with 1Ã— PBS to remove cellular debris and the media was replaced. Photographs were taken of the wound region every 12 h until 48 h.  Western Blot Analysis  Forty eight hours after transfection	 cells were collected and washed twice in 1X PBS	 then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (0.5M Tris-HCl with pH 7.4	 1.5 M NaCl	 2.5% deoxycholic acid	 10 mM EDTA	 10% NP-40	 0.5 mM DTT	 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride	 5 Âµg/mL leupeptin	 and 10 Âµg/mL aprotinin) for 5 minutes. The lysate was centrifuged at 13	000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4Â°C	 and protein content of the supernatant was measured. Total cell lysates (50 Âµg/well) were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and the gels transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman	 Piscataway	 NJ). Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing Tween-20 (PBST) (1X PBS	 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with the appropriate primary antibody at 4Â°C overnight. Membranes then were washed three times with PBST and probed with appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were again washed three times in PBST and bands were visualized using Western blot chemiluminescence reagent (BioRad	 Valencia	 CA) on a Chemidoc Gel documentation system (BioRad	 Valencia	 CA). Antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies and used at the following dilutions (c-CBL	 1âˆ¶5000; c-MET	 1âˆ¶5000; EGFR	 1âˆ¶5000; ubiquitin	 1âˆ¶1000; HA	 1âˆ¶5000 and Î²-actin	 1âˆ¶10	000).  Flow Cytometry  Cell cycle analysis was carried out by flow cytometry. Approximately 2Ã—106 cells were grown in media containing 10% FBS. Cells were harvested by trypsin/EDTA treatment	 washed with 1X PBS three times and fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol for 2 h. Cells were washed again with cold PBS and stained with a solution containing 25 Âµg/mL propidium iodide	 200 Âµg/mL RNase A	 and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 minutes in the dark. Cell cycle analysis was performed using a Guava PCA-96 flow cytometer (Guava Technologies	 Millipore	 Billerica	 MA).  Ubiquitin Ligase Activity  293T cells were maintained in culture in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin (100 units/mL) and streptomycin (100 Âµg/mL) were transfected with 0.2 Âµg EGFR-pcDNA3 and 2 Âµg HA-tagged c-CBL constructs as indicated using calcium phosphate according to manufacturer's protocol (Profection	 Promega	 Madison	 WI). Twenty-four hours post-transfection	 cells were starved overnight in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS	 and then treated with or without EGF (100 ng/ml) for 15 min. The cells were collected and washed two times in ice-cold PBS containing 0.2 mM sodium orthovanadate then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris HCl	 pH 7.5	 150 mM NaCl	 5 mM EDTA	 1% Triton X100	 10% Glycerol	 2 mM sodium orthovanadate and protease inhibitors). Lysates were cleared of debris by centrifugation at 16	000 g for 10 min at 4Â°C. EGFR immunoprecipitations were performed on 200 Âµg of cleared lysate using 250 ng of rabbit-anti-EGFR and Protein A/G Plus Sepharose overnight at 4Â°C. Precipitations were washed 5 times in lysis buffer before boiling in Laemmli buffer. Elutions were immunoblotted with anti-ubiquitin and EGFR. Twenty micrograms of cleared lysate were immunoblotted for each of the c-CBL constructs using anti-HA.  Statistical Analysis  Mutation rates between different groups were compared using Fisher's exact test. For continuous variables	 group comparisons were performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Sidak's adjustment for multiple comparisons. Experiments involving repeated measurements over time were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA with the Greenhouse-Geisser adjustment to the degrees of freedom. Analyses were conducted using STATA (v10.1) software (Stata Corporation	 College Station	 TX).  Go to: Results c-CBL Gene Mutations in Lung Cancer  To investigate the role of c-CBL in lung cancer	 we analyzed its genomic DNA in tumor and paired normal samples drawn from multiple ethnicities. The lung tumor samples represented Caucasians (nâ€Š=â€Š50)	 African-Americans (nâ€Š=â€Š29)	 and Taiwanese (nâ€Š=â€Š40) lung cancer patients. We designed 12 pairs of primers to sequence the coding region of c-CBL gene that spans exons 2 to 16 (Table S2). We identified 8 unique somatic mutations in c-CBL exons among 8 different patients. A variation L620F	 a known SNP (rs2227988) in exon 11 was also detected. Importantly	 the eight novel non-synonymous mutations were confirmed by sequencing both strands of c-CBL genomic DNA obtained from lung tumor samples (Table 1). Moreover	 none of the 8 mutations were detected in the corresponding normal tissue	 indicating that these were somatic mutations. Four synonymous single nucleotide variations (SNVs) were also identified but were not used further in this study.  Table 1 Table 1 c-CBL mutation analysis in 119 lung cancer patient tumor tissues. Three of the 8 novel non-synonymous mutations were located in the TKB (tyrosine kinase binding) domain (S80N	 H94Y	 and Q249E)	 one in the RING finger domain (V391I)	 one in the proline-rich region (72515_72517 del ATG)	 and three in the C-terminal region (W802*	 R830K	 and A848T) of the c-CBL protein (Figure 1A and Figure S1). In Figure 1B	 we show model chromatograms of representative samples.  Figure 1 Figure 1 c-CBL mutations and LOH in non-small cell lung cancer. 11q LOH of c-CBL Gene  Paired lung tumor and normal lung tissue samples from Taiwanese patients (nâ€Š=â€Š37) were investigated for LOH. Eight (21.6%) showed LOH at the c-CBL locus on chromosome 11 while 29 samples (78.4%) revealed normal allelic contribution at the microsatellite markers (Figures 1C and D).  c-CBL Mutations in Different Ethnic Groups  The c-CBL double mutant S80N/H94Y was found in the same patient and the overall mutation rate for c-CBL in lung tumors was 6.7% (8/119). The frequency of c-CBL mutation was highest in large cell carcinoma (14.7%; 5 of 34 patients) followed by squamous carcinoma (6.3%; 2 of 32 patients) and the least was observed in adenocarcinoma (AD) (1.8%; 1 of 53 patients)	 although these rates were not statistically significant (pâ€Š=â€Š0.292). Mutation rates were 6.0% among Caucasians (0 of 20 in AD; 0 of 10 in SQ; and 3 of 20 in LC)	 13.8% in African-Americans (1 of 10 in AD; 1 of 10 in SQ; and 2 of 9 in LC)	 and 2.5% (0 of 23 in AD; 1 of 12 in SQ; and 0 of 5 in LC) in the Taiwanese population. Additionally two Taiwanese patients with lung cancer (one squamous and one adenocarcinoma) had the known SNP L620F. Ethnic differences were not statistically significant	 however the power to detect differences was low.  Mutations in MET and EGFR Can Be Co-Associated with c-CBL Alterations  Since East Asians with lung cancer have a higher frequency of EGFR and MET mutations in lung tumors [21]	 [22]	 we also determined mutations in EGFR and MET in the same Taiwanese cohort samples and compared the results with the observed c-CBL alterations (LOH and/or mutations). In the 37 samples tested	 we did not find any overlap between c-CBL mutations and c-CBL LOH (Figure 2). Of the three c-CBL mutants (including the known L620F SNP	 rs2227988)	 one of the samples had a MET mutation (N375S) and the other had an EGFR mutation (L858R). Among the 8 samples that had a LOH at the c-CBL locus 5 had an additional mutation in MET (N375S) and 2 had an EGFR exon 19 deletion. Twenty-six samples had neither c-CBL mutation nor c-CBL LOH (3 patients had a c-CBL mutation but no c-CBL LOH). Among these 26 samples 9 had a MET mutation (8 N375S	 1 L211W)	 13 had an EGFR mutation (7 exon 9 deletion	 6 L858R) and 4 had no other MET or EGFR mutation. Thus the rate of MET or EGFR mutations among patients with LOH at the c-CBL locus (7 of 8) was similar to that seen in patients without c-CBL mutation or LOH (22 of 26 patients) (pâ€Š=â€Š0.99). These 4 patients with no identifiable mutation in c-CBL	 MET or EGFR represented 10.8% of the 37 patients analyzed in the Taiwanese patient cohort. Conversely	 89.2% Taiwanese lung cancer patients have an identifiable mutation in either c-CBL	 MET or EGFR or a combination of the three genes (Figure 2). Additionally	 we determined p53 and KRAS mutations in these Taiwanese cohorts. Two p53 and 1 KRAS mutation were detected. The single KRAS mutation overlapped with one p53 mutation. This patient also had the EGFR exon 19 deletion but had no c-CBL mutation. The other p53 mutation sample had a c-CBL LOH with concurrent MET N375S mutation. Thus	 in the Taiwanese samples analyzed	 p53/KRAS mutations and c-CBL mutations were mutually exclusive (data not shown).  Figure 2 Figure 2 c-CBL mutations and relationship to MET and EGFR mutations in lung cancer. Cellular Functions of c-CBL Alterations in the Context of Lung Tumorigenesis  A. E3 activity is intact in the mutant c-CBL proteins To investigate whether the different c-CBL mutations affect the E3 activity	 EGFR was chosen as a model substrate for c-CBL E3 function. All of the c-CBL mutants tested enhanced ubiquitination of the activated EGFR similar to the wild-type c-CBL protein. This result demonstrates that the catalytic activity of the c-CBL mutants is not impaired when EGFR was the substrate. (Figure 3A).  Figure 3 Figure 3 Ubiquitination	 viability	 expression and cell cycle analysis of various c-CBL mutants. B. Effect on lung cancer cell viability The effect of a representative c-CBL mutant from each of the three ethnic backgrounds on lung cancer cell viability in cell lines was determined. S80N/H94Y double mutation	 Q249E	 and W802* were identified in lung tumor samples obtained from a Caucasian	 a Taiwanese and an African-American	 respectively. As described in methods	 the c-CBL wild-type (WT) and the above three mutants were expressed after cloning them into pAlterMax vector in A549 cells. These cells express relatively low basal levels of endogenous c-CBL (data not shown). Transfection efficiency was comparable between different groups and the number of cells transfected with c-CBL wild-type construct was about 70% compared to control cells that were transfected with the empty vector. Cells transfected with S80N/H94Y	 Q249E and W802* c-CBL mutant constructs resulted in increased number of viable cells that was 132.3%	 120.8% and 147.9% higher respectively	 relative to the empty vector control transfected cells and significantly different from the wild-type construct (pâ€Š=â€Š0.022	 pâ€Š=â€Š0.049	 and pâ€Š=â€Š0.008	 respectively) (Figure 3B). Relative levels of c-CBL protein in whole cell lysates prepared from samples obtained from a parallel experiment was determined. The c-CBL protein levels in samples representing untransfected and empty vector transfected cells were comparable and those representing the c-CBL WT and the three c-CBL mutants were comparable (Figure 3C).  C. Effect on cell cycle To investigate if the increases in cell viability in different c-CBL mutants are due to increased cellular proliferation	 a cell cycle analysis was performed. A549 cells were transfected with the c-CBL WT or the three different mutants: S80N/H94Y	 Q249E and W802*. The empty vector transfectant was used as a control. Forty-eight hours after transfection cell cycle analysis was performed as described in materials and methods. There was no significant change in the subG1	 G1 or the S phase of the cell cycle among the different mutants compared to the WT construct (pâ€Š=â€Š0.64	 pâ€Š=â€Š0.40	 and pâ€Š=â€Š0.28	 respectively). The G2/M phase of the cell cycle showed an increase in cell numbers for the three mutants	 S80N/H94Y	 Q249E and W802*	 when compared to the WT but again the difference was not statistically significant (pâ€Š=â€Š0.25) (Figure 3D).  D. Effect on cell motility To investigate the effect of the expression of the above three c-CBL mutants on cell migration	 we carried out wound healing assay as described in materials and methods. The closing of the scratch or the wound was monitored at 0	12	24	36	 and 48 h. (Figure 4A). In all the samples	 that represented cells transfected with mutants	 the wound gap was much smaller than that seen in the sample that represented cells transfected with c-CBL WT (p<0.001). We also determined the rate of wound closure for all the five groups. At 48 h	 wild-type c-CBL transfectants showed 61.1% open wound while the S80N/H94Y	 Q249E and W802* mutants showed 18.7%	 23.9% and 34.3% open wound respectively (p<0.001) (Figure 4B).  Figure 4 Figure 4 c-CBL mutations affect wound healing in A549 cells. E. c-CBL knockdown increases cell viability It is hypothesized that the LOH seen in our samples could lead to decreased expression of c-CBL. Thus we tested the effect of c-CBL knockdown in lung cancer cells. Compared to A549	 H358 lung cancer cells express relatively high levels of endogenous c-CBL (data not shown). c-CBL expression was knocked down using lentiviral construct that expressed c-CBL specific shRNA and compared the results with those that were transduced with scrambled shRNA and the results are shown in Figure 5. We identified several clones that revealed varying degrees of c-CBL knockdown showing different sets of c-CBL lentiviral shRNA knockdown efficiency (Figure 5A). Of all the clones tested	 Clone 27 was chosen for further experiments. Equal amount of cells were seeded in a 6-well plate and the cell proliferation was measured at various times and the results are depicted in Figure 5B. As expected	 number of cells increased in a time dependent fashion from 100 to 190% relative to scrambled shRNA as control in a span of 48 h (pâ€Š=â€Š0.0002) (Figure 5B). The cell cycle phases in H358 cells that were knocked down with c-CBL shRNA were looked at and compared with the scrambled shRNA. There were no discernable differences between these two constructs in the different phases of the cell cycle (data not shown).  Figure 5 Figure 5 Knockdown of c-CBL using an shRNA increases cell proliferation. Go to: Discussion Our results demonstrate that c-CBL is somatically mutated (or has LOH) in lung cancers	 and can significantly contribute to enhanced cell viability and motility. There was also a high prevalence of LOH with respect to c-CBL in lung tumors that harbored MET or EGFR mutation.  In the present study	 we have demonstrated the occurrence of c-CBL mutations in lung cancer patients	 especially with different ancestral variations. Mutations in c-CBL have been recently reported in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and myeloid malignancies. In the AML study	 the mutation R420Q located in the junction of the RING finger and the linker region inhibited FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) internalization and ubiquitination [20]	 thus contributing to the gain-in-function for the RTK. In addition	 mutations such as H398Y	 C384R	 and L380P mapped to the RING finger domain and the linker region of c-CBL that is required for its E3 activity [23]	 [24]	 [25]	 [26]	 [27]. Additionally	 homozygous mutations in the RING finger domain of the c-CBL gene were described as a result of acquired Uniparental Disomy (UPD) [26]. It is important to note that our results indicate LOH at 11q23 locus and these are mutually exclusive from missense mutations of c-CBL. The somatic mutations were all heterozygous. The mutations in AML led to abrogation of the E3 activity leading to prolonged RTK activation. In addition mutants located on the linker region surrounding the RING finger domain exhibited enhanced AKT signaling in response to cytokine stimulation [26]. In addition	 it was shown in NH3T3 cells	 that neither mutations in the RING finger nor the linker region causes transformation	 however while certain mutations perturbs the ubiquitination	 others affect receptor recycling and prolong kinase activity [28].  We report here c-CBL mutations that mapped not only to the RING finger domain	 but also to the TKB domain	 proline-rich domain and the C-terminal region	 but none mapped to the linker region as reported in the AML studies described above [23]	 [24]	 [25]	 [26]	 [29]. In addition	 8 mutants that we detected were found in different ethnic backgrounds. For example	 S80N/H94Y	 Q249E	 W802* were detected in Caucasians	 Taiwanese and African-Americans	 respectively. The results point out not only the difference between lung cancer and other cancers	 but also genetic polymorphism among different races in the same cancer. Interestingly	 there is a large disparity between African-American and other ethnic populations with lung cancer [30]. We have previously shown that there was a low frequency of EGFR and MET mutation in African-Americans as compared with Taiwanese and Caucasians [31]. In this study	 the number of African-American samples analyzed was relatively fewer and we found 3 mutations that are unique to this ethnicity. It would now behoove us to further study the genetic alterations that can occur and determine the targeted therapeutics for African-Americans. Our results provide evidence of the importance of c-CBL in tumorigenesis and potential signaling. Our prediction	 based on the AML data	 would be that the V391I RING finger domain mutation would affect the E3 activity. Also	 it will be important to determine the binding partners for c-CBL in the TKB domain and proline rich domain mutations. It has previously been shown that the TKB domain can bind to growth factor receptors and it will be important to determine the cross-binding of these mutants to MET and or EGFR. It would also be important in the future to look at fluorescence in situ hybridization/copy number changes in c-CBL in lung cancer.  c-CBL plays an important role in down regulating RTK-mediated signaling through K63 poly-ubiquitination and subsequent downregulation of RTKs followed by lysosomal degredation [3]. Mono-ubiquitination or ubiquitinated with K63-linked chains of substrates by c-CBL may lead to enhancement of biological and biochemical functions (reviewed in Hermann et al	 2007 [32]). The mutations that we analyzed in our studies all point out to the fact that the E3 activity of c-CBL on EGFR is intact; the EGFR levels in the various mutants remain same (Figure S2). Multiple kinases	 both RTKs and non-RTKs could be acted upon by c-CBL	 including ERBs	 PDGFR	 FMS	 MET	 c-Kit	 VEGFR	 FLT-1	 RON	 FGFR	 IR	 as well as SYK	 FYN	 LCK	 FGR	 LYN and c-ABL [3]. In lung cancers the relevant substrates of c-CBL in terms of degradation or signal transduction are yet to be identified.  The observation that c-CBL somatic mutations	 especially S80N/H94Y	 Q249E and W802* showed increased cell viability and cell motility that is in agreement with the physiological role for D-cbl in the regulation of apoptosis and differentiation identified in Drosophila is very significant [33]. It has been previously shown that activating c-CBL mutation downregulates EGFR signaling and decreases cellular proliferation and migration in breast cancer cell lines [34]. Although the role of c-CBL in the negative regulation of RTKs is well substantiated	 thereby suggesting that it is a natural tumor suppressor	 studies in cancer cells have revealed both tumor suppressor and tumor promoting activities depending on the type of c-CBL mutation and the number of alleles at the c-CBL locus [24]. In agreement with the above	 the three c-CBL mutants described here appear to have tumor growth and metastasis promoting properties. Although these mutants are outside of the RING finger or the linker region of c-CBL	 their downstream effects are significant so as to cause increased proliferation and migration	 but the substrate affected by these mutations are not known yet. This raises the possibility that some of the cellular functions of c-CBL are independent of its ubiquitin-ligase activity	 an area that we are currently investigating. The oncogenic nature of RTKs	 addiction of cancers to growth signals and given the clustering of c-CBL	 EGFR and MET mutations	 it is possible that the transforming effect of c-CBL mutations is most likely a combinatorial effect of the three. We also show that LOH for c-CBL was found in a significant number of samples that harbored MET or EGFR mutations. The fact that about 7% of lung tumor samples are likely to have c-CBL mutations and an additional 22% are likely to harbor c-CBL-related LOH	 makes c-CBL a highly mutated molecule in lung cancer. Since LOH alone is not enough to cause a transforming event [35]	 [36]	 [37]	 associated mutation in the MET or EGFR locus or yet another RTK discussed above may play a role in carcinogenesis. We predict that this LOH in c-CBL results in haploinsufficiency that downplays RTK ubiquitination leading to hyperactivity of the RTKs. However	 whether this is sufficient cause for tumorigenesis remains to be determined. Consistent with our hypothesis is the fact that c-cbl-/- mice have increased kinase activity in lymphocytes	 but is not sufficient for tumor formation [35]	 [36]	 [37]. c-CBL LOH could also lead to increased expression of c-CBL from the other allele to compensate for a loss of an allele. Alternately	 there could be some form of synergy working with reduced c-CBL levels and mutated receptors that exacerbate the phenotype of each alone.  Previous studies from our lab and others have shown that East Asians with lung cancers have relatively high frequencies of gain-of-function of mutations in RTKs such as EGFR and MET [31]. In a cohort of Japanese patients an activating MET mutation was identified in the splice region that deletes the juxtamembrane domain that is involved E3 activity of c-CBL [38]. This study also found that activation of MET is mutually exclusive of EGFR	 KRAS and HER2 gene mutations [38]. We failed to detect such mutations in significant numbers in lung tumor samples obtained from African-Americans (nâ€Š=â€Š29) and Caucasian (nâ€Š=â€Š50) patients. One MET mutation was identified in each of the groups whereas 1 and 3 EGFR mutations were identified in the African-American and Caucasian cohorts respectively. EGFR mutations have earlier been identified as one of the key mutations affecting lung adenocarcinoma patients in a comprehensive study of 188 patients [39]. Our study encompasses different histologies of NSCLC. However	 the published series did not find any mutations in c-CBL or MET unlike our study that encompassed different subtypes of NSCLC. It is important to note	 we have recently shown that MET mutations in lung cancer are in majority germline [31]. We have reported earlier c-CBL mutations in a small cohort of Taiwanese lung cancer samples [40]. In our efforts to understand the ethnic differences in the lung oncogenome	 we also looked at PAX transcription factors such as PAX5 and PAX8 that are highly expressed in lung cancers; however there was no preferential expression or mutations of the above genes in lung tumor samples of African-Americans. In this study	 we show relatively high frequency of c-CBL mutations in lung cancers	 especially in the large cell type among Caucasians and particularly among African-Americans. We therefore propose c-CBL as an efficacious target for lung cancers in African-Americans that needs to be further substantiated. This is all the more important because the prognosis for African-Americans with lung cancer	 especially for men is much poorer compared to their Caucasian counterparts [41].  In conclusion	 the results presented in this study demonstrate that c-CBL is frequently mutated or even lost in lung cancers. Our results support a role for c-CBL mutants that are independent of its ubiquitination activity. Given the relatively high mutation rates in c-CBL as well as RTKs such as MET and EGFR	 it is likely that their combined effect could be synergistic in promoting tumorigenesis. 																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														
2	2|| Abstract Background  Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a heterogeneous group of disorders with a number of genetic and proteomic alterations. c-CBL is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and adaptor molecule important in normal homeostasis and cancer. We determined the genetic variations of c-CBL	 relationship to receptor tyrosine kinases (EGFR and MET)	 and functionality in NSCLC.  Methods and Findings  Using archival formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) extracted genomic DNA	 we show that c-CBL mutations occur in somatic fashion for lung cancers. c-CBL mutations were not mutually exclusive of MET or EGFR mutations; however they were independent of p53 and KRAS mutations. In normal/tumor pairwise analysis	 there was significant loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for the c-CBL locus (22%	 nâ€Š=â€Š8/37) and none of these samples revealed any mutation in the remaining copy of c-CBL. The c-CBL LOH also positively correlated with EGFR and MET mutations observed in the same samples. Using select c-CBL somatic mutations such as S80N/H94Y	 Q249E and W802* (obtained from Caucasian	 Taiwanese and African-American samples	 respectively) transfected in NSCLC cell lines	 there was increased cell viability and cell motility.  Conclusions  Taking the overall mutation rate of c-CBL to be a combination as somatic missense mutation and LOH	 it is clear that c-CBL is highly mutated in lung cancers and may play an essential role in lung tumorigenesis and metastasis.  Go to: Introduction In the US alone	 each year approximately 219	400 people are diagnosed with lung cancers	 out of which more than 145	000 of them succumb to the disease [1]. This number is roughly equivalent to the combined mortality rates of cancers of the breast	 prostate	 colon	 liver	 kidney and melanoma [1]. In addition the prognosis is usually poor and the five-year survival rate is less than 15%. There are also significant ethnic differences for lung cancer	 and the outcome is worse for blacks compared to whites. Gender differences are also striking with women having significantly better prognosis as compared to men. There are a number of genetic alterations that can occur in lung cancer. As an example	 in NSCLC	 mutations in KRAS	 p53	 EGFR and MET have been identified. Many of these pathways	 especially Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) are controlled by c-CBL.  CBL (Casitas B-lineage lymphoma) is a mammalian gene located on human chromosome 11q23.3 [2] and is involved in cell signaling and protein ubiquitination [3]. CBL proteins belong to the RING finger class of ubiquitin ligases (E3) and there are three homologues c-CBL	 CBL-b	 CBL-3 [4]. The c-CBL and CBL-b genes are ubiquitously expressed with the highest levels in hematopoietic tissues [5]. c-CBL consists of four regions encoding for functionally distinct protein domains: the N-terminal tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain	 the linker region	 the catalytic RING finger domain	 the proline-rich region and the c-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain that also overlaps with a leucine-zipper (LZ) domain [3]. Both TKB and RING finger domains are essential for ligand-induced ubiquitination of RTKs [6]	 [7]	 [8]	 [9]. The RING finger domain is required for the recruitment of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. The TKB domain includes four-helix bundle (4H)	 a calcium-biding EF hand	 and a modified SH2 domain	 which binds to phosphotyrosine residues [3]	 [10]	 [11]	 [12]. In addition	 the proline-rich region of c-CBL can associate with the SH3 domain of Grb2	 which can indirectly recruit c-CBL to RTKs via the GRB2 adaptor protein [7]	 [13]	 [14].  c-CBL also binds to EGFR and acts as the E3 that targets EGFR for ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore	 CBL desensitizes EGF signaling and opposes cellular proliferation induced by EGF [15]. EGF activation also appears to activate the tyrosine kinase SRC	 which phosphorylates c-CBL and in turn activates the ubiquitination and degradation of EGFR [16]	 [17]	 [18]. A recent study shows that defective endocytosis of EGFR is characterized by a deletion mutant and the point mutation L858R	 whereby its association with c-CBL and subsequent ubiquitination are impaired [19]. Recently	 the first human c-CBL mutations were reported in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients [20]. The mutation R420Q inhibits FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) internalization and ubiquitination [20].  Not only can E3 activity be important in oncogenesis	 c-CBL has a dual but separate function as a signal transduction molecule. We have previously shown that c-CBL is important in binding CRKL and BCR/ABL in hematopoietic cells. Also	 it can bind and modulate functions of cytoskeleton by binding to proteins like talin and paxillin. The TKB domain is important in binding to a number of molecules	 and they then function in signal transduction.  Given the critical role of CBL in normal homeostasis and cancer	 we hypothesized that it might be mutated in lung cancers. In this study	 we report novel c-CBL somatic mutations S80N/H94Y	 Q249E and W802* in Caucasian	 Taiwanese and African-American lung cancer patients	 respectively. Expressing these mutations in NSCLC cell lines lead to increased proliferation and cell motility. We show that c-CBL mutations occur with or without MET or EGFR mutations but are mutually exclusive of a LOH at the c-CBL locus. Additionally	 c-CBL LOH is associated with either MET or EGFR mutations. We thus hypothesize that c-CBL mutations might contribute to the oncogenic potential of MET and EGFR in lung cancer.  Go to: Methods Ethics Statement  Written consent on all research on human subjects has been obtained from the Institutional Review Board	 University of Chicago and covers all research performed in the laboratory. The following is their contact information: Institutional Review Board	 The University of Chicago	 McGiffert Hall	 5751 S. Woodlawn Ave.	 2nd floor	 Chicago	 IL 60637. Written informed consents were received from all patients whose tissue samples were used for this study.  Tissue Samples  Lung cancer tissue and paired adjacent normal lung tissues were obtained from 50 Caucasian	 29 African-Americans and 40 Taiwanese NSCLC patients who were recruited at the University of Chicago Hospital (Chicago	 USA) (Caucasian and African-American patients) and Taipei Veterans General Hospital of Taiwan (Taiwanese patients) after obtaining appropriate Institutional Review Board permission and informed consent from the patients. Out of 119 samples	 77 were men	 38 were women and 4 were unknown with age at diagnosis ranging from 47 to 90 years. In terms of tumor types	 53 were adenocarcinoma	 32 were squamous cell carcinoma and 34 were large cell carcinoma. 49 were stage I	 14 were stage II	 34 were stage III	 and 13 were stage IV (Table S1).  Cell Culture  Human non-small cell lung carcinoma cells A549 and H358 were maintained in DMEM and RPMI-1640	 respectively. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were cultured in DMEM. Media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum	 100 units/ml of penicillin	 and 100 Âµg/ml of streptomycin (Invitrogen	 Carlsbad	 CA). Cells were cultured at 37Â°C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2.  c-CBL Gene Mutational Analysis  Exons 2 to 16 of c-CBL gene were individually amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Primers are listed in Table S2. PCR conditions were 1 cycle of 95Â°C for 5 minutes; 35 cycles of 94Â°C for 30 seconds	 58Â°C for 30 seconds and 72Â°C for 2 minutes; and one cycle of 72Â°C for 10 minutes. PCR products were treated with ExoSAP-IT (USB Corporation	 Cleveland	 OH) and sequenced by Big-Dye Terminator Chemistry (Applied Biosystems	 Foster City	 CA). Sequencing was performed on the forward coding strand with confirmation of c-CBL alterations performed by sequencing the reverse strand as well. Chromatograms were analyzed for mutations using Mutation Surveyor v2.61 (Softgenetics	 State College	 PA).  Plasmid Constructs and Site-Directed Mutagenesis  The wild-type c-CBL cDNA insert was subcloned into the pAlterMax expression vector using XhoI and SalI restriction enzyme sites (Promega	 Madison	 WI). Using this parental plasmid pAlterMax-c-CBL	 the TKB domain double mutation (S80N/H94Y)	 the point mutation (Q249E)	 and the C-terminal point mutation W802* of c-CBL were created using the following primers: 5â€²-GCTGGCGCTAAAGAATAACCCACCTTATATCTTAGAC-3â€² and 5â€²-CTACCAGATACCTACCAGTATCTCCGTACTATCTTGTC-3â€² for the double mutation S80N/H94Y; 5â€²-CTTTACCCGACTCTTTGAGCCCTGGTCCTCTTTGC-3â€² for Q249E	 and 5â€²-CAGCTCCTCCTTTGGCTGATTGTCTCTGGATGGTGATC-3â€² for W802* along with their complementary primers using the QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis XL kit (Stratagene	 La Jolla	 CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The constructs were confirmed for the point mutations by standard DNA sequencing of both strands.  Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) Analysis  Five microsatellites on chromosome 11 (3 on 11q at or within 200 kb up or downstream of the c-CBL gene and 2 control markers on 11p) were selected for analysis (Table S3). Established microsatellite markers and respective primer sequences were selected from the GeneLoc database (http://genecards.weizmann.ac.il/geneloc/index.shtml	 Weizmann Institute of Science	 Rehovot	 Israel). Primers were custom designed and each forward primer was fluorescently labeled at the 5â€² end with FAM	 PET	 NED	 or VIC (Applied Biosystems). Primer annealing temperatures and duplex scores were evaluated with NIST Primer Tools (http://yellow.nist.gov:8444/dnaAnalysis/primerToolsPage.do; National Institute of Standards and Technology	 Gaithersburg	 MD). Primers were verified by performing PCR with control DNA (isolated from TK6 cells) and resolving the products on agarose gels. Bands were visualized with an UV transilluminator. Genomic DNA was extracted from tumor samples and paired normal lung tissue. Primers were grouped into multiplex combinations shown in Table S4. Marker D11S929 served as an internal control to check for consistency in PCRs and of peaks from capillary electrophoresis. Multiplex PCRs were carried out in a volume of 10 ÂµL that contained 1 ÂµL genomic DNA (20â€“50 ng)	 0.5 ÂµM of each primer (1.0 ÂµM total for each primer pair)	 400 ÂµM dNTPs	 1X PCR buffer containing MgCl2	 and 0.2 U Taq DNA polymerase. PCR was performed on the ABI GeneAmp 9700 PCR System under the following conditions: 5 min at 94Â°C; 30 cycles of 30 sec at 94Â°C	 1 min at 60Â°C	 1 min at 72Â°C; and 5 min at 72Â°C. The PCR products were separated by capillary electrophoresis on an ABI 3130XL DNA Analyzer. Chromatograms were analyzed with Peak Scanner 1.0 and GeneMapper 3.7 software (Applied Biosystems) for allelic alterations. The area of the peaks produced by the DNA PCR products was quantified for each allele. The ratio of the allelic areas was calculated for each tumor and paired normal DNA sample. When the qLOH (allelic ratio for the tumor peaks divided by the allelic ratio of paired normal sample) was â‰¤0.5 or â‰¥2.0 for c-CBL and at least one other 11q marker in at least two separate experiments	 the sample was considered as having an allelic imbalance and interpreted as LOH. Samples were evaluated in at least two separate experiments and samples showing prospective LOH at c-CBL repeated a third time which included a new control marker at the BAX locus (data not shown) on chromosome 19 to verify integrity of sample DNA.  Transfection of c-Cbl Constructs  The A549 cell line was transfected using the Fugene HD (Roche	 Nutley	 NJ) reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Eight Âµg of plasmid DNA	 containing either no insert (empty vector)	 wild-type c-CBL	 S80N/H94Y c-CBL	 Q249E c-CBL or W802* CBL was used for transfection in a 6-well culture plate. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and analyzed for expression.  c-CBL Knockdown  c-CBL knockdown was performed using lentiviral transduction using MISSION lentiviral transduction particles (Sigma-Aldrich	 St. Louis	 MO) as per manufacturer's instructions. Briefly	 1Ã—105 H358 cells/well were seeded in 6-well plates and infected the following day with c-CBL lentiviral shRNA constructs. To generate stable c-CBL knockdown cell lines	 cells were selected for 2 days with 1 Âµg/ml puromycin. c-CBL levels were determined using whole cell lysates by immunoblotting with anti-CBL antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies	 Santa Cruz	 CA).  Cell Viability Assay  Cells were transfected as described above in the transfection assay. Forty-eight hours after transfection	 viability of cells was assessed using Trypan Blue exclusion.  Wound Healing Assay  A549 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and cultured for 48 h until 100% confluent. The medium was then changed and the cells were transfected as described in the transfection assay. Twelve hours after transfection	 a straight scratch was made across the cell layer using a 1 ml pipette tip. The cells were then gently washed with 1Ã— PBS to remove cellular debris and the media was replaced. Photographs were taken of the wound region every 12 h until 48 h.  Western Blot Analysis  Forty eight hours after transfection	 cells were collected and washed twice in 1X PBS	 then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (0.5M Tris-HCl with pH 7.4	 1.5 M NaCl	 2.5% deoxycholic acid	 10 mM EDTA	 10% NP-40	 0.5 mM DTT	 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride	 5 Âµg/mL leupeptin	 and 10 Âµg/mL aprotinin) for 5 minutes. The lysate was centrifuged at 13	000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4Â°C	 and protein content of the supernatant was measured. Total cell lysates (50 Âµg/well) were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and the gels transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman	 Piscataway	 NJ). Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing Tween-20 (PBST) (1X PBS	 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with the appropriate primary antibody at 4Â°C overnight. Membranes then were washed three times with PBST and probed with appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were again washed three times in PBST and bands were visualized using Western blot chemiluminescence reagent (BioRad	 Valencia	 CA) on a Chemidoc Gel documentation system (BioRad	 Valencia	 CA). Antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies and used at the following dilutions (c-CBL	 1âˆ¶5000; c-MET	 1âˆ¶5000; EGFR	 1âˆ¶5000; ubiquitin	 1âˆ¶1000; HA	 1âˆ¶5000 and Î²-actin	 1âˆ¶10	000).  Flow Cytometry  Cell cycle analysis was carried out by flow cytometry. Approximately 2Ã—106 cells were grown in media containing 10% FBS. Cells were harvested by trypsin/EDTA treatment	 washed with 1X PBS three times and fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol for 2 h. Cells were washed again with cold PBS and stained with a solution containing 25 Âµg/mL propidium iodide	 200 Âµg/mL RNase A	 and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 minutes in the dark. Cell cycle analysis was performed using a Guava PCA-96 flow cytometer (Guava Technologies	 Millipore	 Billerica	 MA).  Ubiquitin Ligase Activity  293T cells were maintained in culture in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin (100 units/mL) and streptomycin (100 Âµg/mL) were transfected with 0.2 Âµg EGFR-pcDNA3 and 2 Âµg HA-tagged c-CBL constructs as indicated using calcium phosphate according to manufacturer's protocol (Profection	 Promega	 Madison	 WI). Twenty-four hours post-transfection	 cells were starved overnight in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS	 and then treated with or without EGF (100 ng/ml) for 15 min. The cells were collected and washed two times in ice-cold PBS containing 0.2 mM sodium orthovanadate then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris HCl	 pH 7.5	 150 mM NaCl	 5 mM EDTA	 1% Triton X100	 10% Glycerol	 2 mM sodium orthovanadate and protease inhibitors). Lysates were cleared of debris by centrifugation at 16	000 g for 10 min at 4Â°C. EGFR immunoprecipitations were performed on 200 Âµg of cleared lysate using 250 ng of rabbit-anti-EGFR and Protein A/G Plus Sepharose overnight at 4Â°C. Precipitations were washed 5 times in lysis buffer before boiling in Laemmli buffer. Elutions were immunoblotted with anti-ubiquitin and EGFR. Twenty micrograms of cleared lysate were immunoblotted for each of the c-CBL constructs using anti-HA.  Statistical Analysis  Mutation rates between different groups were compared using Fisher's exact test. For continuous variables	 group comparisons were performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Sidak's adjustment for multiple comparisons. Experiments involving repeated measurements over time were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA with the Greenhouse-Geisser adjustment to the degrees of freedom. Analyses were conducted using STATA (v10.1) software (Stata Corporation	 College Station	 TX).  Go to: Results c-CBL Gene Mutations in Lung Cancer  To investigate the role of c-CBL in lung cancer	 we analyzed its genomic DNA in tumor and paired normal samples drawn from multiple ethnicities. The lung tumor samples represented Caucasians (nâ€Š=â€Š50)	 African-Americans (nâ€Š=â€Š29)	 and Taiwanese (nâ€Š=â€Š40) lung cancer patients. We designed 12 pairs of primers to sequence the coding region of c-CBL gene that spans exons 2 to 16 (Table S2). We identified 8 unique somatic mutations in c-CBL exons among 8 different patients. A variation L620F	 a known SNP (rs2227988) in exon 11 was also detected. Importantly	 the eight novel non-synonymous mutations were confirmed by sequencing both strands of c-CBL genomic DNA obtained from lung tumor samples (Table 1). Moreover	 none of the 8 mutations were detected in the corresponding normal tissue	 indicating that these were somatic mutations. Four synonymous single nucleotide variations (SNVs) were also identified but were not used further in this study.  Table 1 Table 1 c-CBL mutation analysis in 119 lung cancer patient tumor tissues. Three of the 8 novel non-synonymous mutations were located in the TKB (tyrosine kinase binding) domain (S80N	 H94Y	 and Q249E)	 one in the RING finger domain (V391I)	 one in the proline-rich region (72515_72517 del ATG)	 and three in the C-terminal region (W802*	 R830K	 and A848T) of the c-CBL protein (Figure 1A and Figure S1). In Figure 1B	 we show model chromatograms of representative samples.  Figure 1 Figure 1 c-CBL mutations and LOH in non-small cell lung cancer. 11q LOH of c-CBL Gene  Paired lung tumor and normal lung tissue samples from Taiwanese patients (nâ€Š=â€Š37) were investigated for LOH. Eight (21.6%) showed LOH at the c-CBL locus on chromosome 11 while 29 samples (78.4%) revealed normal allelic contribution at the microsatellite markers (Figures 1C and D).  c-CBL Mutations in Different Ethnic Groups  The c-CBL double mutant S80N/H94Y was found in the same patient and the overall mutation rate for c-CBL in lung tumors was 6.7% (8/119). The frequency of c-CBL mutation was highest in large cell carcinoma (14.7%; 5 of 34 patients) followed by squamous carcinoma (6.3%; 2 of 32 patients) and the least was observed in adenocarcinoma (AD) (1.8%; 1 of 53 patients)	 although these rates were not statistically significant (pâ€Š=â€Š0.292). Mutation rates were 6.0% among Caucasians (0 of 20 in AD; 0 of 10 in SQ; and 3 of 20 in LC)	 13.8% in African-Americans (1 of 10 in AD; 1 of 10 in SQ; and 2 of 9 in LC)	 and 2.5% (0 of 23 in AD; 1 of 12 in SQ; and 0 of 5 in LC) in the Taiwanese population. Additionally two Taiwanese patients with lung cancer (one squamous and one adenocarcinoma) had the known SNP L620F. Ethnic differences were not statistically significant	 however the power to detect differences was low.  Mutations in MET and EGFR Can Be Co-Associated with c-CBL Alterations  Since East Asians with lung cancer have a higher frequency of EGFR and MET mutations in lung tumors [21]	 [22]	 we also determined mutations in EGFR and MET in the same Taiwanese cohort samples and compared the results with the observed c-CBL alterations (LOH and/or mutations). In the 37 samples tested	 we did not find any overlap between c-CBL mutations and c-CBL LOH (Figure 2). Of the three c-CBL mutants (including the known L620F SNP	 rs2227988)	 one of the samples had a MET mutation (N375S) and the other had an EGFR mutation (L858R). Among the 8 samples that had a LOH at the c-CBL locus 5 had an additional mutation in MET (N375S) and 2 had an EGFR exon 19 deletion. Twenty-six samples had neither c-CBL mutation nor c-CBL LOH (3 patients had a c-CBL mutation but no c-CBL LOH). Among these 26 samples 9 had a MET mutation (8 N375S	 1 L211W)	 13 had an EGFR mutation (7 exon 9 deletion	 6 L858R) and 4 had no other MET or EGFR mutation. Thus the rate of MET or EGFR mutations among patients with LOH at the c-CBL locus (7 of 8) was similar to that seen in patients without c-CBL mutation or LOH (22 of 26 patients) (pâ€Š=â€Š0.99). These 4 patients with no identifiable mutation in c-CBL	 MET or EGFR represented 10.8% of the 37 patients analyzed in the Taiwanese patient cohort. Conversely	 89.2% Taiwanese lung cancer patients have an identifiable mutation in either c-CBL	 MET or EGFR or a combination of the three genes (Figure 2). Additionally	 we determined p53 and KRAS mutations in these Taiwanese cohorts. Two p53 and 1 KRAS mutation were detected. The single KRAS mutation overlapped with one p53 mutation. This patient also had the EGFR exon 19 deletion but had no c-CBL mutation. The other p53 mutation sample had a c-CBL LOH with concurrent MET N375S mutation. Thus	 in the Taiwanese samples analyzed	 p53/KRAS mutations and c-CBL mutations were mutually exclusive (data not shown).  Figure 2 Figure 2 c-CBL mutations and relationship to MET and EGFR mutations in lung cancer. Cellular Functions of c-CBL Alterations in the Context of Lung Tumorigenesis  A. E3 activity is intact in the mutant c-CBL proteins To investigate whether the different c-CBL mutations affect the E3 activity	 EGFR was chosen as a model substrate for c-CBL E3 function. All of the c-CBL mutants tested enhanced ubiquitination of the activated EGFR similar to the wild-type c-CBL protein. This result demonstrates that the catalytic activity of the c-CBL mutants is not impaired when EGFR was the substrate. (Figure 3A).  Figure 3 Figure 3 Ubiquitination	 viability	 expression and cell cycle analysis of various c-CBL mutants. B. Effect on lung cancer cell viability The effect of a representative c-CBL mutant from each of the three ethnic backgrounds on lung cancer cell viability in cell lines was determined. S80N/H94Y double mutation	 Q249E	 and W802* were identified in lung tumor samples obtained from a Caucasian	 a Taiwanese and an African-American	 respectively. As described in methods	 the c-CBL wild-type (WT) and the above three mutants were expressed after cloning them into pAlterMax vector in A549 cells. These cells express relatively low basal levels of endogenous c-CBL (data not shown). Transfection efficiency was comparable between different groups and the number of cells transfected with c-CBL wild-type construct was about 70% compared to control cells that were transfected with the empty vector. Cells transfected with S80N/H94Y	 Q249E and W802* c-CBL mutant constructs resulted in increased number of viable cells that was 132.3%	 120.8% and 147.9% higher respectively	 relative to the empty vector control transfected cells and significantly different from the wild-type construct (pâ€Š=â€Š0.022	 pâ€Š=â€Š0.049	 and pâ€Š=â€Š0.008	 respectively) (Figure 3B). Relative levels of c-CBL protein in whole cell lysates prepared from samples obtained from a parallel experiment was determined. The c-CBL protein levels in samples representing untransfected and empty vector transfected cells were comparable and those representing the c-CBL WT and the three c-CBL mutants were comparable (Figure 3C).  C. Effect on cell cycle To investigate if the increases in cell viability in different c-CBL mutants are due to increased cellular proliferation	 a cell cycle analysis was performed. A549 cells were transfected with the c-CBL WT or the three different mutants: S80N/H94Y	 Q249E and W802*. The empty vector transfectant was used as a control. Forty-eight hours after transfection cell cycle analysis was performed as described in materials and methods. There was no significant change in the subG1	 G1 or the S phase of the cell cycle among the different mutants compared to the WT construct (pâ€Š=â€Š0.64	 pâ€Š=â€Š0.40	 and pâ€Š=â€Š0.28	 respectively). The G2/M phase of the cell cycle showed an increase in cell numbers for the three mutants	 S80N/H94Y	 Q249E and W802*	 when compared to the WT but again the difference was not statistically significant (pâ€Š=â€Š0.25) (Figure 3D).  D. Effect on cell motility To investigate the effect of the expression of the above three c-CBL mutants on cell migration	 we carried out wound healing assay as described in materials and methods. The closing of the scratch or the wound was monitored at 0	12	24	36	 and 48 h. (Figure 4A). In all the samples	 that represented cells transfected with mutants	 the wound gap was much smaller than that seen in the sample that represented cells transfected with c-CBL WT (p<0.001). We also determined the rate of wound closure for all the five groups. At 48 h	 wild-type c-CBL transfectants showed 61.1% open wound while the S80N/H94Y	 Q249E and W802* mutants showed 18.7%	 23.9% and 34.3% open wound respectively (p<0.001) (Figure 4B).  Figure 4 Figure 4 c-CBL mutations affect wound healing in A549 cells. E. c-CBL knockdown increases cell viability It is hypothesized that the LOH seen in our samples could lead to decreased expression of c-CBL. Thus we tested the effect of c-CBL knockdown in lung cancer cells. Compared to A549	 H358 lung cancer cells express relatively high levels of endogenous c-CBL (data not shown). c-CBL expression was knocked down using lentiviral construct that expressed c-CBL specific shRNA and compared the results with those that were transduced with scrambled shRNA and the results are shown in Figure 5. We identified several clones that revealed varying degrees of c-CBL knockdown showing different sets of c-CBL lentiviral shRNA knockdown efficiency (Figure 5A). Of all the clones tested	 Clone 27 was chosen for further experiments. Equal amount of cells were seeded in a 6-well plate and the cell proliferation was measured at various times and the results are depicted in Figure 5B. As expected	 number of cells increased in a time dependent fashion from 100 to 190% relative to scrambled shRNA as control in a span of 48 h (pâ€Š=â€Š0.0002) (Figure 5B). The cell cycle phases in H358 cells that were knocked down with c-CBL shRNA were looked at and compared with the scrambled shRNA. There were no discernable differences between these two constructs in the different phases of the cell cycle (data not shown).  Figure 5 Figure 5 Knockdown of c-CBL using an shRNA increases cell proliferation. Go to: Discussion Our results demonstrate that c-CBL is somatically mutated (or has LOH) in lung cancers	 and can significantly contribute to enhanced cell viability and motility. There was also a high prevalence of LOH with respect to c-CBL in lung tumors that harbored MET or EGFR mutation.  In the present study	 we have demonstrated the occurrence of c-CBL mutations in lung cancer patients	 especially with different ancestral variations. Mutations in c-CBL have been recently reported in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and myeloid malignancies. In the AML study	 the mutation R420Q located in the junction of the RING finger and the linker region inhibited FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) internalization and ubiquitination [20]	 thus contributing to the gain-in-function for the RTK. In addition	 mutations such as H398Y	 C384R	 and L380P mapped to the RING finger domain and the linker region of c-CBL that is required for its E3 activity [23]	 [24]	 [25]	 [26]	 [27]. Additionally	 homozygous mutations in the RING finger domain of the c-CBL gene were described as a result of acquired Uniparental Disomy (UPD) [26]. It is important to note that our results indicate LOH at 11q23 locus and these are mutually exclusive from missense mutations of c-CBL. The somatic mutations were all heterozygous. The mutations in AML led to abrogation of the E3 activity leading to prolonged RTK activation. In addition mutants located on the linker region surrounding the RING finger domain exhibited enhanced AKT signaling in response to cytokine stimulation [26]. In addition	 it was shown in NH3T3 cells	 that neither mutations in the RING finger nor the linker region causes transformation	 however while certain mutations perturbs the ubiquitination	 others affect receptor recycling and prolong kinase activity [28].  We report here c-CBL mutations that mapped not only to the RING finger domain	 but also to the TKB domain	 proline-rich domain and the C-terminal region	 but none mapped to the linker region as reported in the AML studies described above [23]	 [24]	 [25]	 [26]	 [29]. In addition	 8 mutants that we detected were found in different ethnic backgrounds. For example	 S80N/H94Y	 Q249E	 W802* were detected in Caucasians	 Taiwanese and African-Americans	 respectively. The results point out not only the difference between lung cancer and other cancers	 but also genetic polymorphism among different races in the same cancer. Interestingly	 there is a large disparity between African-American and other ethnic populations with lung cancer [30]. We have previously shown that there was a low frequency of EGFR and MET mutation in African-Americans as compared with Taiwanese and Caucasians [31]. In this study	 the number of African-American samples analyzed was relatively fewer and we found 3 mutations that are unique to this ethnicity. It would now behoove us to further study the genetic alterations that can occur and determine the targeted therapeutics for African-Americans. Our results provide evidence of the importance of c-CBL in tumorigenesis and potential signaling. Our prediction	 based on the AML data	 would be that the V391I RING finger domain mutation would affect the E3 activity. Also	 it will be important to determine the binding partners for c-CBL in the TKB domain and proline rich domain mutations. It has previously been shown that the TKB domain can bind to growth factor receptors and it will be important to determine the cross-binding of these mutants to MET and or EGFR. It would also be important in the future to look at fluorescence in situ hybridization/copy number changes in c-CBL in lung cancer.  c-CBL plays an important role in down regulating RTK-mediated signaling through K63 poly-ubiquitination and subsequent downregulation of RTKs followed by lysosomal degredation [3]. Mono-ubiquitination or ubiquitinated with K63-linked chains of substrates by c-CBL may lead to enhancement of biological and biochemical functions (reviewed in Hermann et al	 2007 [32]). The mutations that we analyzed in our studies all point out to the fact that the E3 activity of c-CBL on EGFR is intact; the EGFR levels in the various mutants remain same (Figure S2). Multiple kinases	 both RTKs and non-RTKs could be acted upon by c-CBL	 including ERBs	 PDGFR	 FMS	 MET	 c-Kit	 VEGFR	 FLT-1	 RON	 FGFR	 IR	 as well as SYK	 FYN	 LCK	 FGR	 LYN and c-ABL [3]. In lung cancers the relevant substrates of c-CBL in terms of degradation or signal transduction are yet to be identified.  The observation that c-CBL somatic mutations	 especially S80N/H94Y	 Q249E and W802* showed increased cell viability and cell motility that is in agreement with the physiological role for D-cbl in the regulation of apoptosis and differentiation identified in Drosophila is very significant [33]. It has been previously shown that activating c-CBL mutation downregulates EGFR signaling and decreases cellular proliferation and migration in breast cancer cell lines [34]. Although the role of c-CBL in the negative regulation of RTKs is well substantiated	 thereby suggesting that it is a natural tumor suppressor	 studies in cancer cells have revealed both tumor suppressor and tumor promoting activities depending on the type of c-CBL mutation and the number of alleles at the c-CBL locus [24]. In agreement with the above	 the three c-CBL mutants described here appear to have tumor growth and metastasis promoting properties. Although these mutants are outside of the RING finger or the linker region of c-CBL	 their downstream effects are significant so as to cause increased proliferation and migration	 but the substrate affected by these mutations are not known yet. This raises the possibility that some of the cellular functions of c-CBL are independent of its ubiquitin-ligase activity	 an area that we are currently investigating. The oncogenic nature of RTKs	 addiction of cancers to growth signals and given the clustering of c-CBL	 EGFR and MET mutations	 it is possible that the transforming effect of c-CBL mutations is most likely a combinatorial effect of the three. We also show that LOH for c-CBL was found in a significant number of samples that harbored MET or EGFR mutations. The fact that about 7% of lung tumor samples are likely to have c-CBL mutations and an additional 22% are likely to harbor c-CBL-related LOH	 makes c-CBL a highly mutated molecule in lung cancer. Since LOH alone is not enough to cause a transforming event [35]	 [36]	 [37]	 associated mutation in the MET or EGFR locus or yet another RTK discussed above may play a role in carcinogenesis. We predict that this LOH in c-CBL results in haploinsufficiency that downplays RTK ubiquitination leading to hyperactivity of the RTKs. However	 whether this is sufficient cause for tumorigenesis remains to be determined. Consistent with our hypothesis is the fact that c-cbl-/- mice have increased kinase activity in lymphocytes	 but is not sufficient for tumor formation [35]	 [36]	 [37]. c-CBL LOH could also lead to increased expression of c-CBL from the other allele to compensate for a loss of an allele. Alternately	 there could be some form of synergy working with reduced c-CBL levels and mutated receptors that exacerbate the phenotype of each alone.  Previous studies from our lab and others have shown that East Asians with lung cancers have relatively high frequencies of gain-of-function of mutations in RTKs such as EGFR and MET [31]. In a cohort of Japanese patients an activating MET mutation was identified in the splice region that deletes the juxtamembrane domain that is involved E3 activity of c-CBL [38]. This study also found that activation of MET is mutually exclusive of EGFR	 KRAS and HER2 gene mutations [38]. We failed to detect such mutations in significant numbers in lung tumor samples obtained from African-Americans (nâ€Š=â€Š29) and Caucasian (nâ€Š=â€Š50) patients. One MET mutation was identified in each of the groups whereas 1 and 3 EGFR mutations were identified in the African-American and Caucasian cohorts respectively. EGFR mutations have earlier been identified as one of the key mutations affecting lung adenocarcinoma patients in a comprehensive study of 188 patients [39]. Our study encompasses different histologies of NSCLC. However	 the published series did not find any mutations in c-CBL or MET unlike our study that encompassed different subtypes of NSCLC. It is important to note	 we have recently shown that MET mutations in lung cancer are in majority germline [31]. We have reported earlier c-CBL mutations in a small cohort of Taiwanese lung cancer samples [40]. In our efforts to understand the ethnic differences in the lung oncogenome	 we also looked at PAX transcription factors such as PAX5 and PAX8 that are highly expressed in lung cancers; however there was no preferential expression or mutations of the above genes in lung tumor samples of African-Americans. In this study	 we show relatively high frequency of c-CBL mutations in lung cancers	 especially in the large cell type among Caucasians and particularly among African-Americans. We therefore propose c-CBL as an efficacious target for lung cancers in African-Americans that needs to be further substantiated. This is all the more important because the prognosis for African-Americans with lung cancer	 especially for men is much poorer compared to their Caucasian counterparts [41].  In conclusion	 the results presented in this study demonstrate that c-CBL is frequently mutated or even lost in lung cancers. Our results support a role for c-CBL mutants that are independent of its ubiquitination activity. Given the relatively high mutation rates in c-CBL as well as RTKs such as MET and EGFR	 it is likely that their combined effect could be synergistic in promoting tumorigenesis. 																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														
3	3||Recent evidence has demonstrated that acquired uniparental disomy (aUPD) is a novel mechanism by which pathogenetic mutations in cancer may be reduced to homozygosity. To help identify novel mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs)	 we performed a genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) screen to identify aUPD in 58 patients with atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML; n = 30)	 JAK2 mutationâ€“negative myelofibrosis (MF; n = 18)	 or JAK2 mutationâ€“negative polycythemia vera (PV; n = 10). Stretches of homozygous	 copy neutral SNP calls greater than 20Mb were seen in 10 (33%) aCML and 1 (6%) MF	 but were absent in PV. In total	 7 different chromosomes were involved with 7q and 11q each affected in 10% of aCML cases. CBL mutations were identified in all 3 cases with 11q aUPD and analysis of 574 additional MPNs revealed a total of 27 CBL variants in 26 patients with aCML	 myelofibrosis or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Most variants were missense substitutions in the RING or linker domains that abrogated CBL ubiquitin ligase activity and conferred a proliferative advantage to 32D cells overexpressing FLT3. We conclude that acquired	 transforming CBL mutations are a novel and widespread pathogenetic abnormality in morphologically related	 clinically aggressive MPNs.  Introduction  Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by overproliferation of one or more myeloid cell lineages in the bone marrow and increased numbers of mature and immature myeloid cells in the peripheral blood. Excess proliferation is frequently associated with splenomegaly and cardiovascular complications as well as increased risk of transformation to acute leukemia. MPNs are categorized into subtypes based on specific morphologic	 hematologic	 and laboratory parameters	 the best characterized being the 4 so-called classic MPNs: polycythemia vera (PV)	 essential thrombocythemia (ET)	 primary myelofibrosis (MF)	 and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).1 In addition	 several atypical MPNs are recognized	 some of which show both dysplastic and proliferative features	 such as atypical	 BCR-ABL negative CML (aCML).2  MPNs are associated with acquired	 activating mutations or gene fusions of tyrosine kinases	 abnormalities that are believed to be critical drivers of excess proliferation as a result of deregulated or constitutive signaling.3 The 2 most prominent examples are BCR-ABL in CML4 and the V617F JAK2 mutation in PV	 ET	 and MF	5â‡“â‡“â€“8 but more than 40 variant tyrosine kinase fusions have been identified in MPNs as well as other mutations in JAK2 and FLT3.2 Activating mutations have been described in components that signal upstream (eg	 MPL) or downstream (eg	 NRAS) of tyrosine kinases9	10; however	 the molecular pathogenesis of the majority of atypical MPNs and approximately 50% of ET and MF cases remains obscure.  V617F JAK2 was initially identified by several different routes	 one of which was based on the observation that many PV patients show evidence of acquired uniparental disomy (aUPD) at chromosome 9p.11	12 Regions of aUPD exhibit loss of heterozygosity (LOH) compared with constitutional DNA without change of copy number and arise by mitotic recombination followed by selection for one of the products. After the initial observations in PV	 it has emerged that aUPD is common in both hematologic and epithelial malignancies	 and is associated with known oncogenic changes in a variety of genes within the affected regions.13 In this study we set out to determine whether aUPD characterizes MPNs of unknown molecular etiology and	 if so	 whether it could be used as a tool to help identify novel driver mutations.  Methods  Patients  Peripheral blood or bone marrow samples were received from patients diagnosed with an MPN or other hematologic malignancy according to standard morphologic	 hematologic	 and laboratory criteria. Clinical data were available from a subset of these cases. The study was approved by the Internal Review Boards from participating institutions and informed consent was obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.  SNP array analysis  DNA labeling and hybridization to Affymetrix 50k XbaI chips was performed at the Deutsches Ressourcenzentrum fÃ¼r Genomforschung (RZPD	 Berlin	 Germany). Raw data were imported into the Affymetrix GeneChip Operating Software	 analyzed using Affymetrix (High Wycombe	 United Kingdom) GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE 4.1) and copy number analysis tool (CNAT). Data were exported to custom-designed spreadsheets that display loss of heterozygosity and copy number changes in ideogram format. Data were also analyzed using Affymetrix Genotyping Console (version 2.1). Overall	 a median of 98.2% (range	 91.5%-99.6%) of SNPs gave readable calls.  Mutation analysis  Detection of mutations by high resolution melting (HRM) analysis was performed as described14 using a Rotor-Gene 6000 (Corbett Life Sciences	 St Neots	 United Kingdom). Direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products was performed by standard techniques on an ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems	 Warrington	 United Kingdom) and analyzed using Mutation Surveyor (SoftGenetics	 State College	 PA). CBL mutations are numbered relative to the ATG (A = 1) in the Ensembl cDNA sequence ENSG00000110395. A dropping factor (relative intensity drop of the wild-type allele peak relative to that seen in a concurrently run normal sample) of 60% or more was considered indicative of a biallelic mutation whereas a dropping factor of less than 60% was considered as monoallelic. Primer sequences for CBL exon 8 were CBL_i7f (5â€²-tgtggtttcactttaaaccctgga-3â€²) and CBL_i8r (5â€²-gccaggccaccccttgtatc-3â€²) and for CBL exon 9 were CBL_i8f (5â€²-ggcctggcttttgggttagg-3â€²) and CBL_i9r (5â€²-cacaatggattttgccagtctcc-3â€²). CBL reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) was performed on random hexamerâ€“reverse transcribed RNA using primers CBLe7F: 5â€²-gaatcctgatctgactggcttatg-3â€² and CBLe10R 5â€²-gctgcggcagaaggtcaagt-3â€². Other primer sequences are available on request.  Microsatellite analysis  DNA samples were amplified with a series of fluorescently labeled primer pairs flanking highly polymorphic microsatellite markers on chromosome 11q as described.10 aUPD was scored if 4 or more consecutive markers encompassing CBL were homozygous without change in allelic copy number (P < .05 of this occurring in the absence of aUPD based on published rates of heterozygosity). Copy number at 11q was estimated by multiplex ligation probe amplification (MLPA) using the Marfan probeset 1 (P065; MRC Holland	 Amsterdam	 The Netherlands)	 a kit that contains four 11q control probes including one at 11q23.3.  Constructs  pMY-wtCBL and pMY-CBLR420Q express wild-type and R420Q CBL	 respectively	 along with green fluorescent protein (GFP).15 Other CBL mutant constructs were derived from pMY-wtCBL using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene	 La Jolla	 CA). pAL/FLT3 and pCMVâ€“HA ubiquitin have also been described previously.15  Cell lines  The IL-3â€“dependent murine myeloid cell 32Dcl3 (32D) was purchased from the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (Braunschweig	 Germany) and was maintained in 90% RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10% WEHI-3B conditioned medium (WEHI). All cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37Â°C and 5% carbon dioxide. 32D cells were stably transduced by electroporation with wt-FLT3 in a pAL vector as previously described16 and maintained in 15 ng/mL blastocidin (Invitrogen	 Paisley United Kingdom). The Platinum-E (Plat-E) retrovirus packaging cell line17 was transfected using the calcium phosphate method with 5 Î¼g CBL construct DNA: 106 32D/wtFLT3 cells were cocultivated with the Plat-E cells for 48 hours in a volume of 2 mL (50% RPMI	 50% DMEM	 10% FBS	 5% WEHI). GFP positive cells were flow sorted to highest possible purity using a BD FACSAria cell sorter (Becton Dickinson	 Stanford	 CA). If insufficient cells were obtained for experiments after flow sorting	 the cells were maintained in culture and resorted to greater than 95% purity.  Growth factor withdrawal assays  Cell growth was compared with wt-FLT3	 vector-only transfected cells and the parental 32D line in stably transfected cells. Cells (105/mL) were grown over 3 days in triplicate for each CBL mutant and a wt-CBL control in 96-well plates. Cultures were analyzed daily for proliferation using the Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit (MTS assay; Promega	 Southampton	 United Kingdom). All experiments were performed at least 3 times independently and results were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 4 software (GraphPad Software	 San Diego	 CA).  Ubiquitin ligase activity  The ubiquitin ligase activity of CBL mutants in comparison to wild-type CBL was determined by transiently transfecting 107 32D/wtFLT3 cells expressing wild-type or CBL mutants by electroporation with 20 Î¼g pCMV-HA ubiquitin. Cells were maintained in culture with WEHI for 12 hours after transfection before being washed	 serum deprived overnight	 exposed to FLT3 ligand for 10 minutes	 and lysed in buffer as described.18 Lysates were incubated with a FLT3-specific polyclonal antibody overnight at 4Â°C. Protein G agarose beads (100 Î¼L) were added and incubated at 4Â°C for 4 hours. The beads were washed 4 times in ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer. The supernatant was mixed with sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) sample loading buffer before immunoblot analyses with antibodies against HA-ubiquitin (sc-805; Santa Cruz Biotechnology	 Santa Cruz	 CA)	 CBL (2111C3a; Abcam	 Cambridge	 United Kingdom)	 and FLT3 (sc-479; Cell Signaling Technology	 Danvers	 MA).  Results  SNP array analysis  We performed genome-wide SNP analysis on leukocyte DNA extracted from 58 MPD patients: aCML (n = 30)	 V617F JAK2 negative MF (n = 18)	 and JAK2 mutation negative PV/idiopathic erythrocytosis (n = 10). As comparators	 we also analyzed cases of CML in transformation to blast crisis (n = 30	 of which 20 were myeloid and 10 lymphoid) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; n = 20). We conservatively defined likely regions of aUPD as at least 20 Mb of absent or significantly reduced heterozygous SNP calls (ie	 < 5% SNPs called as heterozygous) running to a telomere without change in copy number (Figure 1A). Such large regions are uncommon in healthy individuals.19 Strikingly	 we found that aUPD was common in aCML with 10 (33%) of cases affected. In contrast	 aUPD was only seen in a single case of MF and was not seen in other patient subgroups. In total	 7 different chromosomes were affected	 with abnormalities at 7q and 11q each seen recurrently in 10% of aCML cases. The affected regions ranged in size from 29 Mb to a complete copy of chromosome 13 (Table 1).

The 2 panels on the right are from a chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) blast crisis case and show LOH accompanied by a 20q deletion.

Two controls are shown: an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient previously known to have a heterozygous FLT3 ITD and a healthy individual. View inlineView popup Table 1 Chromosomal regions and cases affected by aUPD Association between aUPD and known acquired oncogenic mutations  Although we did not have constitutional DNA to formally confirm that the regions of homozygosity were acquired	 in 1 individual we found a marked reduction in the proportion of 11q aUPD positive cells on comparison of mononuclear cells and granulocytes	 consistent with an acquired abnormality (Figure 1B). Some of the affected regions harbor genes known to be relevant to hematologic malignancies and therefore we assessed their mutational status. Sequencing of the MPL gene in the case UPN 27 with 1p aUPD revealed a homozygous G>T change (Figure 1C) that results in the previously reported W515L substitution.9 Case UPN 28 with whole chromosome 13 UPD had a homozygous FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD; Figure 1D). Candidate genes for the abnormalities at 17q and 21q include NF1 and RUNX1	 respectively; however	 these were not investigated.  11q aUPD is associated with CBL mutations  Next	 we focused our analysis on the 2 recurrent regions of aUPD at 7q and 11q. Because of the strong association between MPNs and aberrant tyrosine kinase signaling	 we analyzed genes encoding tyrosine kinases and associated signaling components. The minimally affected region at chromosome 7q contains 3 tyrosine kinases: MET	 EPHA1	 and EPHB6. We fully sequenced the coding exons of these genes in the 3 cases with 7q aUPD and 2 normal controls but found no abnormalities. Similarly	 we found no sequence changes in exons 11 through 17 of BRAF	 a gene encoding a downstream component of RAS signaling that is mutated in malignant melanoma and other cancers.20 There are no tyrosine kinase genes on chromosome 11q	 and although there are several genes encoding signal transduction components	 CBL stood out as a known oncogene that negatively regulates tyrosine kinase signaling.21 Sequencing of CBL in the three 11q aUPD cases revealed that UPN 2 and UPN 5 each had a T>C change at nucleotide 1277 in exon 8 that predicts a L380P substitution. Case UPN 3 had a C>G missense change in exon 9 at nucleotide 1387 that predicts a P417A change (Figure 2). Consistent with the array results	 the mutations in cases UPN 3 and UPN 5 were predominant with the residual wild-type alleles only weakly visible. For case UPN 2 both the mutation and level of aUPD was less prominent	 presumably due to a greater background of normal cells.

Prevalence and nature of CBL mutations  To determine the prevalence of CBL mutations	 we sequenced exons 8 and 9 (that encode amino acids 366 through 409 and 410 through 477	 respectively) in an additional 574 MPN cases. A total of 27 sequence variants were identified in 26 patients	 of whom 3 had MF	 10 had chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML)	 12 had aCML and 1 had hypereosinophilic syndrome/chronic eosinophilic leukemia (HES/CEL; Tables 2 and 3). To ensure that we were not missing mutations elsewhere in the gene we analyzed all coding exons in 70 CBL mutation negative aCML or unclassified	 CML-like MPN cases by high resolution melt (HRM) analysis but failed to detect any further sequence changes apart from known polymorphisms. Similarly	 no mutations in CBLB exons 9 or 10 or CBLC exons 7 and 8 (the exons that correspond to CBL exons 8 and 9) were identified. The activity of BCR-ABL is known to increase during progression of CML from chronic phase to blast crisis22 and we speculated that abrogation of CBL activity might be at least partially responsible for this increase. HRM analysis of CBL exons 8 and 9 in blast crisis cases (n = 31)	 however	 failed to reveal any mutations.  View inlineView popup Table 2 Cases analyzed for CBL mutations View inlineView popup Table 3 List of CBL sequence variants Of the 27 CBL variants	 21 (78%) were missense substitutions affecting 12 amino acids (15 different substitutions)	 5 (19%) were candidate splicing abnormalities	 and 1 (3%) produced a stop codon (Table 3). Most of the changes were novel	 although 4 cases had R420Q as previously identified in a single case of AML.15 Apart from N454D	 all residues affected by missense mutations were completely conserved in CBL orthologues as well as the 2 other human CBL family members (Figure 3). The mutation to a stop codon was found in a patient (UPN 9) who also had the Y371H variant; PCR across the affected regions and sequencing indicated that the 2 changes were on different alleles.

Residues affected by missense mutations found in this study are indicated by â–¼. CBL mutations are acquired and rarely seen in conjunction with other known mutations  For 2 cases (UPN 5 and UPN 14) we were able to compare the mutational status of leukocytes and T cells or buccal epithelia cells. In both cases the L380P mutation was only present in leukocytes and was therefore acquired (Figure 4A). A third case (UPN 15) originally presented with V617F JAK2 negative ET in 1989 but progressed to MF in 2004. Analysis of DNA extracted from sequential bone marrow slides indicated that the R420Q mutation was absent at the ET phase but acquired on transformation (Figure 4B). The 3 CBL-positive MF cases tested negative for MPL 515 mutations and all CBL mutation positive cases were negative for cytogenetic indicators of tyrosine kinase fusions	 FLT3 ITD	 activating NRAS mutations and V617F JAK2	 with the exception of 1 case (UPN 14) with MF who tested positive for both L380P CBL and V617F JAK2. Analysis of retrospective bone marrow slides for this case indicated the presence of V617F JAK2 at low level initially but absence of L380P CBL. The CBL mutation was detectable 7 years later and completely displaced V617F after a further 3 years	 corresponding with a significant rise is peripheral leukocyte counts (Figure 4C). A further case (UPN 21) presented with systemic mastocytosis before evolving to CBL mutation-positive CMML but retrospective samples were unavailable.

The JAK2 V617F mutation	 which had been present at low level since diagnosis	 was still detectable when CBL L380P first appeared but was undetectable in the 2008 sample	 when the CBL mutated clone predominated (* on sequence trace). (D) RT-PCR analysis. All cases and controls show the expected product from CBL exons 7-10. Cases UPN 18 and UPN 20 show smaller bands that result from complete deletion of exon 8. Splicing abnormalities  RNA was available for 3 of the 5 cases with potential splicing mutations. Patients UPN 18 and UPN 20 both exhibited double bands by RT-PCR	 sequencing of which showed one to be the normal product and the smaller band to result from the complete deletion of exon 8 in each case (Figure 4D)	 similar to that described in the cell line MOLM-13.23 Patient UPN 19 showed a single band by RT-PCR that was entirely normal on sequence analysis indicating that the exon 8+4 C>T change does not alter splicing. It seems likely	 therefore	 that the variant identified in case UPN 6 is also of no consequence. The pathogenicity of the intronic variant seen in case UPN 13 remains unknown.  The association between CBL mutations and UPD  To examine the association between CBL mutations and aUPD in more detail we performed microsatellite analysis on all mutated cases using 9 polymorphic markers spanning chromosome 11q13-qter. Of the 26 cases	 11 displayed patterns that indicated significant tracts of homozygosity	 including all 3 with 11q aUPD detected by SNP arrays. Case UPN 9 with 2 mutations was heterozygous for all markers. Of the 11 cases with biallelic CBL mutations as judged by sequence analysis	 5 showed complete homozygosity at all microsatellite loci tested and 6 had at least 4 consecutive homozygous calls encompassing the location of the CBL gene at 11q23.3 (Figure 5). We performed multiplex ligation probe amplification (MLPA) analysis to determine whether the observed homozygosity was a consequence of a deletion but no copy number changes were detected (data not shown) and therefore it is likely that homozygosity arose by aUPD. The number of mutated alleles estimated by sequencing was concordant with the microsatellite analysis in 20 cases (Figure 5). Of those that were discordant	 UPN 6 and UPN 25 had significant tracts of 11q homozygosity but had a monoallelic CBL mutation whereas UPN 10 and UPN 16 did not show 11q homozygosity but had clear biallelic CBL mutations. The reason for these discrepant cases is unclear	 but it is possible that the aUPD seen in UPN 6 and UPN 25 targeted another gene at 11q before acquisition of the CBL mutation. Homozygosity for the CBL mutations in the absence of 11q aUPD in UPN 10 and UPN 16 might be explained by a subcytogenetic deletion of 1 allele.  Figure 5 Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpoint Figure 5 Microsatellite analysis of CBL mutation positive cases. The number of CBL mutated alleles (1 monoallelic; 2 biallelic) was estimated by sequence analysis as described in â€œExperimental procedures.â€ Microsatellites were scored as homozygous (Embedded Image) or heterozygous (â–¡) for each case and their positions on chromosome 11q are indicated. Correlation between CBL mutations and clinical features  We compared clinical and hematologic features in patients with or without CBL mutations	 restricting the analysis to cases with aCML	 MF and CMML because these were the subgroups in which CBL mutations were most commonly found. Patients with CBL mutations had a shorter overall survival and progression-free survival compared with mutation negative cases (overall survival: 33 months vs 39 months; progression-free survival: 22 months vs 32 months) but the differences were not significant (Figure 6). Similarly there was no significant difference in gender distribution	 age and standard hematologic parameters between mutation positive and mutation negative cases and no differences emerged when individual disease entities were considered.

Overall survival (A) and progression-free survival (B) for atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML)	 chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML)	 and MF cases with (n = 19) or without (n = 87) CBL mutations. The differences between mutation positive and negative cases was not significant as determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Transforming activities of CBL mutants  We determined whether selected CBL variants had oncogenic activity by testing whether they could transform the interleukin-3 (IL-3)â€“dependent cell line 32D to growth factor independence in conjunction with overexpression of wild-type FLT3	 as has been described previously for R420Q.15 We found that S376F	 H398Y	 P417A	 and R420Q alone each conferred a degree of growth factor independence to 32D cells	 but this effect was considerably enhanced in 32Ds that overexpressed wild-type FLT3. In contrast	 wild-type CBL conferred no growth advantage either with or without FLT3 overexpression. The N454D change was not transforming	 indicating that it is probably a rare polymorphism or a pathogenetically unimportant passenger mutation (Figure 7). Reproducible differences in survival between the different mutants were seen	 as illustrated in Figure 8A.  Figure 7 Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpoint Figure 7 Transforming activity of CBL mutants. 32D cells or 32Ds overexpressing wild-type FLT3 were transfected with wild-type or mutant CBL constructs and assayed for IL-3 independent growth over 3 days.

(B) 32D cells expressing wild-type FLT3 and CBL constructs as indicated were transfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin and stimulated with FLT3 ligand. After lysis	 FLT3 was immunoprecipitated	 blotted	 and probed with anti-HA. Total blots for FLT3 AND CBL are also shown. Abrogation of E3 ubiquitin ligase activity  It has been shown that FLT3 physically associates with CBL and that	 upon ligand stimulation	 FLT3 is rapidly ubiquitinylated by wild-type but not R420Q CBL.15 We found that transforming activity correlated directly with the ubiquitin ligase activity of the CBL variants	 as assayed by their ability to transfer HA-tagged ubiquitin to FLT3 after stimulation with FLT3 ligand. The S376F	 H398Y	 P417A and R420Q mutants showed loss of ubiquitin ligase activity	 whereas N454D was comparable to wild-type CBL (Figure 8B).  Discussion  The initial aim of our study was to identify large regions of aUPD and therefore we undertook a relatively low resolution genome scan using 50k SNP arrays. Because we did not have constitutional DNA available from most of our cases	 we were not able to unambiguously determine whether the extended blocks of homozygosity that we observed were a consequence of aUPD	 constitutional UPD or autozygosity due to consaguinity	 however we used a very conservative definition of candidate aUPD regions (at least 20 Mb homozygous SNPs calls running to a telomere) and therefore expected that most or all would be acquired. We found that aUPD was relatively common in aCML	 but was uncommon in other MPNs that were negative for known mutations	 plus also CML blast crisis and CLL. Six distinct regions of aUPD were identified in aCML	 indicating substantial genetic heterogeneity in the genesis of this disorder. However	 we identified 2 recurrent regions of aUPD at 7q and 11q that were each seen in 10% of cases indicating the presence of common molecular abnormalities.  Our mutation screening focused primarily on tyrosine kinases and associated signal transduction components because of the known association between deregulated tyrosine kinase signaling and MPNs.3 Although we failed thus far to identify any abnormality on chromosome 7q	 we found missense CBL mutations in all three 11q aUPD cases. Screening of further MPNs revealed a total of 27 CBL variants in 26 patients who had been diagnosed with aCML (n = 12; 8%)	 MF (n = 3	 6%)	 CMML (n = 10	 13%)	 or HES/CEL (n = 1	 1%); that is	 morphologically and clinically related diseases that generally exhibit a poor prognosis. We were unable to discern	 however	 any specific clinical or prognostic features specifically associated with CBL mutated cases.  Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (CBL) is a well characterized protein that plays both positive and negative regulatory roles in tyrosine kinase signaling. In its positive role	 CBL binds to activated receptor tyrosine kinases via its N-terminal tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain and serves as an adaptor by recruiting downstream signal transduction components such as SHP2 and P13K. However the RING domain of CBL has E3 ligase activity and ubiquitinylates activated receptor tyrosine kinases on lysine residues	 a signal that triggers internalization of the receptor/ligand complex and subsequent recycling or degradation.21	24	25 CBL was originally identified after the characterization of v-Cbl	 the transforming component of the Cas NS-1 retrovirus	 and thus its association with neoplasia is well established26; however	 it is only very recently that CBL mutations were first identified in a human malignancy	 specifically occasional cases of AML.15	23	27 We have found that CBL mutations are much more common in MPNs	 and previous reports of 11q aUPD in MDS28 suggest that CBL mutations will also prove to be common in this disease. Indeed	 7 of 12 MDS cases with aUPD at 11q were recently shown to harbor CBL mutations.29 There are 2 other human CBL family members	 CBLB and CBLC	 but we did not identify aUPD in the regions containing these genes and did not detect any mutations of the linker/RING domain of CBLB.  We identified a total of 15 different CBL missense mutations affecting 12 residues (Table 2; Figure 3). Mutations of some of these residues (eg	 Y371	 C381	 H398 and W408) have been analyzed previously in a study that concluded that loss of E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and concomitant impairment of EGFR internalization by RING finger mutations was insufficient for oncogenicity	 as assayed in NIH3T3 cells. However mutations of key residues within the Î±-helix of the linker region abolished ubiquitin ligase activity and were transforming.30 Although the precise amino acid substitutions we identified were different from those studied	 we found that mutations in both the RING finger and linker regions conferred autonomous growth to 32D/wt-FLT3 cells	 consistent with a causal relationship to the MPN phenotype. The fact that one mutation (N454D) was not transforming emphasizes the importance of functional analysis to distinguish driver mutations from irrelevant passengers or infrequent polymorphisms.31 Notably	 this mutation was only weakly conserved between species	 in contrast to all other missense mutations that affected highly conserved residues and are therefore likely to be functionally significant.  Enhanced autonomous growth in the presence of CBL mutations and overexpression of wild-type FLT3 may simply reflect the paucity of receptor tyrosine kinase gene expression in 32D cells or	 alternatively	 may indicate that the mutants are only weakly transforming and require the cooperation of other events to give rise to clinically manifest disease. Consistent with the latter hypothesis	 we identified 2 cases in which CBL mutations were acquired during progression of a preexisting MPN (Figure 4). In both cases the identity of the cooperating change is unknown: although one presented with a (relatively low level) V617F JAK2 mutation	 this disappeared on progression to CBL L380P positive disease	 indicating that the 2 mutations must have arisen independently in different clones. This is reminiscent of the observation that the leukemic blasts of approximately half of V617F positive MPNs that evolve to AML are negative for the JAK2 mutation.32	33 It remains to be established	 however	 if CBL mutations are usually secondary events or whether the 2 cases we identified are exceptional.  Further evidence for the requirement for additional cooperating genetic events comes from published mouse studies in which neither complete CBL knockout nor heterozygous knockin of the RING finger inactivating mutant C379A (mouse C379 is equivalent to human C381) resulted in evidence of an MPN or other malignancy.34	35 However	 closer analysis revealed subtle hemopoietic perturbations that clearly relate to the pathogenesis of MPNs. Specifically	 hemopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from these animals were increased in number	 hyperresponsive to thrombopoietin and more potent than wild-type HSCs in repopulating the hemopoietic system. These effects were associated with increased STAT5 accumulation and phosphorylation.34	35 Hyperresponsiveness to growth factors and stem cell involvement are 2 of the cardinal features of MPNs. Furthermore	 the association between STAT5 activation and MPNs is well documented.36	37 While it is possible that overt hematologic disease might have been induced by a homozygous knockin mutant	 these findings suggest that CBL mutations may not be solely responsible for a full MPN phenotype.  The nature of any cooperating abnormalities remains largely obscure. Our results show that overexpression of a tyrosine kinase can cooperate with CBL mutants to promote transformation	 however we failed to identify any kinase that was consistently overexpressed in mutation positive cases by tyrosine kinase expression profiling (data not shown). One CBL mutation positive case	 however	 also tested positive for 7q UPD by SNP array	 suggesting that these 2 abnormalities may complement each other. A CBL mutation resulting in skipping of exon 8 has also been identified in a murine model of NUP98-HOXD13 on progression from MDS to AML	38 further corroborating the theory that acute leukemia arises from complementary mutations	 one of which inhibits differentiation	 and a second (in this case CBL) that enhances proliferation or inhibits apoptosis.  The fact that many CBL mutations are associated with aUPD strongly suggests that clones with homozygous mutations have a selective advantage over those that are heterozygous. This contrasts with the prevailing view that transforming CBL RING finger and linker region mutants act in a dominant negative fashion. Although it is conceivable that another	 unknown locus on 11q is the target of aUPD	 the finding of 1 case with a Y371H mutation and a stop codon on opposite alleles strongly suggests that homozygous CBL mutations do indeed confer a direct selective advantage. Because we did not screen the entire gene for mutations	 it is possible that other cases with heterozygous mutations may also be functionally homozygous due to premature stop codons on the other allele. Alternatively	 heterozygosity in these cases may only be apparent due to variable proportions of background normal cells that are not part of the malignant clone. Although the nontransforming N454D mutant was heterozygous	 2 cases with heterozygous R420Q were observed and thus absence of homozygosity cannot be used to infer the presence of an irrelevant	 nontransforming sequence variant.  In summary	 we have found that oncogenic CBL mutations are acquired in a subset of hematologically related	 poor prognosis MPNs. Our findings further strengthen the notion that MPNs are primarily â€œtyrosine kinopathies	â€ that is	 diseases caused by aberrant activation of proliferation and survival pathways as a consequence of mutations that either directly or indirectly promote excess tyrosine kinase signaling. In view of the fact that tyrosine kinases are such good drug targets	 the possibility that CBL-mutated cases might be amenable to therapeutic inhibition is clearly attractive.  																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											
4	4||Oncogenic mutations in the monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) gene have been found in many tumors	 but their significance remains largely unknown. Several human c-Cbl (CBL) structures have recently been solved depicting the protein at different stages of its activation cycle and thus provide mechanistic insight underlying how stability-activity tradeoffs in cancer-related proteins may influence disease onset and progression. In this study	 we computationally modeled the effects of missense cancer mutations on structures representing four stages of the CBL activation cycle to identify driver mutations that affect CBL stability	 binding	 and activity. We found that recurrent	 homozygous	 and leukemia-specific mutations had greater destabilizing effects on CBL states than did random non-cancer mutations. We further tested the ability of these computational models assessing the changes in CBL stability and its binding to ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2	 by performing blind CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays in cells. Experimental CBL ubiquitin ligase activity was in agreement with the predicted changes in CBL stability and	 to a lesser extent	 with CBL-E2 binding affinity. Two-thirds of all experimentally tested mutations affected the ubiquitin ligase activity by either destabilizing CBL or disrupting CBL-E2 binding	 whereas about one-third of tested mutations were found to be neutral. Collectively	 our findings demonstrate that computational methods incorporating multiple protein conformations and stability and binding affinity evaluations can successfully predict the functional consequences of cancer mutations on protein activity	 and provide a proof of concept for mutations in CBL.  Keywords: CBL	 driver mutations	 protein interactions Go to: Introduction Whole exome sequencing of cancer patients has produced unprecedented amounts of data to analyze and interpret; these studies report a very large fraction of missense mutations which can potentially be implicated in tumorigenensis (1). Although some missense mutations can provide selective growth advantage to tumor cells (driver mutations)	 the large majority of them are considered to be neutral (passenger mutations). The mechanisms by which the driver variants may affect protein stability	 interactions	 and function remain largely unknown. Various computational methods have been developed to estimate the impacts of disease mutations on proteins but most of them exclusively use sequence features and do not explicitly utilize the protein three-dimensional structures	 their physico-chemical properties and dynamics (2	 3). Many cancers are characterized by (de)activation of certain proteins which may be a result of missense mutations (4). The interconversion between active and inactive states is highly regulated in proteins and it is not well understood how these regulatory mechanisms are disrupted in cancer. The development of in silico approaches to estimate the effects of disease mutations on protein activity	 stability and binding will help to define which are likely to be driver or passenger mutations. Moreover	 understanding the mechanisms of their actions would allow for prioritization of potential driver candidates for better targeted therapies to design drugs which might in turn compensate for the reduced/enhanced protein stability or activity.  The monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) RING finger ubiquitin ligase (E3) represents an exceptionally difficult yet important system to study the mechanisms of cancer mutations (5	 6). Strikingly	 proteins from this family play both positive and negative regulatory roles in tyrosine kinase signaling which is aberrantly activated in many cancers (5). Oncogenic mutations in the c-Cbl gene (referred to as CBL thereafter) were found in human myeloid neoplasms and other tumors (5) but the significance of these mutations and their impacts on CBL function were studied only for very few mutants (7). The mechanistic aspects of CBL cancer mutations can now be adequately addressed as several CBL structures have become available which represent the snapshots of different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1). All CBL proteins share a highly conserved N-terminus which includes a tyrosine kinaseâ€“binding domain (TKBD)	 a linker helix region (LHR) and a RING finger domain	 while the C-terminus comprises a proline-rich region (8). The RING domain of CBL has E3 activity and ubiquitinates activated receptor tyrosine kinases which subsequently targets them for degradation (8). At the same time	 since CBL proteins can bind to activated receptor tyrosine kinases via the TKBD domain	 they can serve as adaptors by recruiting downstream signal transduction components such as SHP2 and P13K (9	 10).  Figure 1 Figure 1 CBL activation cycle. The structures representing the activation cycle of CBL are shown. In the inactive closed state (nCBL) the protein exists in the cytosol. Upon activation of the RTK	 CBL can bind to the phosphorylated RTK (orange peptide) via TKBD ... Another aspect of CBL function which should be accounted for in modeling the effects of cancer mutations is that it can bind to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) in complex with ubiquitin (Ub) and a substrate protein	 thereby facilitating the transfer of Ub from E2 to a lysine residue of the substrate (11). The crystal structure of the inactive complex of CBL with E2 (UbcH7) was solved more than ten years ago (12) while the active phosphorylated CBL-E2 (UbcH5B) complex was resolved fairly recently (13). According to the latter study	 substrate binding and Tyr371 phosphorylation activates CBL by producing a large conformational change in order to place the RING domain and E2 in close proximity to the substrate. It was further confirmed that phosphorylation-induced conformational change is required for positioning of ubiquitin for effective catalysis (14).  Here we present a new approach	 which aims to assess the effects of cancer mutations on stability	 binding and activity of cancer related proteins. We apply computational models to four different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1) and perform blind in vivo experiments of CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination. We show a rather remarkable agreement of experimental EGFR ubiquitination by CBL mutants with the computed changes in CBL thermodynamic stability and to a lesser extent with CBL-E2 binding affinity. The computational models not only quantitatively predict the magnitude of the effects of mutations but also shed light on the mechanisms of their action. Namely	 we find that cancer mutations have greater destabilizing effects on four CBL states than random non-cancer mutations for recurrent	 homozygous and leukemia mutations. Most damaging cancer mutations happen in the sites involved in Zn-coordination and in the formation of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds within CBL or between CBL and E2. Overall cancer driver mutations affect different or multiple stages of the CBL activation cycle either completely abolishing its E3 activity or partially attenuating it. The computational models based on stability and binding affinity calculations can discriminate experimentally validated driver from passenger mutations (with the exception of two mutations) and outperform several state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods aiming to predict phenotypic impacts of mutations.  Go to: Materials and Methods Computational modeling and analysis  Mapping of CBL mutations The COSMIC database (15) stores data on somatic cancer mutations and integrates the experimental data from full-genome sequencing studies. We extracted 103 missense mutations for the CBL gene from the COSMIC database (15) that could be mapped to four available CBL structures in its activation cycle (Fig. 1). Cancer mutations were classified into different classes according to the frequency of observed samples (single and recurrent mutations)	 zygosity (homo- and heterozygous mutations)	 types of cancer (leukemia and sarcoma) and the involvement of mutations in Zn-coordination (Table S1). In addition	 all possible single nucleotide substitutions resulting in amino-acid changes in the CBL gene were performed to obtain a â€œRandomâ€ missense mutation reference set. After excluding mutations observed in COSMIC and mutations occurring on residues without known coordinates in crystal structures	 we obtained 2	102 random missense mutations (Table S1). We also searched the dbSNP database (16) but found very few benign variations in the CBL gene. Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.  Model preparation We investigated the effects of mutations on four states of the CBL activation cycle: (1) closed CBL state (nCBL)	 (2) partially opened CBL state bound to substrate (CBL-S)	 (3) unphosphorylated autoinhibitory CBL bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and (4) phosphorylated CBL bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1). It was previously noted that both UbcH5B and UbcH7 can bind specifically to CBL but only UbcH5B can facilitate ubiquitination (17). The crystal structures of nCBL (PDB id: 2Y1M) (13)	 CBL-S (PDB id: 2Y1N) (13) and pCBL-E2-S (PDB id: 4A4C) (13) were obtained directly from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (18). Only one crystal structure of the unphosphorylated inactive state of CBL bound to E2 (UbcH7) and Zap-70 peptide (PDB id: 1FBV) (12) was available in PDB. Although sequence identity between UbcH7 and UbcH5B proteins is 38%	 the structural similarity is very high with the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.04 Ã…. The unphosphorylated autoinhibitory structure of CBL-UbcH5B-S was therefore modeled based on CBL-UbcH7-S (PDB id: 1FBV) using Chimera (19). (Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.)  Minimization procedure We applied our recently developed optimization protocol for minimizing wild-type and mutant structures (20). Heavy side chain atoms without known coordinates and hydrogen atoms were added to the crystal structures using the VMD (version 1.9.1) program (21) with models immersed into rectangular boxes of water molecules extending up to 10 Ã… from the protein in each direction. Wild-type protein complexes were minimized for 40	000 steps using explicit TIP3P water model. The final minimized models of wild-type protein complexes were used to produce all mutant structures and then an additional 300-step minimization for all mutant structures was performed. The energy minimization was carried out with the NAMD program (version 2.9) (22) using the CHARMM27 force field (23). For unfolding free energy calculations we applied the optimization procedure implemented in the RepairPDB module of the FoldX program (24) which optimizes the side chain configurations to provide a repaired structure. (See Supplementary Materials and Methods for more information.)  Binding and unfolding free energy calculations Binding free energy and effects of mutations on binding affinity were calculated according to the approach introduced by us earlier (20). Energy calculations were based on the modified MM-PBSA method that combined the molecular mechanics terms with the Poissonâ€“Boltzmann continuum representation of the solvent (25) and statistical scoring energy functions with parameters optimized on experimental sets of several thousand mutations (equation 3). Binding free energy calculations were performed on minimized wild-type and mutant structures of inactive CBL-E2-S and active pCBL-E2-S states. The binding energy is defined as a difference between the free energies of the complex and unbound proteins.  Î”Gbind=GCBL-E2-S-GCBL-S-GE2 (1) The change of binding energy due to a mutation can be calculated as:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î”Gbindmut-Î”GbindWT (2) The effect of mutations on binding affinity was calculated in this work using the following energy function:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î±Î”Î”Evdw+Î²Î”Î”Gsolv+Î³Î”SAmut+ÎµÎ”Î”GBM+Î»Î”Î”GFD+Î´ (3) Here Î”Î”Evdw is the change of the van der Waals interaction energy and Î”Î”Gsolv is the change of the polar solvation energy of solute in water. Î”SAmut represents a term proportional to the interface area of the mutant complex. Î”Î”GBM and Î”Î”GFD are the binding energy changes from BeAtMuSiC and FoldX	 respectively. BeAtMuSiC (26) estimates the effect of mutations on binding based on statistical potentials.  The FoldX software program (24) was used to estimate the unfolding free energy and to model the unfolding state. FoldX calculates the effects of mutations on protein stability using an empirical force field. The BuildModel module was used to introduce a mutation	 optimize the configurations of the neighboring side chains and calculate the difference in stability (unfolding free energy) between mutant ( Î”Gfoldmut) and repaired native structure ( Î”GfoldWT).  Î”Î”Gfold=Î”Gfoldmut-Î”GfoldWT (4) For comparison we used three alternative methods to predict the impacts of mutations on unfolding free energy: the Eris server (27)	 the Rosetta program (28) and the PoPMuSiC server (29). We also applied four additional webtools to assess the impacts of amino acid substitutions on CBL function: PROVEAN (30)	 PolyPhen-2 (31)	 MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). (See Supplementary Methods for more information.)  Go to: Experimental procedures Expression constructs  Human CBL cDNA was originally obtained from Wallace Langdon and subsequently cloned into the pCEFL expression plasmid (34). Point mutation constructs	 described above	 were created from wild-type CBL using the QuikChange II Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions (Stratagene	 La Jolla	 CA). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.  Cell culture and transfections  The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T	 the human nonsmall cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the human cervical cancer cell line HeLa used in this study were originally obtained from ATCC and maintained in culture using DMEM (Gibco	 Grand Island	 NY) supplemented with 10% FBS	 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin sulfate. Cell lines were authenticated by Short Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis by using either Promega Powerplex 16 (Promega	 Madison	 WI) or the AmpFISTR Identifier Kit (Life Technologies	 Carlsbad	 CA) and compared to the ATCC or DSMZ databases. HeLa cells were received in the lab in 2013 last authenticated on 7-30-15	 A549 were received in the lab in 2015 and last authenticated on 8-12-15	 and HEK293T were received in the lab in 1995 and last authenticated on 10-8-15.HEK293T cells were transfected using calcium phosphate according to the instructions accompanying the reagent (Profection; Promega Corp.	 Madison	 WI)	 incubated 18 h prior to media change and grown for a total of 48 h prior to harvesting. A549 and Hela cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen	 Carlsbad	 CA). Transfections were allowed to incubate 6 h prior to media change	 and cells were grown an additional 48 h before being harvested. Cells were starved for 4 hours and treated with EGF (100 ng/ul). Each cell-based experiment was repeated at least two times.  Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation  To harvest proteins	 cells were washed twice in ice-cold Dulbeccoâ€™s PBS-containing 200 Î¼M sodium orthovanadate (Fisher Chemicals	 Fairlawn	 NJ) then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5	 150 mM NaCl	 5 mM EDTA	 1% Triton X-100	 10% glycerol	 100 mM iodoacetamide [Sigma-Aldrich Corp.	 St. Louis	 MO]	 2 mM sodium orthovanadate	 and protease inhibitors [Complete tabsÂ®	 Roche Diagnostics Corp.	 Indianapolis	 IN]). All whole cell lysates were cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 16	000 Ã— g for 15 m at 4 Â°C. Supernatant protein concentrations were determined using the BioRad protein assay (BioRad	 Hercules	 CA). For immunoblotting	 20Î¼g of whole cell lysates were boiled in a 1:1 dilution of 2X loading buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8	 10% glycerol	 2% SDS	 1 mg/ml bromophenol blue	 0.3573 M Î²-mercaptoethanol) for 5 m. For immunoprecipitations	 150 Î¼g of each of the whole cell lysates were incubated with rabbit anti-EGFR (Ab-3; Millipore) and with Protein A/G+ agarose beads (sc-2003; Santa Cruz Biotechnology	 Santa Cruz	 CA). All immunoprecipitations were incubated overnight at 4Â°C with tumbling. Immune complexes were washed five times in 1 mL cold lysis buffer	 then resuspended in 2X loading buffer	 boiled for 5 m	 then resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran BA85; Whatman	 Sanford	 MA). For immunoblot detection of proteins	 the following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-EGFR (2232L; Cell Signaling)	 rat monoclonal high affinity anti-HA-peroxidase	 (clone 3F10; Roche)	 rabbit anti-Cbl (sc-C-15; Santa Cruz) and mouse anti-Hsc70 (sc-7298; Santa Cruz). Horseradish peroxidase linked donkey anti-rabbit IgG (NA934V; GE Healthcare	 Piscataway	 NJ)	 or donkey anti-mouse IgG (NA931: GE Healthcare	 Piscataway	 NJ) immunoglobulin was used with SuperSignal (Pierce Biotechnology Inc.	 Rockford	 IL) to visualize protein detection.  Densitometric Analysis  Immunoblots were developed on HyBlot CL Autoradiography Film (Denville Scientific Inc.	 South Plainfield	 NJ) with an X-OMAT automated processor (Eastman Kodak	 Rochester	 NY). Protein expression levels were then recorded using an Epson Perfection V750 PRO scanner (Epson Inc.	 Long Beach	 CA) and densitometric analysis was performed using Adobe Photoshop software version 7.0 (Adobe Systems Inc.	 U.S.A). EGFR ubiquitination signal intensity was determined by optical density in a set area normalized against the EGFR band intensity in parallel immunoblots and expressed as a densitometric ratio of ubiquitination/EGFR levels. The mean densitometric ratio of EGFR ubiquitination	 in the presence of each CBL mutation	 was then assessed relative to wild-type CBL where the ratio was set at 1.0.  Go to: Results Cancer mutations impact CBL stability  We estimated the thermodynamic stability (unfolding free energy) changes	 Î”Î”Gfold	 upon mutation for closed (nCBL) and partially opened (CBL-S) CBL states (Fig. 1). These states did not involve binding to E2. The examination of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for random non-cancer mutations (Fig. 2A) showed that it was very similar to experimental distributions produced by random mutagenesis on a set of different proteins (35	 36). Namely	 the distribution for random non-cancer mutations was asymmetrically centered at positive energy values and there were about 10% of random mutations with highly damaging effects on CBL structures by more than 5 kcal molâˆ’1 (Fig. 2A). Despite the presence of highly damaging random mutations	 recurrent cancer mutations overall produced significantly larger destabilizing effects compared to random (p-value â‰ª 0.01) for both nCBL and CBL-S states (Fig. 2A and S1	 Table S2). This was not the case for single cancer mutations observed in only one patient (Table S2). Overall	 the form of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for recurrent cancer mutations was different from the Î”Î”Gfold distribution of random mutations (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p-value â‰ª 0.01) whereas the distribution for single cancer mutations was indistinguishable from a random mutation distribution. However	 it does not mean that all single cancer mutants can be considered passenger	 as we show later	 this is not the case for some of them.  Figure 2 Figure 2 (A) The distribution of unfolding (Î”Î”Gfold) and binding (Î”Î”Gbind) free energy changes for Single	 Recurrent and Random class mutations on nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states (see SI for other states). Positive and negative values ... The top 25% cancer mutations with the largest damaging effects are presented in Table S3. Many of them occurred in Zn-coordinating sites while many others did not involve Zn-coordination sites. Some of these latter mutations (G415V	 G413R and G415S) introduced large Van der Waals clashes with neighboring residues which could not be accommodated by side chain rearrangements	 whereas other mutations (S376F	 Y371D and L405P) affected disulfide or hydrogen bonds. For example	 L405P located in the middle of an Î±-helix affected the CBL structure by introducing an energetically unfavorable kink in the helix due to its inability to donate an amide hydrogen bond.  Effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding  The outcome of mutations can be assessed by the extent of structural changes they induce. We calculated the local root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between the minimized wild-type and mutant structures around the mutated site. We found that the protein backbone in the vicinity of a mutation of the CBL-E2 complex underwent larger local conformational changes upon recurrent cancer mutations	 especially for mutations occurring in Zn-coordinating site clusters	 compared to random mutations (p-value â‰ª 0.01	 Fig. S2 and S3). In the previous section we analyzed the original closed (nCBL) state and partially opened (CBL-S) state induced by substrate binding. In this section we study the effects of cancer mutations on two other CBL states: an autoinhibitory CBL state bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and phosphorylated active CBL state bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1) (13). Effects of mutations on binding can be in general linked with their structural locations	 therefore we examined the locations of mutations and found that about one third of all cancer mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface (Fig. S4). This preference was found to be statistically significant (p-value â‰ª 0.01) (Fig. S4).  It was previously experimentally shown that binding between CBL and E2 was rather weak with a micromolar dissociation constant (13). Despite the fact that the interface between CBL and E2 in the inactive state is several residues larger than in the active state	 consistent with experiments	 we found somewhat stronger binding between CBL and E2 for the active state of CBL (Table S4). Similarly to the impacts of cancer mutations on stability	 recurrent (but not single) mutations destabilized CBL-E2 binding significantly (Fig. 2B	 S1 and Table S2). Importantly	 cancer mutations reduced the CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state (p-value = 0.002) (Fig. 2B) and the effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding of the active state were noticeably larger compared to random mutations even if we excluded mutations in Zn-coordinating sites (Table S2). This latter observation does not hold true for the autoinhibitory CBL-E2-S conformation.  Next	 all cancer mutations were ranked with respect to their effects on CBL-E2 binding. About half of all highly damaging mutations (top 25% of most damaging mutations	 Table S3) impacted both stability and CBL-E2 binding for all four CBL states. Among them	 several mutations occurred in Zn-coordinating clusters and M400 and L405 sites. Another class of mutations (involving W408 and R420 sites) mostly influenced CBL-E2 binding. For example	 the W408S mutation caused the largest perturbation in CBL-E2 binding of the active state by decreasing binding affinity up to 3.5 kcal molâˆ’1 but having a moderate effect on stability of the nCBL and CBL-S states. It was previously suggested that amino acids in positions W408 and I383 constituted specificity of CBL-E2 binding and corresponded to binding hot spots (10	 12). Mutations in the I383 site are not recorded in the COSMIC database although they have a profound destabilizing effect on CBL-E2 binding for both states (see data for random mutations on the ftp site ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/panch/CBL). Another site affecting binding of CBL (R420) is a highly conserved site in the CBL family	 it strongly interacts with the Q92	 W93 and S94 residues of E2. It was previously experimentally verified that mutations in this site disrupted the CBL activity and could be associated with cytokine-independent growth (37). There are 24 cancer patient samples where mutations of this site (R420Q	 R420L and R420P) are found and they all produce strong destabilizing effects on the active pCBL-E2-S state.  According to the zygosity annotation	 there are 49 heterozygous (â€œHeteroâ€) and 27 homozygous (â€œHomoâ€) mutations (Table S1) and for the rest of cancer mutations their zygocity status is undetermined. Overall	 we found that destabilizing mutations were enriched among homozygous compared to heterozygous mutations for all stages of CBL activation cycle (p-value = 0.021 â€“ 0.035) and were more prevalent in leukemia compared to sarcoma patients (p-value = 0.000 â€“ 0.003) (Fig. 2B	 Table S2). This observation could not be attributed to the prevalence of homozygous mutations in Zn-coordinating clusters since these clusters had almost equal numbers of heterozygous and homozygous mutations. It was reported earlier that many homozygous mutations could be connected to uniparental disomy when germline heterozygosity would lead to neoplasia upon reduction to homozygosity (6	38	 39). If some patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms had germline heterozygous mutations in CBL	 then lost the wild-type CBL allele and duplicated mutant allele	 it would be possible that the damaging mutant allele would be duplicated in a cancer cell with a higher probability. Indeed	 human leukemia samples show the loss of the normal CBL allele.  CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination: comparing experiments with computational models  Next we randomly picked fifteen cancer mutations based on their predicted damaging status	 trying to equally sample highly damaging and benign mutations irrespective to their frequencies in cancer samples	 and experimentally tested the E3 activity of wild-type and mutant CBL proteins (see Methods	 Table 1). As can be seen in Fig. 3A	 in the presence of wild-type CBL	 activation of the EGFR induced more than a 10-fold increase in the ubiquitination of the EGFR compared to empty vector (endogenous CBL levels) in HEK293T cells (compare lane 4 to lane 2 in top panel of Fig. 3A). The E3 activity of wild-type CBL was mirrored by a decrease in the levels of immunoprecipitated EGFR consistent with the targeting of ubiquitinated EGFR for degradation (compare lanes 2 and 4 in second panel of Fig. 3A).  Figure 3 Figure 3 (A) EGFR ubiquitination. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant CBL proteins along with the EGFR and hemagglutinin (HA)-epitope tagged ubiquitin. The vector control and wild-type	 CBL transfectant cells were incubated ... Table 1 Table 1 Experimental relative densitometry values for HEK293T cells	 predicted changes in stability (Î”Î”Gfold kcal molâˆ’1)	 binding affinity (Î”Î”Gbind kcal molâˆ’1) and comparison with other methods for 15 experimentally ... We classified all mutations into three groups (damaging	 attenuating and benign) according to their experimental relative densitometry data and compared experimental data with the estimates produced by the computational models. The first group of damaging mutants included C396R	 H398Q	 Y371H	 K382E and C381A which completely abolished CBL activity (relative densitometry was less than 10%) (Fig. 3B) and the levels of total EGFR were not decreased by these mutants (Fig. 3A). Only two of these mutants belonged to the Recurrent class of mutations. Table 1 shows predicted and experimentally verified effects of mutations on all four CBL states. All five mutants were predicted to be damaging by stability and binding affinity calculations but the mechanisms of their action were different. C396R	 H398Q and C381A mutations disrupted Zn-coordinating clusters and had very damaging consequences according to the stability model for both nCBL and CBL-S states and damaging effects on CBL-E2 binding even though none of these mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface. On the other hand	 the K382E mutation did not affect Zn-coordination but destabilized the nCBL state. This	 in turn	 could be explained by the charge substitution that led to the disruption of the K382-E373 salt bridge within the closed state of nCBL (Figure 4 and Figure S5A). Moreover	 K382E mutation had a significant impact on CBL-E2 binding due to the disruption of a salt bridge between pY371 and K382 affecting the stability of CBL in the active state (Figure 4 and Figure S5D). No significant changes were observed for CBL-S and CBL-E2-S states (Figure S5B	C). K382E mutation was previously observed in Noonan syndrome and was speculated to affect CBL stability or binding (40). Finally	 the Y371H mutation not only abolished phosphorylation at the Y371 site but also had a profound destabilizing effect on all four states as evident from Table 1.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Structures of wild type (green) and K382E mutant (tan) are shown for nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states. Salt bridges are shown as dashed lines and in both cases mutation affects the stability by disrupting the salt bridge. The second group of mutants (M374V	 V430M	 P428L	 Q249E and double mutant S80N/H94Y) maintained the CBL activity equivalent to or greater than wild-type CBL (relative densitometry of 80% or higher) (Fig. 3B). Consistent with this	 the levels of the activated EGFR were also decreased in these samples (Fig. 3A). To confirm that the retained E3 activity of these mutants was not cell type specific	 we transfected these mutants into the non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the cervical cancer cell line Hela (Fig. S6). The S80N/H94Y and Q249E mutations were previously identified in human non-small cell lung cancers making the A549 cell line a relevant cell type to investigate the function of these CBL mutants while other cancer mutations were found in other cancer types. As in the HEK293T cells	 transfection of wild-type CBL into A549 and HeLa cells resulted in a significant increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of EGFR compared to the cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. S6). The increase in transfected CBL protein compared to endogenous CBL protein was less in HeLa than in either the A549 or HEK293T cells. Consistent with this	 the fold increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of the EGFR by wild-type CBL was smaller in Hela cells (about three fold) compared to either A549 or HEK293T cells (more than 10 fold in each). As in HEK293T cells	 the Y371H mutant did not stimulate ubiquitination compared to the vector transfected control for A549 or HeLa cells (Fig. S6A and C). The CBL mutants that were fully active in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3A and B) maintained CBL E3 activity in A549 and HeLa cells (Fig. S6). Two of these CBL mutants resulted in more ubiquitination of EGFR compared to wild type CBL. For example	 the Q249E mutant showed an increased ubiquitination of EGFR in 293T and HeLa cells while the M374V mutant resulted in higher ubiquitination levels in A549 and HeLa cells (Figure 3 and S6). Only V430M mutant was on the borderline with the densitometry ratio of 0.8. All mutations from the second group were predicted to be benign according to our computational models	 whereas V430M	 consistent with experimental data	 had a borderline destabilizing impact on CBL-E2 binding (Table 1).  Finally	 the third group constituted mutations (L399V	 G375P	 P395A and V391I) which attenuated the CBL E3 activity according to the relative densitometry data (Fig. 3B). Only one of these mutants was observed in two cancer samples while other three belonged to the Single mutation class. Concordant with this	 there were intermediate levels of EGFR (Fig. 3A). G375P and P395A mutations were predicted to have partially damaging effects while V391I and L399V were classified as benign in our predictions. Interestingly	 mutations from this third group affected only some of the CBL states. In contrast	 the highly damaging mutations from the first group had damaging impacts on almost all CBL states.  Next we tested if the reduction in CBL ubiquitination activity was directly correlated with the effects of mutations on stability (Fig. 5A). The relationship between experimental densitometry data and Î”Î”Gfold was better described by an exponential dependence with correlation coefficient (R) of 0.77 and 0.78 for CBL-S and nCBL states respectively (Table S5). Indeed	 the change in absorption between wild-type and mutant proteins which refers to a fraction of active mutants can be described by the Boltzmann equation relating the probability of a state with the energy of this state. A mutation may lead to damaging effects and a loss of function if it impacts at least one of the CBL functional states. Taking this into consideration we calculated the correlation between densitometry and stability changes taking a maximum of Î”Î”Gfold values for the nCBL and CBL-S states. As shown in Fig. 5A and Table S5	 changes in stability can indeed explain the effects of mutations on CBL ubiquitination activity with high correlation of R = 0.83. For comparison	 several alternative methods were applied to predict the effect of mutations on unfolding free energy	 they all reported correlation coefficients ranging from 0.21 to 0.52	 with only one method PopMusic reporting a statistically significant correlation of 0.52 (Table S5). The relationship between densitometry and binding affinity changes was on the borderline of significance with a linear correlation coefficient of 0.48 and 0.62 (if two highly damaging mutations were excluded) (Fig. 5B and Table S5).  Figure 5 Figure 5 (A) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (exponential model) and maximal predicted changes in stability. (B) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (linear model) and predicted changes in binding affinity of pCBL-E2-S state. ... There are various methods which predict the phenotypic effects of mutations	 (30â€“33	 41) and some of them use structural features (31	 41). We applied four state-of-the-art independent methods to predict the impacts of mutations on CBL function: PROVEAN (30)	 PolyPhen-2 (31)	 MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). Some of these methods outperformed our model in classifying cancer from random mutations since they were trained to distinguish disease from neutral variants (Table S6). However	 all four methods had a very limited accuracy in classifying CBL cancer mutations into those that disrupted function and those that did not. As evident from Table 1 and Table S5	 all methods except for PROVEAN over-predicted damaging effects of experimentally tested mutations while PROVEAN was the only method which produced a significant correlation between the densitometry data and PROVEANâ€™s score (R=0.58	 Table S5).  Go to: Discussion Stability-activity balance in cancer related proteins  Evolutionary selection to maintain structural	 foldable and functional proteins eliminates many mutations in protein sequences. On the other hand	 thermodynamic stability can be compromised in evolution to ensure certain arrangements of catalytic and binding sites	 which might not be energetically optimal (36	 42). In tumorigenesis	 protein stability or binding may be reduced (or in some cases increased) due to cancer mutations. As a consequence it can lead to decreased fitness at the protein level	 but may confer a fitness advantage for the population of tumor cells (43	 44). However	 the extent of the stability-activity tradeoff in oncogenes and tumor suppressors remains largely unknown. Using the example of the CBL protein	 here we tried to elucidate the stability-activity balance and to understand whether the loss or gain of activity in cancer-related proteins can be accompanied by compromised stability or binding.  In contrast to many other computational studies	 which attempt to link stability with activity by mostly focusing on one protein conformation	 we performed an analysis on four different stages of the CBL activation cycle. Our predictions of changes in stability and binding were further elucidated by the experimental CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays. We found a strong relationship between the effects of mutations on CBL stability and experimentally obtained densitometry data (quantifying activity)	 while a relatively weaker correlation was observed between changes in densitometry and CBL-E2 binding affinity. It could be explained either by a less significant impact of experimentally tested mutations on CBL-E2 binding or by a limited coupling (compared to CBL stability) between CBL-E2 binding and E3 activity.  Drivers or passengers?  According to our study	 about two thirds of all experimentally tested mutations either completely abolished or attenuated E3 activity	 while one third of them were neutral. Trying to assess the limitations of our models	 we applied state-of- the-art methods commonly used to predict functional effects of mutations. However	 these methods failed to distinguish inactivating from neutral mutations as accurately as the computational models which were solely based on accounting for the effects on stability and binding for different CBL states. Indeed	 many methods are not specifically designed to discriminate driver from passenger mutations within the pool of cancer mutations	 but rather they perform a task of distinguishing cancer from neutral mutations.  Certainly	 the large majority of all mutations detected in cancer genomics studies are likely to be neutral although the collective burden of passenger mutations may also alter the course of tumorigenesis (45). When we analyzed the distribution of all single cancer missense mutations observed in the CBL gene	 their average effects on stability or binding were not found to be significantly different from the pool of random mutations. These mutations either mostly constitute true passenger mutations or their oncogenic mechanisms are not directly connected to protein destabilization. The story is quite the opposite for the recurrent mutations as they have on average significantly higher destabilizing effects than random mutations and the majority of them should be drivers. An interesting group of mutations includes those which are highly damaging but found only in one cancer sample (10% of all single cancer mutations). These mutations may represent either rare driver or latent driver mutations (46). Several of these mutations were experimentally tested and are listed in Table 1.  CBL-E2 binding in deciphering the mechanisms of cancer  Our analysis showed that cancer mutations reduce CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state. It is in contrast to the stability-activity tradeoff reported for EGFR and other cancer related proteins (47)	 where cancer mutations may disrupt autoinhibitory interactions and activate the kinase (48	 49). Importantly	 all mutations with experimentally tested high inactivating effects have impacts on both CBL stability and CBL-E2 binding (Table 1). In fact	 the correlation between Î”Î”Gfold and Î”Î”Gbind for CBL cancer mutations from COSMIC is positive (R = 0.20 â€“ 0.48 depending on the CBL state	 p-value < 0.05). It might seem counterintuitive as some residues maintain stability by sustaining the RING-TKBD autoinhibitory interactions within CBL. This interface overlaps with the CBL-E2 interface and competes against E2 binding (13). One might think that disruption of RING-TKBD interactions and destabilization of CBL might facilitate binding to E2 and therefore lead to CBL activation. A slight activation was actually observed for two mutants	 one of which (M374V) was directly located on the CBL-E2 interface. However	 as we showed through the positive high correlation between stability and activity changes	 this mechanism is rarely observed and the vast majority of mutations disrupt CBL-E3 activity by either destabilizing CBL and/or CBL-E2 binding or by directly affecting phosphorylation of the critical tyrosine Y371.  Overall	 our results support the idea that decrease of E3 activity	 of the ability to ubiquitinate receptor tyrosine kinases	 of CBL stability and/or CBL-E2 binding can give a selective advantage for tumor cells. However	 there are several factors that complicate deciphering the mechanisms of action of CBL cancer mutations. CBL mutations can be dominant-negative and mutated CBL might not only change the CBL E3 activity but also might affect the concentration and activity of the wild-type CBL. According to a ratiometric method to identify driver genes in cancer (1)	 CBL can be regarded as an oncogene since it has several mutation hot spots. On the other hand	 as shown in our study and in other studies	 cancer driver mutations can inactivate the E3 activity of CBL	 so it can also be regarded as a tumor suppressor. Although the latter fact complicates the development of CBL targeted therapies	 understanding the delicate balance among different CBL-affected pathways may facilitate the indirect drug targeting of damaged CBL proteins. The current genetics-based frameworks to analyze cancer genome-wide sequence data are necessary but not sufficient for understanding the processes of carcinogenesis and developing informed	 targeted therapies. Our approach	 which can be applied in general to different proteins of interest	 emphasizes the importance of the physics of binding and protein conformational ensembles in deducing the mechanisms of cancer.  																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			
4	5||Oncogenic mutations in the monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) gene have been found in many tumors	 but their significance remains largely unknown. Several human c-Cbl (CBL) structures have recently been solved depicting the protein at different stages of its activation cycle and thus provide mechanistic insight underlying how stability-activity tradeoffs in cancer-related proteins may influence disease onset and progression. In this study	 we computationally modeled the effects of missense cancer mutations on structures representing four stages of the CBL activation cycle to identify driver mutations that affect CBL stability	 binding	 and activity. We found that recurrent	 homozygous	 and leukemia-specific mutations had greater destabilizing effects on CBL states than did random non-cancer mutations. We further tested the ability of these computational models assessing the changes in CBL stability and its binding to ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2	 by performing blind CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays in cells. Experimental CBL ubiquitin ligase activity was in agreement with the predicted changes in CBL stability and	 to a lesser extent	 with CBL-E2 binding affinity. Two-thirds of all experimentally tested mutations affected the ubiquitin ligase activity by either destabilizing CBL or disrupting CBL-E2 binding	 whereas about one-third of tested mutations were found to be neutral. Collectively	 our findings demonstrate that computational methods incorporating multiple protein conformations and stability and binding affinity evaluations can successfully predict the functional consequences of cancer mutations on protein activity	 and provide a proof of concept for mutations in CBL.  Keywords: CBL	 driver mutations	 protein interactions Go to: Introduction Whole exome sequencing of cancer patients has produced unprecedented amounts of data to analyze and interpret; these studies report a very large fraction of missense mutations which can potentially be implicated in tumorigenensis (1). Although some missense mutations can provide selective growth advantage to tumor cells (driver mutations)	 the large majority of them are considered to be neutral (passenger mutations). The mechanisms by which the driver variants may affect protein stability	 interactions	 and function remain largely unknown. Various computational methods have been developed to estimate the impacts of disease mutations on proteins but most of them exclusively use sequence features and do not explicitly utilize the protein three-dimensional structures	 their physico-chemical properties and dynamics (2	 3). Many cancers are characterized by (de)activation of certain proteins which may be a result of missense mutations (4). The interconversion between active and inactive states is highly regulated in proteins and it is not well understood how these regulatory mechanisms are disrupted in cancer. The development of in silico approaches to estimate the effects of disease mutations on protein activity	 stability and binding will help to define which are likely to be driver or passenger mutations. Moreover	 understanding the mechanisms of their actions would allow for prioritization of potential driver candidates for better targeted therapies to design drugs which might in turn compensate for the reduced/enhanced protein stability or activity.  The monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) RING finger ubiquitin ligase (E3) represents an exceptionally difficult yet important system to study the mechanisms of cancer mutations (5	 6). Strikingly	 proteins from this family play both positive and negative regulatory roles in tyrosine kinase signaling which is aberrantly activated in many cancers (5). Oncogenic mutations in the c-Cbl gene (referred to as CBL thereafter) were found in human myeloid neoplasms and other tumors (5) but the significance of these mutations and their impacts on CBL function were studied only for very few mutants (7). The mechanistic aspects of CBL cancer mutations can now be adequately addressed as several CBL structures have become available which represent the snapshots of different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1). All CBL proteins share a highly conserved N-terminus which includes a tyrosine kinaseâ€“binding domain (TKBD)	 a linker helix region (LHR) and a RING finger domain	 while the C-terminus comprises a proline-rich region (8). The RING domain of CBL has E3 activity and ubiquitinates activated receptor tyrosine kinases which subsequently targets them for degradation (8). At the same time	 since CBL proteins can bind to activated receptor tyrosine kinases via the TKBD domain	 they can serve as adaptors by recruiting downstream signal transduction components such as SHP2 and P13K (9	 10).  Figure 1 Figure 1 CBL activation cycle. The structures representing the activation cycle of CBL are shown. In the inactive closed state (nCBL) the protein exists in the cytosol. Upon activation of the RTK	 CBL can bind to the phosphorylated RTK (orange peptide) via TKBD ... Another aspect of CBL function which should be accounted for in modeling the effects of cancer mutations is that it can bind to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) in complex with ubiquitin (Ub) and a substrate protein	 thereby facilitating the transfer of Ub from E2 to a lysine residue of the substrate (11). The crystal structure of the inactive complex of CBL with E2 (UbcH7) was solved more than ten years ago (12) while the active phosphorylated CBL-E2 (UbcH5B) complex was resolved fairly recently (13). According to the latter study	 substrate binding and Tyr371 phosphorylation activates CBL by producing a large conformational change in order to place the RING domain and E2 in close proximity to the substrate. It was further confirmed that phosphorylation-induced conformational change is required for positioning of ubiquitin for effective catalysis (14).  Here we present a new approach	 which aims to assess the effects of cancer mutations on stability	 binding and activity of cancer related proteins. We apply computational models to four different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1) and perform blind in vivo experiments of CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination. We show a rather remarkable agreement of experimental EGFR ubiquitination by CBL mutants with the computed changes in CBL thermodynamic stability and to a lesser extent with CBL-E2 binding affinity. The computational models not only quantitatively predict the magnitude of the effects of mutations but also shed light on the mechanisms of their action. Namely	 we find that cancer mutations have greater destabilizing effects on four CBL states than random non-cancer mutations for recurrent	 homozygous and leukemia mutations. Most damaging cancer mutations happen in the sites involved in Zn-coordination and in the formation of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds within CBL or between CBL and E2. Overall cancer driver mutations affect different or multiple stages of the CBL activation cycle either completely abolishing its E3 activity or partially attenuating it. The computational models based on stability and binding affinity calculations can discriminate experimentally validated driver from passenger mutations (with the exception of two mutations) and outperform several state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods aiming to predict phenotypic impacts of mutations.  Go to: Materials and Methods Computational modeling and analysis  Mapping of CBL mutations The COSMIC database (15) stores data on somatic cancer mutations and integrates the experimental data from full-genome sequencing studies. We extracted 103 missense mutations for the CBL gene from the COSMIC database (15) that could be mapped to four available CBL structures in its activation cycle (Fig. 1). Cancer mutations were classified into different classes according to the frequency of observed samples (single and recurrent mutations)	 zygosity (homo- and heterozygous mutations)	 types of cancer (leukemia and sarcoma) and the involvement of mutations in Zn-coordination (Table S1). In addition	 all possible single nucleotide substitutions resulting in amino-acid changes in the CBL gene were performed to obtain a â€œRandomâ€ missense mutation reference set. After excluding mutations observed in COSMIC and mutations occurring on residues without known coordinates in crystal structures	 we obtained 2	102 random missense mutations (Table S1). We also searched the dbSNP database (16) but found very few benign variations in the CBL gene. Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.  Model preparation We investigated the effects of mutations on four states of the CBL activation cycle: (1) closed CBL state (nCBL)	 (2) partially opened CBL state bound to substrate (CBL-S)	 (3) unphosphorylated autoinhibitory CBL bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and (4) phosphorylated CBL bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1). It was previously noted that both UbcH5B and UbcH7 can bind specifically to CBL but only UbcH5B can facilitate ubiquitination (17). The crystal structures of nCBL (PDB id: 2Y1M) (13)	 CBL-S (PDB id: 2Y1N) (13) and pCBL-E2-S (PDB id: 4A4C) (13) were obtained directly from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (18). Only one crystal structure of the unphosphorylated inactive state of CBL bound to E2 (UbcH7) and Zap-70 peptide (PDB id: 1FBV) (12) was available in PDB. Although sequence identity between UbcH7 and UbcH5B proteins is 38%	 the structural similarity is very high with the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.04 Ã…. The unphosphorylated autoinhibitory structure of CBL-UbcH5B-S was therefore modeled based on CBL-UbcH7-S (PDB id: 1FBV) using Chimera (19). (Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.)  Minimization procedure We applied our recently developed optimization protocol for minimizing wild-type and mutant structures (20). Heavy side chain atoms without known coordinates and hydrogen atoms were added to the crystal structures using the VMD (version 1.9.1) program (21) with models immersed into rectangular boxes of water molecules extending up to 10 Ã… from the protein in each direction. Wild-type protein complexes were minimized for 40	000 steps using explicit TIP3P water model. The final minimized models of wild-type protein complexes were used to produce all mutant structures and then an additional 300-step minimization for all mutant structures was performed. The energy minimization was carried out with the NAMD program (version 2.9) (22) using the CHARMM27 force field (23). For unfolding free energy calculations we applied the optimization procedure implemented in the RepairPDB module of the FoldX program (24) which optimizes the side chain configurations to provide a repaired structure. (See Supplementary Materials and Methods for more information.)  Binding and unfolding free energy calculations Binding free energy and effects of mutations on binding affinity were calculated according to the approach introduced by us earlier (20). Energy calculations were based on the modified MM-PBSA method that combined the molecular mechanics terms with the Poissonâ€“Boltzmann continuum representation of the solvent (25) and statistical scoring energy functions with parameters optimized on experimental sets of several thousand mutations (equation 3). Binding free energy calculations were performed on minimized wild-type and mutant structures of inactive CBL-E2-S and active pCBL-E2-S states. The binding energy is defined as a difference between the free energies of the complex and unbound proteins.  Î”Gbind=GCBL-E2-S-GCBL-S-GE2 (1) The change of binding energy due to a mutation can be calculated as:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î”Gbindmut-Î”GbindWT (2) The effect of mutations on binding affinity was calculated in this work using the following energy function:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î±Î”Î”Evdw+Î²Î”Î”Gsolv+Î³Î”SAmut+ÎµÎ”Î”GBM+Î»Î”Î”GFD+Î´ (3) Here Î”Î”Evdw is the change of the van der Waals interaction energy and Î”Î”Gsolv is the change of the polar solvation energy of solute in water. Î”SAmut represents a term proportional to the interface area of the mutant complex. Î”Î”GBM and Î”Î”GFD are the binding energy changes from BeAtMuSiC and FoldX	 respectively. BeAtMuSiC (26) estimates the effect of mutations on binding based on statistical potentials.  The FoldX software program (24) was used to estimate the unfolding free energy and to model the unfolding state. FoldX calculates the effects of mutations on protein stability using an empirical force field. The BuildModel module was used to introduce a mutation	 optimize the configurations of the neighboring side chains and calculate the difference in stability (unfolding free energy) between mutant ( Î”Gfoldmut) and repaired native structure ( Î”GfoldWT).  Î”Î”Gfold=Î”Gfoldmut-Î”GfoldWT (4) For comparison we used three alternative methods to predict the impacts of mutations on unfolding free energy: the Eris server (27)	 the Rosetta program (28) and the PoPMuSiC server (29). We also applied four additional webtools to assess the impacts of amino acid substitutions on CBL function: PROVEAN (30)	 PolyPhen-2 (31)	 MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). (See Supplementary Methods for more information.)  Go to: Experimental procedures Expression constructs  Human CBL cDNA was originally obtained from Wallace Langdon and subsequently cloned into the pCEFL expression plasmid (34). Point mutation constructs	 described above	 were created from wild-type CBL using the QuikChange II Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions (Stratagene	 La Jolla	 CA). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.  Cell culture and transfections  The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T	 the human nonsmall cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the human cervical cancer cell line HeLa used in this study were originally obtained from ATCC and maintained in culture using DMEM (Gibco	 Grand Island	 NY) supplemented with 10% FBS	 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin sulfate. Cell lines were authenticated by Short Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis by using either Promega Powerplex 16 (Promega	 Madison	 WI) or the AmpFISTR Identifier Kit (Life Technologies	 Carlsbad	 CA) and compared to the ATCC or DSMZ databases. HeLa cells were received in the lab in 2013 last authenticated on 7-30-15	 A549 were received in the lab in 2015 and last authenticated on 8-12-15	 and HEK293T were received in the lab in 1995 and last authenticated on 10-8-15.HEK293T cells were transfected using calcium phosphate according to the instructions accompanying the reagent (Profection; Promega Corp.	 Madison	 WI)	 incubated 18 h prior to media change and grown for a total of 48 h prior to harvesting. A549 and Hela cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen	 Carlsbad	 CA). Transfections were allowed to incubate 6 h prior to media change	 and cells were grown an additional 48 h before being harvested. Cells were starved for 4 hours and treated with EGF (100 ng/ul). Each cell-based experiment was repeated at least two times.  Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation  To harvest proteins	 cells were washed twice in ice-cold Dulbeccoâ€™s PBS-containing 200 Î¼M sodium orthovanadate (Fisher Chemicals	 Fairlawn	 NJ) then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5	 150 mM NaCl	 5 mM EDTA	 1% Triton X-100	 10% glycerol	 100 mM iodoacetamide [Sigma-Aldrich Corp.	 St. Louis	 MO]	 2 mM sodium orthovanadate	 and protease inhibitors [Complete tabsÂ®	 Roche Diagnostics Corp.	 Indianapolis	 IN]). All whole cell lysates were cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 16	000 Ã— g for 15 m at 4 Â°C. Supernatant protein concentrations were determined using the BioRad protein assay (BioRad	 Hercules	 CA). For immunoblotting	 20Î¼g of whole cell lysates were boiled in a 1:1 dilution of 2X loading buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8	 10% glycerol	 2% SDS	 1 mg/ml bromophenol blue	 0.3573 M Î²-mercaptoethanol) for 5 m. For immunoprecipitations	 150 Î¼g of each of the whole cell lysates were incubated with rabbit anti-EGFR (Ab-3; Millipore) and with Protein A/G+ agarose beads (sc-2003; Santa Cruz Biotechnology	 Santa Cruz	 CA). All immunoprecipitations were incubated overnight at 4Â°C with tumbling. Immune complexes were washed five times in 1 mL cold lysis buffer	 then resuspended in 2X loading buffer	 boiled for 5 m	 then resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran BA85; Whatman	 Sanford	 MA). For immunoblot detection of proteins	 the following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-EGFR (2232L; Cell Signaling)	 rat monoclonal high affinity anti-HA-peroxidase	 (clone 3F10; Roche)	 rabbit anti-Cbl (sc-C-15; Santa Cruz) and mouse anti-Hsc70 (sc-7298; Santa Cruz). Horseradish peroxidase linked donkey anti-rabbit IgG (NA934V; GE Healthcare	 Piscataway	 NJ)	 or donkey anti-mouse IgG (NA931: GE Healthcare	 Piscataway	 NJ) immunoglobulin was used with SuperSignal (Pierce Biotechnology Inc.	 Rockford	 IL) to visualize protein detection.  Densitometric Analysis  Immunoblots were developed on HyBlot CL Autoradiography Film (Denville Scientific Inc.	 South Plainfield	 NJ) with an X-OMAT automated processor (Eastman Kodak	 Rochester	 NY). Protein expression levels were then recorded using an Epson Perfection V750 PRO scanner (Epson Inc.	 Long Beach	 CA) and densitometric analysis was performed using Adobe Photoshop software version 7.0 (Adobe Systems Inc.	 U.S.A). EGFR ubiquitination signal intensity was determined by optical density in a set area normalized against the EGFR band intensity in parallel immunoblots and expressed as a densitometric ratio of ubiquitination/EGFR levels. The mean densitometric ratio of EGFR ubiquitination	 in the presence of each CBL mutation	 was then assessed relative to wild-type CBL where the ratio was set at 1.0.  Go to: Results Cancer mutations impact CBL stability  We estimated the thermodynamic stability (unfolding free energy) changes	 Î”Î”Gfold	 upon mutation for closed (nCBL) and partially opened (CBL-S) CBL states (Fig. 1). These states did not involve binding to E2. The examination of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for random non-cancer mutations (Fig. 2A) showed that it was very similar to experimental distributions produced by random mutagenesis on a set of different proteins (35	 36). Namely	 the distribution for random non-cancer mutations was asymmetrically centered at positive energy values and there were about 10% of random mutations with highly damaging effects on CBL structures by more than 5 kcal molâˆ’1 (Fig. 2A). Despite the presence of highly damaging random mutations	 recurrent cancer mutations overall produced significantly larger destabilizing effects compared to random (p-value â‰ª 0.01) for both nCBL and CBL-S states (Fig. 2A and S1	 Table S2). This was not the case for single cancer mutations observed in only one patient (Table S2). Overall	 the form of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for recurrent cancer mutations was different from the Î”Î”Gfold distribution of random mutations (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p-value â‰ª 0.01) whereas the distribution for single cancer mutations was indistinguishable from a random mutation distribution. However	 it does not mean that all single cancer mutants can be considered passenger	 as we show later	 this is not the case for some of them.  Figure 2 Figure 2 (A) The distribution of unfolding (Î”Î”Gfold) and binding (Î”Î”Gbind) free energy changes for Single	 Recurrent and Random class mutations on nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states (see SI for other states). Positive and negative values ... The top 25% cancer mutations with the largest damaging effects are presented in Table S3. Many of them occurred in Zn-coordinating sites while many others did not involve Zn-coordination sites. Some of these latter mutations (G415V	 G413R and G415S) introduced large Van der Waals clashes with neighboring residues which could not be accommodated by side chain rearrangements	 whereas other mutations (S376F	 Y371D and L405P) affected disulfide or hydrogen bonds. For example	 L405P located in the middle of an Î±-helix affected the CBL structure by introducing an energetically unfavorable kink in the helix due to its inability to donate an amide hydrogen bond.  Effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding  The outcome of mutations can be assessed by the extent of structural changes they induce. We calculated the local root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between the minimized wild-type and mutant structures around the mutated site. We found that the protein backbone in the vicinity of a mutation of the CBL-E2 complex underwent larger local conformational changes upon recurrent cancer mutations	 especially for mutations occurring in Zn-coordinating site clusters	 compared to random mutations (p-value â‰ª 0.01	 Fig. S2 and S3). In the previous section we analyzed the original closed (nCBL) state and partially opened (CBL-S) state induced by substrate binding. In this section we study the effects of cancer mutations on two other CBL states: an autoinhibitory CBL state bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and phosphorylated active CBL state bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1) (13). Effects of mutations on binding can be in general linked with their structural locations	 therefore we examined the locations of mutations and found that about one third of all cancer mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface (Fig. S4). This preference was found to be statistically significant (p-value â‰ª 0.01) (Fig. S4).  It was previously experimentally shown that binding between CBL and E2 was rather weak with a micromolar dissociation constant (13). Despite the fact that the interface between CBL and E2 in the inactive state is several residues larger than in the active state	 consistent with experiments	 we found somewhat stronger binding between CBL and E2 for the active state of CBL (Table S4). Similarly to the impacts of cancer mutations on stability	 recurrent (but not single) mutations destabilized CBL-E2 binding significantly (Fig. 2B	 S1 and Table S2). Importantly	 cancer mutations reduced the CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state (p-value = 0.002) (Fig. 2B) and the effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding of the active state were noticeably larger compared to random mutations even if we excluded mutations in Zn-coordinating sites (Table S2). This latter observation does not hold true for the autoinhibitory CBL-E2-S conformation.  Next	 all cancer mutations were ranked with respect to their effects on CBL-E2 binding. About half of all highly damaging mutations (top 25% of most damaging mutations	 Table S3) impacted both stability and CBL-E2 binding for all four CBL states. Among them	 several mutations occurred in Zn-coordinating clusters and M400 and L405 sites. Another class of mutations (involving W408 and R420 sites) mostly influenced CBL-E2 binding. For example	 the W408S mutation caused the largest perturbation in CBL-E2 binding of the active state by decreasing binding affinity up to 3.5 kcal molâˆ’1 but having a moderate effect on stability of the nCBL and CBL-S states. It was previously suggested that amino acids in positions W408 and I383 constituted specificity of CBL-E2 binding and corresponded to binding hot spots (10	 12). Mutations in the I383 site are not recorded in the COSMIC database although they have a profound destabilizing effect on CBL-E2 binding for both states (see data for random mutations on the ftp site ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/panch/CBL). Another site affecting binding of CBL (R420) is a highly conserved site in the CBL family	 it strongly interacts with the Q92	 W93 and S94 residues of E2. It was previously experimentally verified that mutations in this site disrupted the CBL activity and could be associated with cytokine-independent growth (37). There are 24 cancer patient samples where mutations of this site (R420Q	 R420L and R420P) are found and they all produce strong destabilizing effects on the active pCBL-E2-S state.  According to the zygosity annotation	 there are 49 heterozygous (â€œHeteroâ€) and 27 homozygous (â€œHomoâ€) mutations (Table S1) and for the rest of cancer mutations their zygocity status is undetermined. Overall	 we found that destabilizing mutations were enriched among homozygous compared to heterozygous mutations for all stages of CBL activation cycle (p-value = 0.021 â€“ 0.035) and were more prevalent in leukemia compared to sarcoma patients (p-value = 0.000 â€“ 0.003) (Fig. 2B	 Table S2). This observation could not be attributed to the prevalence of homozygous mutations in Zn-coordinating clusters since these clusters had almost equal numbers of heterozygous and homozygous mutations. It was reported earlier that many homozygous mutations could be connected to uniparental disomy when germline heterozygosity would lead to neoplasia upon reduction to homozygosity (6	38	 39). If some patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms had germline heterozygous mutations in CBL	 then lost the wild-type CBL allele and duplicated mutant allele	 it would be possible that the damaging mutant allele would be duplicated in a cancer cell with a higher probability. Indeed	 human leukemia samples show the loss of the normal CBL allele.  CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination: comparing experiments with computational models  Next we randomly picked fifteen cancer mutations based on their predicted damaging status	 trying to equally sample highly damaging and benign mutations irrespective to their frequencies in cancer samples	 and experimentally tested the E3 activity of wild-type and mutant CBL proteins (see Methods	 Table 1). As can be seen in Fig. 3A	 in the presence of wild-type CBL	 activation of the EGFR induced more than a 10-fold increase in the ubiquitination of the EGFR compared to empty vector (endogenous CBL levels) in HEK293T cells (compare lane 4 to lane 2 in top panel of Fig. 3A). The E3 activity of wild-type CBL was mirrored by a decrease in the levels of immunoprecipitated EGFR consistent with the targeting of ubiquitinated EGFR for degradation (compare lanes 2 and 4 in second panel of Fig. 3A).  Figure 3 Figure 3 (A) EGFR ubiquitination. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant CBL proteins along with the EGFR and hemagglutinin (HA)-epitope tagged ubiquitin. The vector control and wild-type	 CBL transfectant cells were incubated ... Table 1 Table 1 Experimental relative densitometry values for HEK293T cells	 predicted changes in stability (Î”Î”Gfold kcal molâˆ’1)	 binding affinity (Î”Î”Gbind kcal molâˆ’1) and comparison with other methods for 15 experimentally ... We classified all mutations into three groups (damaging	 attenuating and benign) according to their experimental relative densitometry data and compared experimental data with the estimates produced by the computational models. The first group of damaging mutants included C396R	 H398Q	 Y371H	 K382E and C381A which completely abolished CBL activity (relative densitometry was less than 10%) (Fig. 3B) and the levels of total EGFR were not decreased by these mutants (Fig. 3A). Only two of these mutants belonged to the Recurrent class of mutations. Table 1 shows predicted and experimentally verified effects of mutations on all four CBL states. All five mutants were predicted to be damaging by stability and binding affinity calculations but the mechanisms of their action were different. C396R	 H398Q and C381A mutations disrupted Zn-coordinating clusters and had very damaging consequences according to the stability model for both nCBL and CBL-S states and damaging effects on CBL-E2 binding even though none of these mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface. On the other hand	 the K382E mutation did not affect Zn-coordination but destabilized the nCBL state. This	 in turn	 could be explained by the charge substitution that led to the disruption of the K382-E373 salt bridge within the closed state of nCBL (Figure 4 and Figure S5A). Moreover	 K382E mutation had a significant impact on CBL-E2 binding due to the disruption of a salt bridge between pY371 and K382 affecting the stability of CBL in the active state (Figure 4 and Figure S5D). No significant changes were observed for CBL-S and CBL-E2-S states (Figure S5B	C). K382E mutation was previously observed in Noonan syndrome and was speculated to affect CBL stability or binding (40). Finally	 the Y371H mutation not only abolished phosphorylation at the Y371 site but also had a profound destabilizing effect on all four states as evident from Table 1.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Structures of wild type (green) and K382E mutant (tan) are shown for nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states. Salt bridges are shown as dashed lines and in both cases mutation affects the stability by disrupting the salt bridge. The second group of mutants (M374V	 V430M	 P428L	 Q249E and double mutant S80N/H94Y) maintained the CBL activity equivalent to or greater than wild-type CBL (relative densitometry of 80% or higher) (Fig. 3B). Consistent with this	 the levels of the activated EGFR were also decreased in these samples (Fig. 3A). To confirm that the retained E3 activity of these mutants was not cell type specific	 we transfected these mutants into the non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the cervical cancer cell line Hela (Fig. S6). The S80N/H94Y and Q249E mutations were previously identified in human non-small cell lung cancers making the A549 cell line a relevant cell type to investigate the function of these CBL mutants while other cancer mutations were found in other cancer types. As in the HEK293T cells	 transfection of wild-type CBL into A549 and HeLa cells resulted in a significant increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of EGFR compared to the cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. S6). The increase in transfected CBL protein compared to endogenous CBL protein was less in HeLa than in either the A549 or HEK293T cells. Consistent with this	 the fold increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of the EGFR by wild-type CBL was smaller in Hela cells (about three fold) compared to either A549 or HEK293T cells (more than 10 fold in each). As in HEK293T cells	 the Y371H mutant did not stimulate ubiquitination compared to the vector transfected control for A549 or HeLa cells (Fig. S6A and C). The CBL mutants that were fully active in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3A and B) maintained CBL E3 activity in A549 and HeLa cells (Fig. S6). Two of these CBL mutants resulted in more ubiquitination of EGFR compared to wild type CBL. For example	 the Q249E mutant showed an increased ubiquitination of EGFR in 293T and HeLa cells while the M374V mutant resulted in higher ubiquitination levels in A549 and HeLa cells (Figure 3 and S6). Only V430M mutant was on the borderline with the densitometry ratio of 0.8. All mutations from the second group were predicted to be benign according to our computational models	 whereas V430M	 consistent with experimental data	 had a borderline destabilizing impact on CBL-E2 binding (Table 1).  Finally	 the third group constituted mutations (L399V	 G375P	 P395A and V391I) which attenuated the CBL E3 activity according to the relative densitometry data (Fig. 3B). Only one of these mutants was observed in two cancer samples while other three belonged to the Single mutation class. Concordant with this	 there were intermediate levels of EGFR (Fig. 3A). G375P and P395A mutations were predicted to have partially damaging effects while V391I and L399V were classified as benign in our predictions. Interestingly	 mutations from this third group affected only some of the CBL states. In contrast	 the highly damaging mutations from the first group had damaging impacts on almost all CBL states.  Next we tested if the reduction in CBL ubiquitination activity was directly correlated with the effects of mutations on stability (Fig. 5A). The relationship between experimental densitometry data and Î”Î”Gfold was better described by an exponential dependence with correlation coefficient (R) of 0.77 and 0.78 for CBL-S and nCBL states respectively (Table S5). Indeed	 the change in absorption between wild-type and mutant proteins which refers to a fraction of active mutants can be described by the Boltzmann equation relating the probability of a state with the energy of this state. A mutation may lead to damaging effects and a loss of function if it impacts at least one of the CBL functional states. Taking this into consideration we calculated the correlation between densitometry and stability changes taking a maximum of Î”Î”Gfold values for the nCBL and CBL-S states. As shown in Fig. 5A and Table S5	 changes in stability can indeed explain the effects of mutations on CBL ubiquitination activity with high correlation of R = 0.83. For comparison	 several alternative methods were applied to predict the effect of mutations on unfolding free energy	 they all reported correlation coefficients ranging from 0.21 to 0.52	 with only one method PopMusic reporting a statistically significant correlation of 0.52 (Table S5). The relationship between densitometry and binding affinity changes was on the borderline of significance with a linear correlation coefficient of 0.48 and 0.62 (if two highly damaging mutations were excluded) (Fig. 5B and Table S5).  Figure 5 Figure 5 (A) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (exponential model) and maximal predicted changes in stability. (B) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (linear model) and predicted changes in binding affinity of pCBL-E2-S state. ... There are various methods which predict the phenotypic effects of mutations	 (30â€“33	 41) and some of them use structural features (31	 41). We applied four state-of-the-art independent methods to predict the impacts of mutations on CBL function: PROVEAN (30)	 PolyPhen-2 (31)	 MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). Some of these methods outperformed our model in classifying cancer from random mutations since they were trained to distinguish disease from neutral variants (Table S6). However	 all four methods had a very limited accuracy in classifying CBL cancer mutations into those that disrupted function and those that did not. As evident from Table 1 and Table S5	 all methods except for PROVEAN over-predicted damaging effects of experimentally tested mutations while PROVEAN was the only method which produced a significant correlation between the densitometry data and PROVEANâ€™s score (R=0.58	 Table S5).  Go to: Discussion Stability-activity balance in cancer related proteins  Evolutionary selection to maintain structural	 foldable and functional proteins eliminates many mutations in protein sequences. On the other hand	 thermodynamic stability can be compromised in evolution to ensure certain arrangements of catalytic and binding sites	 which might not be energetically optimal (36	 42). In tumorigenesis	 protein stability or binding may be reduced (or in some cases increased) due to cancer mutations. As a consequence it can lead to decreased fitness at the protein level	 but may confer a fitness advantage for the population of tumor cells (43	 44). However	 the extent of the stability-activity tradeoff in oncogenes and tumor suppressors remains largely unknown. Using the example of the CBL protein	 here we tried to elucidate the stability-activity balance and to understand whether the loss or gain of activity in cancer-related proteins can be accompanied by compromised stability or binding.  In contrast to many other computational studies	 which attempt to link stability with activity by mostly focusing on one protein conformation	 we performed an analysis on four different stages of the CBL activation cycle. Our predictions of changes in stability and binding were further elucidated by the experimental CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays. We found a strong relationship between the effects of mutations on CBL stability and experimentally obtained densitometry data (quantifying activity)	 while a relatively weaker correlation was observed between changes in densitometry and CBL-E2 binding affinity. It could be explained either by a less significant impact of experimentally tested mutations on CBL-E2 binding or by a limited coupling (compared to CBL stability) between CBL-E2 binding and E3 activity.  Drivers or passengers?  According to our study	 about two thirds of all experimentally tested mutations either completely abolished or attenuated E3 activity	 while one third of them were neutral. Trying to assess the limitations of our models	 we applied state-of- the-art methods commonly used to predict functional effects of mutations. However	 these methods failed to distinguish inactivating from neutral mutations as accurately as the computational models which were solely based on accounting for the effects on stability and binding for different CBL states. Indeed	 many methods are not specifically designed to discriminate driver from passenger mutations within the pool of cancer mutations	 but rather they perform a task of distinguishing cancer from neutral mutations.  Certainly	 the large majority of all mutations detected in cancer genomics studies are likely to be neutral although the collective burden of passenger mutations may also alter the course of tumorigenesis (45). When we analyzed the distribution of all single cancer missense mutations observed in the CBL gene	 their average effects on stability or binding were not found to be significantly different from the pool of random mutations. These mutations either mostly constitute true passenger mutations or their oncogenic mechanisms are not directly connected to protein destabilization. The story is quite the opposite for the recurrent mutations as they have on average significantly higher destabilizing effects than random mutations and the majority of them should be drivers. An interesting group of mutations includes those which are highly damaging but found only in one cancer sample (10% of all single cancer mutations). These mutations may represent either rare driver or latent driver mutations (46). Several of these mutations were experimentally tested and are listed in Table 1.  CBL-E2 binding in deciphering the mechanisms of cancer  Our analysis showed that cancer mutations reduce CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state. It is in contrast to the stability-activity tradeoff reported for EGFR and other cancer related proteins (47)	 where cancer mutations may disrupt autoinhibitory interactions and activate the kinase (48	 49). Importantly	 all mutations with experimentally tested high inactivating effects have impacts on both CBL stability and CBL-E2 binding (Table 1). In fact	 the correlation between Î”Î”Gfold and Î”Î”Gbind for CBL cancer mutations from COSMIC is positive (R = 0.20 â€“ 0.48 depending on the CBL state	 p-value < 0.05). It might seem counterintuitive as some residues maintain stability by sustaining the RING-TKBD autoinhibitory interactions within CBL. This interface overlaps with the CBL-E2 interface and competes against E2 binding (13). One might think that disruption of RING-TKBD interactions and destabilization of CBL might facilitate binding to E2 and therefore lead to CBL activation. A slight activation was actually observed for two mutants	 one of which (M374V) was directly located on the CBL-E2 interface. However	 as we showed through the positive high correlation between stability and activity changes	 this mechanism is rarely observed and the vast majority of mutations disrupt CBL-E3 activity by either destabilizing CBL and/or CBL-E2 binding or by directly affecting phosphorylation of the critical tyrosine Y371.  Overall	 our results support the idea that decrease of E3 activity	 of the ability to ubiquitinate receptor tyrosine kinases	 of CBL stability and/or CBL-E2 binding can give a selective advantage for tumor cells. However	 there are several factors that complicate deciphering the mechanisms of action of CBL cancer mutations. CBL mutations can be dominant-negative and mutated CBL might not only change the CBL E3 activity but also might affect the concentration and activity of the wild-type CBL. According to a ratiometric method to identify driver genes in cancer (1)	 CBL can be regarded as an oncogene since it has several mutation hot spots. On the other hand	 as shown in our study and in other studies	 cancer driver mutations can inactivate the E3 activity of CBL	 so it can also be regarded as a tumor suppressor. Although the latter fact complicates the development of CBL targeted therapies	 understanding the delicate balance among different CBL-affected pathways may facilitate the indirect drug targeting of damaged CBL proteins. The current genetics-based frameworks to analyze cancer genome-wide sequence data are necessary but not sufficient for understanding the processes of carcinogenesis and developing informed	 targeted therapies. Our approach	 which can be applied in general to different proteins of interest	 emphasizes the importance of the physics of binding and protein conformational ensembles in deducing the mechanisms of cancer.  																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			
5	6||Oncogenic mutations in the monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) gene have been found in many tumors	 but their significance remains largely unknown. Several human c-Cbl (CBL) structures have recently been solved depicting the protein at different stages of its activation cycle and thus provide mechanistic insight underlying how stability-activity tradeoffs in cancer-related proteins may influence disease onset and progression. In this study	 we computationally modeled the effects of missense cancer mutations on structures representing four stages of the CBL activation cycle to identify driver mutations that affect CBL stability	 binding	 and activity. We found that recurrent	 homozygous	 and leukemia-specific mutations had greater destabilizing effects on CBL states than did random non-cancer mutations. We further tested the ability of these computational models assessing the changes in CBL stability and its binding to ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2	 by performing blind CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays in cells. Experimental CBL ubiquitin ligase activity was in agreement with the predicted changes in CBL stability and	 to a lesser extent	 with CBL-E2 binding affinity. Two-thirds of all experimentally tested mutations affected the ubiquitin ligase activity by either destabilizing CBL or disrupting CBL-E2 binding	 whereas about one-third of tested mutations were found to be neutral. Collectively	 our findings demonstrate that computational methods incorporating multiple protein conformations and stability and binding affinity evaluations can successfully predict the functional consequences of cancer mutations on protein activity	 and provide a proof of concept for mutations in CBL.  Keywords: CBL	 driver mutations	 protein interactions Go to: Introduction Whole exome sequencing of cancer patients has produced unprecedented amounts of data to analyze and interpret; these studies report a very large fraction of missense mutations which can potentially be implicated in tumorigenensis (1). Although some missense mutations can provide selective growth advantage to tumor cells (driver mutations)	 the large majority of them are considered to be neutral (passenger mutations). The mechanisms by which the driver variants may affect protein stability	 interactions	 and function remain largely unknown. Various computational methods have been developed to estimate the impacts of disease mutations on proteins but most of them exclusively use sequence features and do not explicitly utilize the protein three-dimensional structures	 their physico-chemical properties and dynamics (2	 3). Many cancers are characterized by (de)activation of certain proteins which may be a result of missense mutations (4). The interconversion between active and inactive states is highly regulated in proteins and it is not well understood how these regulatory mechanisms are disrupted in cancer. The development of in silico approaches to estimate the effects of disease mutations on protein activity	 stability and binding will help to define which are likely to be driver or passenger mutations. Moreover	 understanding the mechanisms of their actions would allow for prioritization of potential driver candidates for better targeted therapies to design drugs which might in turn compensate for the reduced/enhanced protein stability or activity.  The monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) RING finger ubiquitin ligase (E3) represents an exceptionally difficult yet important system to study the mechanisms of cancer mutations (5	 6). Strikingly	 proteins from this family play both positive and negative regulatory roles in tyrosine kinase signaling which is aberrantly activated in many cancers (5). Oncogenic mutations in the c-Cbl gene (referred to as CBL thereafter) were found in human myeloid neoplasms and other tumors (5) but the significance of these mutations and their impacts on CBL function were studied only for very few mutants (7). The mechanistic aspects of CBL cancer mutations can now be adequately addressed as several CBL structures have become available which represent the snapshots of different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1). All CBL proteins share a highly conserved N-terminus which includes a tyrosine kinaseâ€“binding domain (TKBD)	 a linker helix region (LHR) and a RING finger domain	 while the C-terminus comprises a proline-rich region (8). The RING domain of CBL has E3 activity and ubiquitinates activated receptor tyrosine kinases which subsequently targets them for degradation (8). At the same time	 since CBL proteins can bind to activated receptor tyrosine kinases via the TKBD domain	 they can serve as adaptors by recruiting downstream signal transduction components such as SHP2 and P13K (9	 10).  Figure 1 Figure 1 CBL activation cycle. The structures representing the activation cycle of CBL are shown. In the inactive closed state (nCBL) the protein exists in the cytosol. Upon activation of the RTK	 CBL can bind to the phosphorylated RTK (orange peptide) via TKBD ... Another aspect of CBL function which should be accounted for in modeling the effects of cancer mutations is that it can bind to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) in complex with ubiquitin (Ub) and a substrate protein	 thereby facilitating the transfer of Ub from E2 to a lysine residue of the substrate (11). The crystal structure of the inactive complex of CBL with E2 (UbcH7) was solved more than ten years ago (12) while the active phosphorylated CBL-E2 (UbcH5B) complex was resolved fairly recently (13). According to the latter study	 substrate binding and Tyr371 phosphorylation activates CBL by producing a large conformational change in order to place the RING domain and E2 in close proximity to the substrate. It was further confirmed that phosphorylation-induced conformational change is required for positioning of ubiquitin for effective catalysis (14).  Here we present a new approach	 which aims to assess the effects of cancer mutations on stability	 binding and activity of cancer related proteins. We apply computational models to four different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1) and perform blind in vivo experiments of CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination. We show a rather remarkable agreement of experimental EGFR ubiquitination by CBL mutants with the computed changes in CBL thermodynamic stability and to a lesser extent with CBL-E2 binding affinity. The computational models not only quantitatively predict the magnitude of the effects of mutations but also shed light on the mechanisms of their action. Namely	 we find that cancer mutations have greater destabilizing effects on four CBL states than random non-cancer mutations for recurrent	 homozygous and leukemia mutations. Most damaging cancer mutations happen in the sites involved in Zn-coordination and in the formation of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds within CBL or between CBL and E2. Overall cancer driver mutations affect different or multiple stages of the CBL activation cycle either completely abolishing its E3 activity or partially attenuating it. The computational models based on stability and binding affinity calculations can discriminate experimentally validated driver from passenger mutations (with the exception of two mutations) and outperform several state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods aiming to predict phenotypic impacts of mutations.  Go to: Materials and Methods Computational modeling and analysis  Mapping of CBL mutations The COSMIC database (15) stores data on somatic cancer mutations and integrates the experimental data from full-genome sequencing studies. We extracted 103 missense mutations for the CBL gene from the COSMIC database (15) that could be mapped to four available CBL structures in its activation cycle (Fig. 1). Cancer mutations were classified into different classes according to the frequency of observed samples (single and recurrent mutations)	 zygosity (homo- and heterozygous mutations)	 types of cancer (leukemia and sarcoma) and the involvement of mutations in Zn-coordination (Table S1). In addition	 all possible single nucleotide substitutions resulting in amino-acid changes in the CBL gene were performed to obtain a â€œRandomâ€ missense mutation reference set. After excluding mutations observed in COSMIC and mutations occurring on residues without known coordinates in crystal structures	 we obtained 2	102 random missense mutations (Table S1). We also searched the dbSNP database (16) but found very few benign variations in the CBL gene. Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.  Model preparation We investigated the effects of mutations on four states of the CBL activation cycle: (1) closed CBL state (nCBL)	 (2) partially opened CBL state bound to substrate (CBL-S)	 (3) unphosphorylated autoinhibitory CBL bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and (4) phosphorylated CBL bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1). It was previously noted that both UbcH5B and UbcH7 can bind specifically to CBL but only UbcH5B can facilitate ubiquitination (17). The crystal structures of nCBL (PDB id: 2Y1M) (13)	 CBL-S (PDB id: 2Y1N) (13) and pCBL-E2-S (PDB id: 4A4C) (13) were obtained directly from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (18). Only one crystal structure of the unphosphorylated inactive state of CBL bound to E2 (UbcH7) and Zap-70 peptide (PDB id: 1FBV) (12) was available in PDB. Although sequence identity between UbcH7 and UbcH5B proteins is 38%	 the structural similarity is very high with the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.04 Ã…. The unphosphorylated autoinhibitory structure of CBL-UbcH5B-S was therefore modeled based on CBL-UbcH7-S (PDB id: 1FBV) using Chimera (19). (Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.)  Minimization procedure We applied our recently developed optimization protocol for minimizing wild-type and mutant structures (20). Heavy side chain atoms without known coordinates and hydrogen atoms were added to the crystal structures using the VMD (version 1.9.1) program (21) with models immersed into rectangular boxes of water molecules extending up to 10 Ã… from the protein in each direction. Wild-type protein complexes were minimized for 40	000 steps using explicit TIP3P water model. The final minimized models of wild-type protein complexes were used to produce all mutant structures and then an additional 300-step minimization for all mutant structures was performed. The energy minimization was carried out with the NAMD program (version 2.9) (22) using the CHARMM27 force field (23). For unfolding free energy calculations we applied the optimization procedure implemented in the RepairPDB module of the FoldX program (24) which optimizes the side chain configurations to provide a repaired structure. (See Supplementary Materials and Methods for more information.)  Binding and unfolding free energy calculations Binding free energy and effects of mutations on binding affinity were calculated according to the approach introduced by us earlier (20). Energy calculations were based on the modified MM-PBSA method that combined the molecular mechanics terms with the Poissonâ€“Boltzmann continuum representation of the solvent (25) and statistical scoring energy functions with parameters optimized on experimental sets of several thousand mutations (equation 3). Binding free energy calculations were performed on minimized wild-type and mutant structures of inactive CBL-E2-S and active pCBL-E2-S states. The binding energy is defined as a difference between the free energies of the complex and unbound proteins.  Î”Gbind=GCBL-E2-S-GCBL-S-GE2 (1) The change of binding energy due to a mutation can be calculated as:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î”Gbindmut-Î”GbindWT (2) The effect of mutations on binding affinity was calculated in this work using the following energy function:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î±Î”Î”Evdw+Î²Î”Î”Gsolv+Î³Î”SAmut+ÎµÎ”Î”GBM+Î»Î”Î”GFD+Î´ (3) Here Î”Î”Evdw is the change of the van der Waals interaction energy and Î”Î”Gsolv is the change of the polar solvation energy of solute in water. Î”SAmut represents a term proportional to the interface area of the mutant complex. Î”Î”GBM and Î”Î”GFD are the binding energy changes from BeAtMuSiC and FoldX	 respectively. BeAtMuSiC (26) estimates the effect of mutations on binding based on statistical potentials.  The FoldX software program (24) was used to estimate the unfolding free energy and to model the unfolding state. FoldX calculates the effects of mutations on protein stability using an empirical force field. The BuildModel module was used to introduce a mutation	 optimize the configurations of the neighboring side chains and calculate the difference in stability (unfolding free energy) between mutant ( Î”Gfoldmut) and repaired native structure ( Î”GfoldWT).  Î”Î”Gfold=Î”Gfoldmut-Î”GfoldWT (4) For comparison we used three alternative methods to predict the impacts of mutations on unfolding free energy: the Eris server (27)	 the Rosetta program (28) and the PoPMuSiC server (29). We also applied four additional webtools to assess the impacts of amino acid substitutions on CBL function: PROVEAN (30)	 PolyPhen-2 (31)	 MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). (See Supplementary Methods for more information.)  Go to: Experimental procedures Expression constructs  Human CBL cDNA was originally obtained from Wallace Langdon and subsequently cloned into the pCEFL expression plasmid (34). Point mutation constructs	 described above	 were created from wild-type CBL using the QuikChange II Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions (Stratagene	 La Jolla	 CA). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.  Cell culture and transfections  The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T	 the human nonsmall cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the human cervical cancer cell line HeLa used in this study were originally obtained from ATCC and maintained in culture using DMEM (Gibco	 Grand Island	 NY) supplemented with 10% FBS	 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin sulfate. Cell lines were authenticated by Short Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis by using either Promega Powerplex 16 (Promega	 Madison	 WI) or the AmpFISTR Identifier Kit (Life Technologies	 Carlsbad	 CA) and compared to the ATCC or DSMZ databases. HeLa cells were received in the lab in 2013 last authenticated on 7-30-15	 A549 were received in the lab in 2015 and last authenticated on 8-12-15	 and HEK293T were received in the lab in 1995 and last authenticated on 10-8-15.HEK293T cells were transfected using calcium phosphate according to the instructions accompanying the reagent (Profection; Promega Corp.	 Madison	 WI)	 incubated 18 h prior to media change and grown for a total of 48 h prior to harvesting. A549 and Hela cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen	 Carlsbad	 CA). Transfections were allowed to incubate 6 h prior to media change	 and cells were grown an additional 48 h before being harvested. Cells were starved for 4 hours and treated with EGF (100 ng/ul). Each cell-based experiment was repeated at least two times.  Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation  To harvest proteins	 cells were washed twice in ice-cold Dulbeccoâ€™s PBS-containing 200 Î¼M sodium orthovanadate (Fisher Chemicals	 Fairlawn	 NJ) then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5	 150 mM NaCl	 5 mM EDTA	 1% Triton X-100	 10% glycerol	 100 mM iodoacetamide [Sigma-Aldrich Corp.	 St. Louis	 MO]	 2 mM sodium orthovanadate	 and protease inhibitors [Complete tabsÂ®	 Roche Diagnostics Corp.	 Indianapolis	 IN]). All whole cell lysates were cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 16	000 Ã— g for 15 m at 4 Â°C. Supernatant protein concentrations were determined using the BioRad protein assay (BioRad	 Hercules	 CA). For immunoblotting	 20Î¼g of whole cell lysates were boiled in a 1:1 dilution of 2X loading buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8	 10% glycerol	 2% SDS	 1 mg/ml bromophenol blue	 0.3573 M Î²-mercaptoethanol) for 5 m. For immunoprecipitations	 150 Î¼g of each of the whole cell lysates were incubated with rabbit anti-EGFR (Ab-3; Millipore) and with Protein A/G+ agarose beads (sc-2003; Santa Cruz Biotechnology	 Santa Cruz	 CA). All immunoprecipitations were incubated overnight at 4Â°C with tumbling. Immune complexes were washed five times in 1 mL cold lysis buffer	 then resuspended in 2X loading buffer	 boiled for 5 m	 then resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran BA85; Whatman	 Sanford	 MA). For immunoblot detection of proteins	 the following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-EGFR (2232L; Cell Signaling)	 rat monoclonal high affinity anti-HA-peroxidase	 (clone 3F10; Roche)	 rabbit anti-Cbl (sc-C-15; Santa Cruz) and mouse anti-Hsc70 (sc-7298; Santa Cruz). Horseradish peroxidase linked donkey anti-rabbit IgG (NA934V; GE Healthcare	 Piscataway	 NJ)	 or donkey anti-mouse IgG (NA931: GE Healthcare	 Piscataway	 NJ) immunoglobulin was used with SuperSignal (Pierce Biotechnology Inc.	 Rockford	 IL) to visualize protein detection.  Densitometric Analysis  Immunoblots were developed on HyBlot CL Autoradiography Film (Denville Scientific Inc.	 South Plainfield	 NJ) with an X-OMAT automated processor (Eastman Kodak	 Rochester	 NY). Protein expression levels were then recorded using an Epson Perfection V750 PRO scanner (Epson Inc.	 Long Beach	 CA) and densitometric analysis was performed using Adobe Photoshop software version 7.0 (Adobe Systems Inc.	 U.S.A). EGFR ubiquitination signal intensity was determined by optical density in a set area normalized against the EGFR band intensity in parallel immunoblots and expressed as a densitometric ratio of ubiquitination/EGFR levels. The mean densitometric ratio of EGFR ubiquitination	 in the presence of each CBL mutation	 was then assessed relative to wild-type CBL where the ratio was set at 1.0.  Go to: Results Cancer mutations impact CBL stability  We estimated the thermodynamic stability (unfolding free energy) changes	 Î”Î”Gfold	 upon mutation for closed (nCBL) and partially opened (CBL-S) CBL states (Fig. 1). These states did not involve binding to E2. The examination of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for random non-cancer mutations (Fig. 2A) showed that it was very similar to experimental distributions produced by random mutagenesis on a set of different proteins (35	 36). Namely	 the distribution for random non-cancer mutations was asymmetrically centered at positive energy values and there were about 10% of random mutations with highly damaging effects on CBL structures by more than 5 kcal molâˆ’1 (Fig. 2A). Despite the presence of highly damaging random mutations	 recurrent cancer mutations overall produced significantly larger destabilizing effects compared to random (p-value â‰ª 0.01) for both nCBL and CBL-S states (Fig. 2A and S1	 Table S2). This was not the case for single cancer mutations observed in only one patient (Table S2). Overall	 the form of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for recurrent cancer mutations was different from the Î”Î”Gfold distribution of random mutations (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p-value â‰ª 0.01) whereas the distribution for single cancer mutations was indistinguishable from a random mutation distribution. However	 it does not mean that all single cancer mutants can be considered passenger	 as we show later	 this is not the case for some of them.  Figure 2 Figure 2 (A) The distribution of unfolding (Î”Î”Gfold) and binding (Î”Î”Gbind) free energy changes for Single	 Recurrent and Random class mutations on nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states (see SI for other states). Positive and negative values ... The top 25% cancer mutations with the largest damaging effects are presented in Table S3. Many of them occurred in Zn-coordinating sites while many others did not involve Zn-coordination sites. Some of these latter mutations (G415V	 G413R and G415S) introduced large Van der Waals clashes with neighboring residues which could not be accommodated by side chain rearrangements	 whereas other mutations (S376F	 Y371D and L405P) affected disulfide or hydrogen bonds. For example	 L405P located in the middle of an Î±-helix affected the CBL structure by introducing an energetically unfavorable kink in the helix due to its inability to donate an amide hydrogen bond.  Effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding  The outcome of mutations can be assessed by the extent of structural changes they induce. We calculated the local root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between the minimized wild-type and mutant structures around the mutated site. We found that the protein backbone in the vicinity of a mutation of the CBL-E2 complex underwent larger local conformational changes upon recurrent cancer mutations	 especially for mutations occurring in Zn-coordinating site clusters	 compared to random mutations (p-value â‰ª 0.01	 Fig. S2 and S3). In the previous section we analyzed the original closed (nCBL) state and partially opened (CBL-S) state induced by substrate binding. In this section we study the effects of cancer mutations on two other CBL states: an autoinhibitory CBL state bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and phosphorylated active CBL state bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1) (13). Effects of mutations on binding can be in general linked with their structural locations	 therefore we examined the locations of mutations and found that about one third of all cancer mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface (Fig. S4). This preference was found to be statistically significant (p-value â‰ª 0.01) (Fig. S4).  It was previously experimentally shown that binding between CBL and E2 was rather weak with a micromolar dissociation constant (13). Despite the fact that the interface between CBL and E2 in the inactive state is several residues larger than in the active state	 consistent with experiments	 we found somewhat stronger binding between CBL and E2 for the active state of CBL (Table S4). Similarly to the impacts of cancer mutations on stability	 recurrent (but not single) mutations destabilized CBL-E2 binding significantly (Fig. 2B	 S1 and Table S2). Importantly	 cancer mutations reduced the CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state (p-value = 0.002) (Fig. 2B) and the effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding of the active state were noticeably larger compared to random mutations even if we excluded mutations in Zn-coordinating sites (Table S2). This latter observation does not hold true for the autoinhibitory CBL-E2-S conformation.  Next	 all cancer mutations were ranked with respect to their effects on CBL-E2 binding. About half of all highly damaging mutations (top 25% of most damaging mutations	 Table S3) impacted both stability and CBL-E2 binding for all four CBL states. Among them	 several mutations occurred in Zn-coordinating clusters and M400 and L405 sites. Another class of mutations (involving W408 and R420 sites) mostly influenced CBL-E2 binding. For example	 the W408S mutation caused the largest perturbation in CBL-E2 binding of the active state by decreasing binding affinity up to 3.5 kcal molâˆ’1 but having a moderate effect on stability of the nCBL and CBL-S states. It was previously suggested that amino acids in positions W408 and I383 constituted specificity of CBL-E2 binding and corresponded to binding hot spots (10	 12). Mutations in the I383 site are not recorded in the COSMIC database although they have a profound destabilizing effect on CBL-E2 binding for both states (see data for random mutations on the ftp site ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/panch/CBL). Another site affecting binding of CBL (R420) is a highly conserved site in the CBL family	 it strongly interacts with the Q92	 W93 and S94 residues of E2. It was previously experimentally verified that mutations in this site disrupted the CBL activity and could be associated with cytokine-independent growth (37). There are 24 cancer patient samples where mutations of this site (R420Q	 R420L and R420P) are found and they all produce strong destabilizing effects on the active pCBL-E2-S state.  According to the zygosity annotation	 there are 49 heterozygous (â€œHeteroâ€) and 27 homozygous (â€œHomoâ€) mutations (Table S1) and for the rest of cancer mutations their zygocity status is undetermined. Overall	 we found that destabilizing mutations were enriched among homozygous compared to heterozygous mutations for all stages of CBL activation cycle (p-value = 0.021 â€“ 0.035) and were more prevalent in leukemia compared to sarcoma patients (p-value = 0.000 â€“ 0.003) (Fig. 2B	 Table S2). This observation could not be attributed to the prevalence of homozygous mutations in Zn-coordinating clusters since these clusters had almost equal numbers of heterozygous and homozygous mutations. It was reported earlier that many homozygous mutations could be connected to uniparental disomy when germline heterozygosity would lead to neoplasia upon reduction to homozygosity (6	38	 39). If some patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms had germline heterozygous mutations in CBL	 then lost the wild-type CBL allele and duplicated mutant allele	 it would be possible that the damaging mutant allele would be duplicated in a cancer cell with a higher probability. Indeed	 human leukemia samples show the loss of the normal CBL allele.  CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination: comparing experiments with computational models  Next we randomly picked fifteen cancer mutations based on their predicted damaging status	 trying to equally sample highly damaging and benign mutations irrespective to their frequencies in cancer samples	 and experimentally tested the E3 activity of wild-type and mutant CBL proteins (see Methods	 Table 1). As can be seen in Fig. 3A	 in the presence of wild-type CBL	 activation of the EGFR induced more than a 10-fold increase in the ubiquitination of the EGFR compared to empty vector (endogenous CBL levels) in HEK293T cells (compare lane 4 to lane 2 in top panel of Fig. 3A). The E3 activity of wild-type CBL was mirrored by a decrease in the levels of immunoprecipitated EGFR consistent with the targeting of ubiquitinated EGFR for degradation (compare lanes 2 and 4 in second panel of Fig. 3A).  Figure 3 Figure 3 (A) EGFR ubiquitination. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant CBL proteins along with the EGFR and hemagglutinin (HA)-epitope tagged ubiquitin. The vector control and wild-type	 CBL transfectant cells were incubated ... Table 1 Table 1 Experimental relative densitometry values for HEK293T cells	 predicted changes in stability (Î”Î”Gfold kcal molâˆ’1)	 binding affinity (Î”Î”Gbind kcal molâˆ’1) and comparison with other methods for 15 experimentally ... We classified all mutations into three groups (damaging	 attenuating and benign) according to their experimental relative densitometry data and compared experimental data with the estimates produced by the computational models. The first group of damaging mutants included C396R	 H398Q	 Y371H	 K382E and C381A which completely abolished CBL activity (relative densitometry was less than 10%) (Fig. 3B) and the levels of total EGFR were not decreased by these mutants (Fig. 3A). Only two of these mutants belonged to the Recurrent class of mutations. Table 1 shows predicted and experimentally verified effects of mutations on all four CBL states. All five mutants were predicted to be damaging by stability and binding affinity calculations but the mechanisms of their action were different. C396R	 H398Q and C381A mutations disrupted Zn-coordinating clusters and had very damaging consequences according to the stability model for both nCBL and CBL-S states and damaging effects on CBL-E2 binding even though none of these mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface. On the other hand	 the K382E mutation did not affect Zn-coordination but destabilized the nCBL state. This	 in turn	 could be explained by the charge substitution that led to the disruption of the K382-E373 salt bridge within the closed state of nCBL (Figure 4 and Figure S5A). Moreover	 K382E mutation had a significant impact on CBL-E2 binding due to the disruption of a salt bridge between pY371 and K382 affecting the stability of CBL in the active state (Figure 4 and Figure S5D). No significant changes were observed for CBL-S and CBL-E2-S states (Figure S5B	C). K382E mutation was previously observed in Noonan syndrome and was speculated to affect CBL stability or binding (40). Finally	 the Y371H mutation not only abolished phosphorylation at the Y371 site but also had a profound destabilizing effect on all four states as evident from Table 1.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Structures of wild type (green) and K382E mutant (tan) are shown for nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states. Salt bridges are shown as dashed lines and in both cases mutation affects the stability by disrupting the salt bridge. The second group of mutants (M374V	 V430M	 P428L	 Q249E and double mutant S80N/H94Y) maintained the CBL activity equivalent to or greater than wild-type CBL (relative densitometry of 80% or higher) (Fig. 3B). Consistent with this	 the levels of the activated EGFR were also decreased in these samples (Fig. 3A). To confirm that the retained E3 activity of these mutants was not cell type specific	 we transfected these mutants into the non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the cervical cancer cell line Hela (Fig. S6). The S80N/H94Y and Q249E mutations were previously identified in human non-small cell lung cancers making the A549 cell line a relevant cell type to investigate the function of these CBL mutants while other cancer mutations were found in other cancer types. As in the HEK293T cells	 transfection of wild-type CBL into A549 and HeLa cells resulted in a significant increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of EGFR compared to the cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. S6). The increase in transfected CBL protein compared to endogenous CBL protein was less in HeLa than in either the A549 or HEK293T cells. Consistent with this	 the fold increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of the EGFR by wild-type CBL was smaller in Hela cells (about three fold) compared to either A549 or HEK293T cells (more than 10 fold in each). As in HEK293T cells	 the Y371H mutant did not stimulate ubiquitination compared to the vector transfected control for A549 or HeLa cells (Fig. S6A and C). The CBL mutants that were fully active in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3A and B) maintained CBL E3 activity in A549 and HeLa cells (Fig. S6). Two of these CBL mutants resulted in more ubiquitination of EGFR compared to wild type CBL. For example	 the Q249E mutant showed an increased ubiquitination of EGFR in 293T and HeLa cells while the M374V mutant resulted in higher ubiquitination levels in A549 and HeLa cells (Figure 3 and S6). Only V430M mutant was on the borderline with the densitometry ratio of 0.8. All mutations from the second group were predicted to be benign according to our computational models	 whereas V430M	 consistent with experimental data	 had a borderline destabilizing impact on CBL-E2 binding (Table 1).  Finally	 the third group constituted mutations (L399V	 G375P	 P395A and V391I) which attenuated the CBL E3 activity according to the relative densitometry data (Fig. 3B). Only one of these mutants was observed in two cancer samples while other three belonged to the Single mutation class. Concordant with this	 there were intermediate levels of EGFR (Fig. 3A). G375P and P395A mutations were predicted to have partially damaging effects while V391I and L399V were classified as benign in our predictions. Interestingly	 mutations from this third group affected only some of the CBL states. In contrast	 the highly damaging mutations from the first group had damaging impacts on almost all CBL states.  Next we tested if the reduction in CBL ubiquitination activity was directly correlated with the effects of mutations on stability (Fig. 5A). The relationship between experimental densitometry data and Î”Î”Gfold was better described by an exponential dependence with correlation coefficient (R) of 0.77 and 0.78 for CBL-S and nCBL states respectively (Table S5). Indeed	 the change in absorption between wild-type and mutant proteins which refers to a fraction of active mutants can be described by the Boltzmann equation relating the probability of a state with the energy of this state. A mutation may lead to damaging effects and a loss of function if it impacts at least one of the CBL functional states. Taking this into consideration we calculated the correlation between densitometry and stability changes taking a maximum of Î”Î”Gfold values for the nCBL and CBL-S states. As shown in Fig. 5A and Table S5	 changes in stability can indeed explain the effects of mutations on CBL ubiquitination activity with high correlation of R = 0.83. For comparison	 several alternative methods were applied to predict the effect of mutations on unfolding free energy	 they all reported correlation coefficients ranging from 0.21 to 0.52	 with only one method PopMusic reporting a statistically significant correlation of 0.52 (Table S5). The relationship between densitometry and binding affinity changes was on the borderline of significance with a linear correlation coefficient of 0.48 and 0.62 (if two highly damaging mutations were excluded) (Fig. 5B and Table S5).  Figure 5 Figure 5 (A) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (exponential model) and maximal predicted changes in stability. (B) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (linear model) and predicted changes in binding affinity of pCBL-E2-S state. ... There are various methods which predict the phenotypic effects of mutations	 (30â€“33	 41) and some of them use structural features (31	 41). We applied four state-of-the-art independent methods to predict the impacts of mutations on CBL function: PROVEAN (30)	 PolyPhen-2 (31)	 MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). Some of these methods outperformed our model in classifying cancer from random mutations since they were trained to distinguish disease from neutral variants (Table S6). However	 all four methods had a very limited accuracy in classifying CBL cancer mutations into those that disrupted function and those that did not. As evident from Table 1 and Table S5	 all methods except for PROVEAN over-predicted damaging effects of experimentally tested mutations while PROVEAN was the only method which produced a significant correlation between the densitometry data and PROVEANâ€™s score (R=0.58	 Table S5).  Go to: Discussion Stability-activity balance in cancer related proteins  Evolutionary selection to maintain structural	 foldable and functional proteins eliminates many mutations in protein sequences. On the other hand	 thermodynamic stability can be compromised in evolution to ensure certain arrangements of catalytic and binding sites	 which might not be energetically optimal (36	 42). In tumorigenesis	 protein stability or binding may be reduced (or in some cases increased) due to cancer mutations. As a consequence it can lead to decreased fitness at the protein level	 but may confer a fitness advantage for the population of tumor cells (43	 44). However	 the extent of the stability-activity tradeoff in oncogenes and tumor suppressors remains largely unknown. Using the example of the CBL protein	 here we tried to elucidate the stability-activity balance and to understand whether the loss or gain of activity in cancer-related proteins can be accompanied by compromised stability or binding.  In contrast to many other computational studies	 which attempt to link stability with activity by mostly focusing on one protein conformation	 we performed an analysis on four different stages of the CBL activation cycle. Our predictions of changes in stability and binding were further elucidated by the experimental CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays. We found a strong relationship between the effects of mutations on CBL stability and experimentally obtained densitometry data (quantifying activity)	 while a relatively weaker correlation was observed between changes in densitometry and CBL-E2 binding affinity. It could be explained either by a less significant impact of experimentally tested mutations on CBL-E2 binding or by a limited coupling (compared to CBL stability) between CBL-E2 binding and E3 activity.  Drivers or passengers?  According to our study	 about two thirds of all experimentally tested mutations either completely abolished or attenuated E3 activity	 while one third of them were neutral. Trying to assess the limitations of our models	 we applied state-of- the-art methods commonly used to predict functional effects of mutations. However	 these methods failed to distinguish inactivating from neutral mutations as accurately as the computational models which were solely based on accounting for the effects on stability and binding for different CBL states. Indeed	 many methods are not specifically designed to discriminate driver from passenger mutations within the pool of cancer mutations	 but rather they perform a task of distinguishing cancer from neutral mutations.  Certainly	 the large majority of all mutations detected in cancer genomics studies are likely to be neutral although the collective burden of passenger mutations may also alter the course of tumorigenesis (45). When we analyzed the distribution of all single cancer missense mutations observed in the CBL gene	 their average effects on stability or binding were not found to be significantly different from the pool of random mutations. These mutations either mostly constitute true passenger mutations or their oncogenic mechanisms are not directly connected to protein destabilization. The story is quite the opposite for the recurrent mutations as they have on average significantly higher destabilizing effects than random mutations and the majority of them should be drivers. An interesting group of mutations includes those which are highly damaging but found only in one cancer sample (10% of all single cancer mutations). These mutations may represent either rare driver or latent driver mutations (46). Several of these mutations were experimentally tested and are listed in Table 1.  CBL-E2 binding in deciphering the mechanisms of cancer  Our analysis showed that cancer mutations reduce CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state. It is in contrast to the stability-activity tradeoff reported for EGFR and other cancer related proteins (47)	 where cancer mutations may disrupt autoinhibitory interactions and activate the kinase (48	 49). Importantly	 all mutations with experimentally tested high inactivating effects have impacts on both CBL stability and CBL-E2 binding (Table 1). In fact	 the correlation between Î”Î”Gfold and Î”Î”Gbind for CBL cancer mutations from COSMIC is positive (R = 0.20 â€“ 0.48 depending on the CBL state	 p-value < 0.05). It might seem counterintuitive as some residues maintain stability by sustaining the RING-TKBD autoinhibitory interactions within CBL. This interface overlaps with the CBL-E2 interface and competes against E2 binding (13). One might think that disruption of RING-TKBD interactions and destabilization of CBL might facilitate binding to E2 and therefore lead to CBL activation. A slight activation was actually observed for two mutants	 one of which (M374V) was directly located on the CBL-E2 interface. However	 as we showed through the positive high correlation between stability and activity changes	 this mechanism is rarely observed and the vast majority of mutations disrupt CBL-E3 activity by either destabilizing CBL and/or CBL-E2 binding or by directly affecting phosphorylation of the critical tyrosine Y371.  Overall	 our results support the idea that decrease of E3 activity	 of the ability to ubiquitinate receptor tyrosine kinases	 of CBL stability and/or CBL-E2 binding can give a selective advantage for tumor cells. However	 there are several factors that complicate deciphering the mechanisms of action of CBL cancer mutations. CBL mutations can be dominant-negative and mutated CBL might not only change the CBL E3 activity but also might affect the concentration and activity of the wild-type CBL. According to a ratiometric method to identify driver genes in cancer (1)	 CBL can be regarded as an oncogene since it has several mutation hot spots. On the other hand	 as shown in our study and in other studies	 cancer driver mutations can inactivate the E3 activity of CBL	 so it can also be regarded as a tumor suppressor. Although the latter fact complicates the development of CBL targeted therapies	 understanding the delicate balance among different CBL-affected pathways may facilitate the indirect drug targeting of damaged CBL proteins. The current genetics-based frameworks to analyze cancer genome-wide sequence data are necessary but not sufficient for understanding the processes of carcinogenesis and developing informed	 targeted therapies. Our approach	 which can be applied in general to different proteins of interest	 emphasizes the importance of the physics of binding and protein conformational ensembles in deducing the mechanisms of cancer.  																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			
1	7||CBL is a negative regulator of activated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK). In this study	 we determined the frequency of CBL mutations in acute leukemias and evaluated the oncogenic potential of mutant CBL. Experimental Design: The cDNA of 300 acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients and 82 human leukemic cell lines was screened for aberrations in the linker and RING finger domain of CBL. The oncogenic potential of identified mutants was evaluated in hematopoietic cells. Results:We identified 3 of 279 AML/MDS patients expressingCBL exon 8/9 deletion mutants. Three of four cases at diagnosis expressed deleted transcripts missing exon 8 or exon 8/9. In remission samples a weak or no expression of mutant CBL was detected. No aberrations were found in normal hematopoietic tissues. One of 116 sequenced AML/MDS cases carried a R420G missense mutation. All AML/MDS patients with identified CBL mutants belonged to the core bindingfactor and 11q deletion AML subtypes. Functionally	 CBL negatively regulated FMSlike tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) activity and interacted with human FLT3 via the autophosphorylation sitesY589 andY599 and colocalized in vivo. Expression of CBLDexon8 and CBLDexon8+9 in FLT3-WT-Ba/F3 cells induced growth factor ^ independent proliferation associated with autophosphorylation of FLT3 and activated the downstream targets signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) and protein kinase B (AKT). FLT3 ligand ^ dependent hyperproliferation of CBL mutant cells could be abrogated by treatment with the FLT3 PTK inhibitor PKC412 (midostaurin). Conclusion: CBL exon8/9 mutants occur in genetically defined AML/MDS subtypes and transform hematopoietic cells by constitutively activatingthe FLT3 pathway. This phenotype resembles the one of mutated RTKs and suggests that CBL mutant AML patients might benefit from treatment with FLT3 PTK inhibitors. CBL	 a known negative regulator of activated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK)	 is localized on human chromosome 11q23	 a region frequently associated with chromosomal aberrations. Translocations t(4;11) and t(11;14)	 and mixed-lineage leukemia fusion genes involving CBL have been described in patients with leukemia and lymphoma (1â€“3). CBL oncogenes were initially identified in the murine system. CBL-70Z	 carrying an internal deletion of 17 amino acids	 was isolated from the 70Z/ 3 mouse pre-B-cell lymphoma cell line (4). CBL-70Z deregulates the cellular tyrosine kinase machinery	 as NIH3T3 serumstarved cells expressing CBL-70Z showed significantly increased endothelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase activity after EGF stimulation (5). p95CBL	 expressed in the murine reticulum sarcoma cell line J-774	 lacks internal 111 amino acids	 comprising whole exons 8 and 9 (6). CBL70Z and p95CBL mutations both target the linker and RING finger domain	 which points to a mutation-sensitive region within the CBL protein. Recently the first human CBL mutation has been reported in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML; ref. 7).

Â© 2009 American Association for Cancer in the RING finger domain (8	 9) and was shown to inhibit FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) internalization and ubiquitylation (7). Additional screenings of AML patients revealed more cases with CBL mutations	 including internal deletions of exon 8 and point mutations targeting G375 (10	 11). Activating FLT3 mutations represent one of the most common genetic alterations in AML and are associated with a poor prognosis (12). Overexpression of wild-type FLT3 (FLT3-WT) has been shown to synergize with other oncogenic fusions to induce aggressive AML in mice (13). Because of these reasons	 FLT3 is a prominent target for therapeutic intervention. Currently two compounds targeting FLT3 kinase activity	 PKC412 (midostaurin) and CEP701(lestaurtinib)	 have reached clinical phase III (14). As patients that do not carry activating FLT3 mutations benefit from treatment with FLT3 inhibitors (15)	 we hypothesized that other mechanisms	 such as CBL mutations	 might contribute to the oncogenic potential of FLT3. Here	 we report a frequency of 1.1% of CBL exon8/9 mutations in AML/ myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Three of the four newly diagnosed AML/MDS patients expressed CBL lacking exon 8 or exon 8/9 and one patient carried a R420G missense mutation. Aberrant CBL transcripts were lost in remission samples. CBL is part of the human FLT3 downstream signaling pathway and promoted down-regulation of FLT3 activity. Finally	 CBL deletion mutants CBLDExon8 and CBL exon8/9 transformed Ba/F3 cells in the presence	 but not in the absence of FLT3-WT. Materials and Methods Analysis of cell lines and patient samples.

Each proliferation experiment was carried out at least three times independently. TaqMan PCR analysis. Quantification of CBL expression in Ba/F3 cells was analyzed by real-time quantitative-PCR with primers from Applied Biosystems as described previously (18). Translational Relevance In this article we provide detailed insight into the role of oncogenic CBL exon8/9 mutations in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)	 but we could not find CBL mutations in our acute lymphoblastic leukemia cohort. Analysis of a large cohort of AML/MDS patients of different cytogenetic subgroups revealed an overall low frequency of CBL exon 8+9 deletions of 1.1%. However	 we identified preferential association of CBL exon8/9 mutations with core bindingfactor leukemias and 11q aberrations. We describe that all known human CBL deletion mutants lead to transformation of wild-type FLT3 ^ expressing hematopoietic cells. This phenotype resembles that seen with activated receptor tyrosine kinases. Therefore	 it is of particular note that analysis of CBL should be introduced in routine leukemia diagnostics	 as patients who harbor CBL mutations might benefit from treatment with FLT3 protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

Results A subset of AML/MDS patients carries mutations in the protooncogene CBL. Recent reports have indicated a putative contribution of CBL mutations to the pathogenesis of human leukemias (7	 10). To obtain a comprehensive insight into the role of CBL in human acute leukemias	 we firstly did a PCR screening of the cDNA of 61AML and 21acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines (Table 1; Supplementary Table S1) for deletions in the linker and RING finger domains. We identified a monoallelic CBL deletion transcript in the AML cell line MOLM-13 and the sister cell line MOLM-14. Sequencing of the aberrant transcripts revealed loss of the complete coding sequence of exon 8. All other analyzed cell lines expressed exclusively wild-type CBL (CBL-WT). Secondly	 we used the above PCR screening assay to analyze a well-characterized cohort of AML/MDS and ALL patient samples for the presence of aberrant CBL transcripts (Table 1A). Among 279 AML samples of different cytogenetic subtypes and 21T-cell ALL samples we detected three AML/MDS patients expressing CBLWT as well as an aberrant CBL transcript (Table 1B). Patient 1 with a t(8;21) (AML1/ETO positive) and patient 2 with an 11q deletion both expressed a CBL transcript lacking exon 8	 and patient 3 with an inv(16) (CBFB/MYH11 positive) expressed CBL lacking exon 8 and 9 (Table 1B; Fig. 1A). By PCR fragment analysis we determined the relative expression of mutant versus CBL-WT. For patient 1we detected 40% mutant versus 60% wild-type transcript. For patient 2 a 20% mutant versus 80% wild-type transcript was observed	 supposedly due to the low blast count (20%) in the patient sample. Patient 3 showed equal ratios of mutant versus wild-type transcripts (data not shown). To verify that the shorter CBL transcripts were expressed in the malignant cell population	 we analyzed remission samples in the case of patients 1and 3. Conventional PCR screening of remission samples from patient 1showed a weak expression of the transcript lacking exon 8 (Fig. 1B). PCR fragment analysis revealed that still 15% to 20% of the mutant CBL was present in the remission sample (data not shown). In case of patient 3 the PCR screening as well as the fragment analysis showed loss of the mutant CBL transcript lacking exon 8 and 9 in remission. To exclude the possibility of normally occurring splice variants	 we analyzed the cDNA of normal human hematopoietic tissues	 in detail normal bone marrow	 peripheral leukocytes	 spleen	 and thymus. All of the analyzed tissues expressed exclusively CBL-WT transcripts (data not shown). In addition to the PCR screening	 a subset of 116 PCR products from AML/MDS patients of all subtypes were analyzed by nucleotide sequencing comprising the region of exon 7	 8 and 9. One AML/MDS patient with an 11q aberration showed a substitution of arginine to glycine at position 420	 which is located in the RING finger domain (Table 1B	 Fig. 1A). In summary	 we identified 2 of 61AML cell lines [3.3% (0.4%	 11.3%)] and 3 of 279 (1.1%) AML/MDS patients expressing aberrant CBL transcripts deleted in the linker and RING finger domains of CBL. Aberrant CBL transcripts could not be detected in any of the analyzed ALL cell lines and ALL patient samples. A murine CBL deletion transcript has been described in the 70Z/3 B-cell lymphoma cell line (CBL-70Z lacking the first 17 amino acids of exon 8; ref. 4). In the 70Z/3 line the causative event is a splice site mutation	 changing the splice acceptor site AG to CG	 generating an alternative splice site	 which excludes the first 17 amino acids of exon 8 (Fig. 1A). Analysis of the genomic DNA of MOLM-13 cells detected a deletion of 14 nucleotides at the exon 8/intron 8 boundary eliminating a Table 1. A.

Two patients belong to CBF leukemias [t(8;21); inv(16)] and two patients harbor 11q aberrations. *A detailed listing of all cell lines is given in Supplementary Table 1.

Â© 2009 American Association for Cancer splicing element leading to expression of the CBLDexon8 mutant (data not shown)	 as had been described previously (10). By amplifying a 8	050-bp fragment of genomic DNA spanning intron 6 to exon 11 and subsequent nucleotide sequencing	 we detected mutations in all three patients expressing aberrant CBL transcripts (data not shown). One allele of patient 1(CBLDexon8) harbored a deletion of 43 nucleotides at the exon 8-intron 8 boundary	 including the last 36 nucleotides of exon 8 and the first 7 nucleotides of intron 8	 thereby losing the whole splice donor site of intron 8. Analysis of the genomic DNA of patient 2 (CBLDexon8) revealed a point mutation of the splice donor site of intron 8	 changing the conserved â€˜â€˜GTâ€™â€™ to â€˜â€˜GCâ€™â€™ in about 10% of the amplified DNA. The sample from patient 2 contained only 20% blasts	 suggesting that this mutation occurred in one of the CBL alleles of the malignant clone. Patient 3 (CBLDexon8+9) carries a monoallelic large genomic deletion of 1	680 nucleotides	 starting in intron 7 and ending in intron 9 leading to the loss of exon 8 and 9. In conclusion	 all CBL transcripts	 which lack whole exons	 can be explained by genomic events that target splice donor or acceptor sites by mutations or deletions. CBL interacts with the FLT3 receptor and contributes to FLT3 downstream signaling. As CBL is known to be involved in the signal transduction of class III RTKs	 platelet-derived growth factor receptor A (PDGFRA)	 FMS (colony forming growth factor 1 receptor)	 and KIT (stem cell factor receptor) (19â€“ 21)	 we hypothesized that CBL mutants might play a role in human FLT3 downstream signaling. Lysates of FLT3-WT expressing Ba/ F3 cells with or without FLT3 ligand stimulation were analyzed for the phosphorylation status of endogenous CBL. We could show that activation of human FLT3 after binding of FLT3 ligand leads to high levels of phosphorylated CBL in FLT3-WTâ€“ expressing cells	 whereas the kinase-dead mutant receptor (FLT3-R644K) cells do not show phosphorylated CBL (Fig. 2A). To localize the interaction site within the FLT3-WT receptor we substituted two essential in vivo autophosphorylation sites of FLT3	 tyrosines Y589 and Y599 (22)	 with phenylalanine. FLT3Y589F and FLT3Y599F receptorâ€“expressing cells show a remarkable decrease of CBL phosphorylation after FLT3 ligand stimulation compared with FLT3-WT â€“ expressing cells (Fig. 2A). We conclude that Y589 and Y599 participate in the interaction of the FLT3 receptor with CBL. To detect interaction of FLT3 and CBL	 we did coimmunoprecipitation experiments with lysates from FLT3 ligand â€“ stimulated cells expressing V5-tagged FLT3-WT alone or together with CBLWT or CBL-70Z. Figure 2B shows that CBL-WT and CBL-70Z	 interact with the FLT3 receptor. The FLT3 receptor is generally detected as two distinct bands	 the mature glycosylated form at 155 kDa and the immature cytoplasmic form at 130 kDa (23). The interaction between CBL-WT and CBL-70Z with FLT3 occurred predominantly with the mature form of FLT3 (higher band). To study the interaction between the FLT3 receptor and CBL at the cellular level	 we did in vivo colocalization experiments using immunofluorescence of FLT3 and CBL-WT. In U2OS human osteosarcoma cells transiently transfected FLT3 localizes to the cell membrane and the cytoplasm (Fig. 2C). In the cytoplasm FLT3 accumulates in the perinuclear endoplasmatic reticulum	 consistent with recent reports (24). CBL shows a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution. Stimulation of the cells with FLT3 ligand results in internalization of FLT3	 which is indicated by loss of FLT3 staining in the cell membrane and formation of endosomal vesicles. Upon addition of FLT3 ligand	 CBL clearly colocalizes with internalized FLT3 in the endosomal vesicles. CBL regulates the function of EGFR via ubiquitin-dependent degradation of EGFR (25	 26). Therefore	 we sought to investigate if CBL negatively regulates human FLT3. Two hundred and ninety-three cells were transiently transfected with FLT3-WT alone or FLT3-WT and CBL-WT and stimulated with FLT3 ligand for different time periods. Lysates were analyzed for FLT3 phosphorylation and total levels of FLT3 protein. Figure 2D shows constant phosphorylation and levels of FLT3 protein in FLT3-WTâ€“ transfected cells up to 120 minutes	 Fig. 1. Identified CBL mutants in AML patients. Aberrant CBL transcripts are lost in remission.

Â© 2009 American Association for Cancer whereas the phospho-tyrosine signal is comparably less in double-transfected cells after 60 minutes and barely detectable after 120 minutes. The total protein levels of FLT3 are significantly reduced after 90 minutes of FLT3 ligand stimulation in the double-transfected cells compared with FLT3-WT â€“ transfected cells	 implicating an enhanced degradation of FLT3 by CBL. CBL mutants confer a transforming potential to Ba/F3 cells expressing FLT3-WT. In light of the direct interaction between FLT3 and CBL and the modulation of FLT3 signaling by CBL	 we hypothesized that CBL mutants could activate the oncogenic potential of FLT3-WT in AML blasts. The following CBL mutants found in AML/MDS patients and leukemic cell lines	 CBLDexon8	 CBLDexon8+9 and CBLR420 and CBLG375 point mutants	 as well as CBL-WT and CBL-70Z as a positive control	 were generated and subcloned into MSCVGFP. FLT3-WT was subcloned into MSCV-YFP vector. All CBL constructs were stably expressed alone or together with FLT3- WT in Ba/F3 cells. Positive selection was done by fluorescenceactivated cell sorting. The expression of transduced human CBL in FLT3-WT/CBL coexpressing cells was higher than the expression of endogenous CBL	 as analyzed by real time quantitative-PCR (Supplementary Fig. S1A) and verified by Western Blot analysis for the CBLDexon8+9 mutant (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Expression of any single CBL construct alone or coexpression of CBL-WT and FLT3-WT did not confer growth factor independent proliferation to Ba/F3 cells (data not shown). However	 coexpression of CBL-70Z	 CBLDexon8 or CBLDexon8+9 with FLT3-WT led to significant IL-3 independent proliferation (Fig. 3A). Compared with the CBL deletion mutants	 expression of CBL R420G	 R420Q	 G375S	 and G375P point mutants did not confer any proliferative capacity	 but enhanced cell survival	 as 50% of cells survived for 3 days after IL-3 withdrawal compared with 10% survival of the control cells (data not shown). The presence of FLT3 ligand induced a strong dosedependent proliferation of FLT3-WT/CBL-70Z	 FLT3-WT/ CBLDexon8	 and FLT3-WT/CBLDexon8+9 cotransduced cells Fig. 2.

B	 293 cells were transfected with MIY (control)	V5-tagged FLT3-WT CBL-WTorV5-tagged FLT3-WT CBL-70Z and stimulated with 100 ng/mL FLT3 ligand for 5 min.

Â© 2009 American Association for Cancer with a proliferation rate about 4 to 6 times higher than the control cells (Fig. 3B). The FLT3-WT/CBLG375 cotransduced cells showed no increase in proliferation rate compared with FLT3-WT cells. The FLT3-WT/CBLR420Q mutant cells showed a 2-fold enhanced proliferation rate compared with FLT3-WT cells (data not shown). Incubation of the FLT3-WT/CBL mutant coexpressing cells with the FLT3 inhibitor PKC412 in increasing nontoxic concentrations up to 50 nmol/L or the FLT3 inhibitor SU5614 up to 5 Amol/L in the presence of 50 ng/mL FLT3 ligand led to a dose-dependent abrogation of the proliferation (Fig. 3C). Coexpression of a kinase-dead FLT3 receptor	 FLT3K644R	 with CBL-70Z provided further evidence that the FLT3 kinase activity is required for the transformed phenotype	 as it did not lead to IL-3 â€“independent proliferation (data not shown). Collectively	 the overexpression of CBL-70Z	 CBLDexon8 or CBLDexon8+9 in FLT3-WT â€“expressing Ba/F3 cells led to factor independent growth and FLT3 ligandâ€“ dependent hyperproliferation. Coexpression of CBL deletion mutants with FLT3-WT autoactivates the FLT3 receptor. The known classes of FLT3 mutations have been shown to autoactivate the kinase activity of FLT3 (16	 27â€“ 30). We prepared lysates of FLT3 ligand â€“ stimulated and nonstimulated Ba/F3 cells coexpressing FLT3- WT and a CBL deletion mutant	 immunoprecipitated the FLT3 receptor	 and analyzed it for tyrosine phosphorylation. In contrast to FLT3-WT- or FLT3-WT/CBL-WT â€“expressing cells	 all three CBL mutantâ€“expressing cells displayed autophosphorylated FLT3 in the absence of FLT3 ligand (Fig. 4A). Stimulation with FLT3 ligand induced high phosphorylation levels of FLT3 Fig. 3.

Downloaded from clincancerres.aacrjournals.org on May 27	 2017. Â© 2009 American Association for Cancer in all analyzed cells. The amount of phosphorylated FLT3 in FLT3-WT/CBL mutantâ€“expressing cells was considerably higher than in control cells	 as was the amount of total FLT3 protein. This confirms the hypothesis that coexpression of a CBL deletion mutant	 but not CBL-WT	 leads to a remarkable stabilization of the FLT3 protein within the cells by inhibiting the down-regulation and degradation of the FLT3 protein. Analysis of the phosphorylation status of transduced CBL in FLT3-WT/CBL mutant â€“expressing cells revealed that all CBL mutants became phosphorylated after stimulation of the cells with FLT3 ligand (Fig. 4B). Of note	 we detected a weak constitutive phosphorylation of CBL mutants	 but not CBL-WT	 in the absence of FL. Autoactivation of FLT3 results in ligand-independent signaling of the receptor (31	 32). We therefore analyzed the activation of three important downstream signaling effectors of FLT3: signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5)	 phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinases B (AKT)	 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Activated STAT5 and AKT were detected in unstimulated FLT3-WT/CBL-70Z-	 Fig. 4.

D	 WST proliferation assays were done in presence of FLT3 ligand and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin.

Â© 2009 American Association for Cancer FLT3-WT/CBLDexon8-	 and FLT3-WT/CBLDexon8+9 â€“ coexpressing cells but not FLT3-WT- or FLT3-WT/CBL-WT â€“ coexpressing cells (Fig. 4C). However	 no differences were observed in MAPK activation	 as all unstimulated cells lack phosphorylated MAPK (data not shown). To evaluate the contribution of the PI3K pathway to the FLT3 ligand â€“ dependent proliferation of FLT3-WT/CBL mutant â€“ expressing cells	 we analyzed the proliferative capacity of FLT3-WT/CBL-70Z â€“ coexpressing cells and FLT3-WT/CBL-WT control cells in the presence of the small molecule inhibitors LY294002 and rapamycin. LY294002 is a well known PI3K inhibitor (33) and rapamycin specifically inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase	 a downstream target of PI3K (34	 35). Both compounds were able to significantly	 but not totally	 inhibit the proliferation of FLT3-WT/CBL-70Z cells (Fig. 4D). The IC50 value for FLT3- WT/CBL-70Z â€“expressing cells were 3.8 Amol/L for LY294002 and 0.5 nmol/L for rapamycin	 pointing to a strong contribution of the PI3K/AKT pathway to the transforming phenotype of FLT3/CBL mutant â€“ coexpressing cells. Incubation of the cells with the maximum used concentration of inhibitor in presence of IL-3 was not cytotoxic (data not shown). Expression of CBL-70Z in FLT3-WT cells does not alter the internalization of the FLT3 receptor. Analysis of EGFR activity has shown that CBL promotes the invagination of the plasma membrane during receptor endocytosis (25	26	 36). CBL-70Z has been proposed to act in a dominant negative manner preventing binding of CBL-WT to activated RTKs (37). We intended to analyze whether the expression of CBL-WT or CBL-70Z might alter the rate or timing of FLT3 internalization after activation with FLT3 ligand. We did staining of FLT3 or FLT3-WT/CBL-70Z â€“expressing cells with CD135 antibody to detect the levels of FLT3 on the surface dependent on the time of FLT3 ligand stimulation up to 60 minutes. In FLT3-WT cells the FLT3 receptor is rapidly internalized after 10 to 20 minutes of FLT3 ligand stimulation (Fig. 5). In contrast to FLT3-WT the kinase-dead FLT3K644R	 which served as a control	 was not internalized even after 60 minutes of FLT3 ligand stimulation. Coexpression of CBL-WT (data not shown) or the mutant CBL- 70Z had no effect on the receptor turnover as after 20 minutes of FLT3 ligand stimulation FLT3 was undetectable on the cell surface in all analyzed cells. Discussion Growth factors and their associated membrane bound receptors play an important role in the initiation and propagation of many types of cancer (38). As the aberrant activation of RTKs by overexpression and activating mutations is a well-investigated topic in oncology research	 it is becoming increasingly clear that impaired receptor down-regulation might contribute to the malignant phenotype as well (39). Receptor down-regulation involves ligand-induced endocytosis and subsequent degradation of the proteins in the lysosomes	 leading to termination of RTK signaling and	 in case of disturbance	 to aberrantly extended signaling. Recent findings have addressed the aberrant down-regulation of FLT3 by CBL in AML (7	10	 11). In this study we provide a comprehensive insight by analyzing 300 AML/MDS and ALL cases. Four of 279 AML/MDS patients	 but no ALL patients	 were found positive for expression of aberrant CBL transcripts in the linker and RING finger domains	 previously characterized as the critical location for transforming mutations. The equivalently analyzed large number of AML and ALL cell lines revealed two positive AML cell lines	 MOLM-13 and the sister cell line MOLM-14	 which matches the results obtained in patient material and points to a low frequency of CBL mutations in AML. However	 an independent study found 1of 12 AML patients with a point mutation in CBL-b (10)	 a CBL family member	 highlighting the importance of further studies to determine the contribution of CBL members to the pathogenesis of AML (10). Of more importance was whether other aberrations in other negative regulatory molecules	 e.g. SHP phosphatases	 lead to deregulated RTK activity. Three of the described aberrant CBL transcripts lack whole exons	 which were significantly decreased in expression or not detectable in the patientâ€™s remission controls. Screening of Fig. 5. The internalization of FLT3-WT is not disturbed by coexpression of CBL70Z. Ba/F3 cells expressingFLT3-WT	 FLT3-WT/CBL-70Z	 or FLT3-KD were stimulated with FLT3 ligand for different time periods from 0 min up to 60 min. After stimulation cells were immediately incubated on ice and cell membranes fixed by addition of 0.3% sodium azide. Cells were stained with FLT3-specific surface antibody and analyzed in fluorescence-activated cell sorter for surface expression levels of FLT3.

Â© 2009 American Association for Cancer normal hematopoietic tissues did not show aberrant CBL transcripts	 further pointing to an oncogenic event in the malignant clone. Indeed	 all three patients carried genomic lesions affecting splice donor or acceptor sites by mutation or deletion	 so that we can clearly exclude aberrant splicing events within the malignant clone. Of note	 we detected a preferential association of CBL mutations with specific subtypes of AML/MDS. Among 43 cases of core binding factor leukemias [t(8;21) and inv(16)] two patients expressing aberrant CBL transcripts were identified [4.7% (0.6%	 15.8%)]. As core binding factor leukemias show a high expression of the RTK KIT (40)	 further studies need to address the question of whether CBL mutations might lead to autoactivation of KIT in these patients. Two of 13 patients with 11q deletions were found positive [15.4% (1.9%	 45.4%)]. This AML/MDS subgroup shows the highest FLT3 expression among all AML subgroups (41)	 so that CBL mutations might be the event causing the high FLT3 expression and an aberrant FLT3 activation in these patients. CBL was shown to be responsible for ubiquitination of several receptors including EGFR	 PDGFRA	 and FMS (25	42	 43). Until now only indirect evidence existed for a role of CBL in human FLT3 downstream signaling. Lavagna-Sevenier et al. reported prominent CBL phosphorylation in human hematopoietic cell lines expressing endogenous FLT3 (44). Recently Sargin et al. reported the physical interaction of CBL with a murine chimeric FLT3 receptor	 where the juxtamembrane domain has been replaced by human sequences (7). Their study presents further indirect evidence that CBL is the responsible E3 ligase ubiquitinating the chimeric murine FLT3 receptor after binding of FLT3 ligand. However	 this remains to be tested for human FLT3. Here	 we provide clear evidence that murine endogenous CBL is rapidly phosphorylated after activation of the human FLT3-WT receptor. As murine and human CBL share 92% homology	 we conclude that this signaling event is conserved from mice to humans. Recently Heiss et al. identified two important in vivo autophosphorylation sites of human FLT3 after FLT3 ligand stimulation	 tyrosines 589 and 599	 which associate with important signaling molecules	 like Src family members and SHP2 (22). Mutation of Y589 and Y599 to phenylalanine revealed a significantly decreased phosphorylation of CBL in response to FLT3 ligand stimulation of the mutant FLT3 receptors	 implicating that these tyrosines serve as docking sites. A similar effect has been seen for the corresponding juxtamembrane tyrosines Y568 and Y570 in KIT and Y572 and Y574 in PDGFRa (21 	 45). However	 as still small amounts of phosphorylated CBL were detectable	 we propose that FLT3 contains more interaction sites for CBL	 which might be direct or indirect via adaptor proteins	 e.g. GRB2. Additional COOHterminal association sites of CBL have been described for FMS (Y973) and for KIT (Y936; refs. 19	 46). In coimmunoprecipitation experiments we have shown interaction of overexpressed human FLT3-WT with human CBL-WT after FLT3 ligand stimulation. The interaction of CBL-70Z with FLT3-WT was even more pronounced	 indicating that the interaction of mutant CBL and FLT3 might be more stable and might be very efficient in blocking CBL-WT from binding sites on activated FLT3 receptors. In vivo colocalization experiments confirmed colocalization of FLT3 and CBL in endosomal vesicles after FLT3 ligand stimulation of cells. It has been suggested that CBL ubiquitylates FLT3 (7). Here	 we show that the presence of overexpressed CBLWT enhances down-regulation of FLT3 after binding of FLT3 ligand	 providing direct evidence for a functional role of CBL in down-regulation of FLT3 activity. To analyze the transforming potential of CBL mutants we have chosen the IL-3 â€“dependent cell line BaF3	 as it is a valuable model for the investigation of activated RTKs. We analyzed all human CBL mutations thus far detected and CBL- 70Z as a control. Only cells coexpressing FLT3-WT and a CBL deletion mutant were able to proliferate in the absence of IL-3. CBL point mutants coexpressed with FLT3WT showed enhanced survival	 but no proliferative capacity in BaF3 cells. This finding is in contrast to the recent study of Sargin et al.	 in which the R420Q point mutation induced IL-3 â€“independent growth in myeloid 32D cells (7). This discrepancy may arise from the different cell systems used and highlights the need to analyze the phenotype of CBL mutations in primary cells. The addition of exogenous FLT3 ligand induced a rapid proliferative response to FLT3-WT CBL deletion mutant â€“ coexpressing cells. As AML blasts coexpress FLT3 ligand leading to an autocrine stimulation	 this phenotype mimics the in vivo situation (47	 48). In the case of CBL point mutants only R420Q	 but not G375 mutants	 show significant growth in vitro in presence of FLT3 ligand. Coexpression of a CBL mutant autophosphorylates FLT3 and downstream molecules STAT5 and AKT. Additionally	 CBL mutants themselves are constitutively phosphorylated	 which points to a so far undescribed mechanism independent from the proposed dominant negative mechanism	 in which CBL mutants block CBL-WT from binding sites at activated RTKs (47). Consistent with a dominant negative behavior of CBL mutants is the fact that we detected higher levels of FLT3 protein in FLT3/CBL mutant cells compared with control cells	 as the increased stability of the FLT3 protein should be the result of a decreased degradation of FLT3. Analyzing the internalization rate of FLT3 in FLT3-WT and FLT3-WT/CBL-70Z cells revealed no difference in rate and speed of internalization; thus	 early steps of endocytosis of FLT3 seem not to be affected by the presence of a CBL deletion mutant. This is in concert with a study from Jiang et al.	 in which late stages of endocytosis	 but not recruitment of EGFR into coated pits	 were affected by CBL-70Z (48). However	 Sargin et al. found a slightly reduced internalization of FLT3 in the presence of CBL-70Z and CBLR420Q	 so that this information is in conflict and needs to be clarified. Taken together	 aberrant CBL transcripts occur in AML and are associated with core binding factor leukemias and 11q aberrations. The CBL deletion mutants show a transforming phenotype in BaF3 cells in the presence of FLT3	 that resembles the phenotype seen in FLT3-activating mutations (FLT3-ITD	 FLT3-TKD	 FLT3-JM-PM). This new mechanism of activation through mutated negative-regulatory molecules of RTKs opens a door for treating patients with PTK inhibitors	 who do not carry mutations in the RTK itself.  Acquired somatic uniparental disomy (UPD) is commonly observed in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)	 myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN)	 or secondary acute myelogenous leukemia (sAML) and may point toward genes harboring mutations. Recurrent UPD11q led to identification of homozygous mutations in c-Cbl	 an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in attenuation of proliferative signals transduced by activated receptor tyrosine kinases. We examined the role and frequency of Cbl gene family mutations in MPN and related conditions.  Methods  We applied high-density SNP-A karyotyping to identify loss of heterozygosity of 11q in 442 patients with MDS	 MDS/MPN	 MPN	 sAML evolved from these conditions	 and primary AML. We sequenced c-Cbl	 Cbl-b	 and Cbl-c in patients with or without corresponding UPD or deletions and correlated mutational status with clinical features and outcomes.  Results  We identified c-Cbl mutations in 5% and 9% of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and sAML	 and also in CML blast crisis and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). Most mutations were homozygous and affected c-Cbl; mutations in Cbl-b were also found in patients with similar clinical features. Patients with Cbl family mutations showed poor prognosis	 with a median survival of 5 months. Pathomorphologic features included monocytosis	 monocytoid blasts	 aberrant expression of phosphoSTAT5	 and c-kit overexpression. Serial studies showed acquisition of c-Cbl mutations during malignant evolution.  Conclusion  Mutations in the Cbl family RING finger domain or linker sequence constitute important pathogenic lesions associated with not only preleukemic CMML	 JMML	 and other MPN	 but also progression to AML	 suggesting that impairment of degradation of activated tyrosine kinases constitutes an important cancer mechanism.  Go to: INTRODUCTION Mutations and genomic aberrations constitute key pathogenic lesions in myeloid malignancies. In primary acute myelogenous leukemia (pAML) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)	 reciprocal translocations have enhanced our understanding of molecular pathogenesis	 improved diagnosis and provided rational therapeutic targets. In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)	 myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN)	 and AML evolved from MDS or MDS/MPN (secondary AML [sAML])	 unbalanced chromosomal lesions predominate and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is of particular importance. LOH can arise either via hemizygous deletion	 where a DNA segment is lost from one homolog while the other remains at one copy per cell	 or by uniparental disomy (UPD)	 wherein the retained homolog is duplicated to preserve two total copies per cell at the locus. Thus	 analysis of recurrent regions of LOH may point toward the presence of important mutations. Mutations seen in MDS and AML affect specific classes of genes and indicate general pathways of leukemia evolution.1 For example	 mutations have been found in a variety of receptor tyrosine kinases	 including c-Kit	 c-Mpl	 and Flt-3.2â€“4 Mutations also affect signal transduction genes such as Jak2 and NPM-1. tP53 constitutes an example of a proapoptotic tumor suppressor gene mutated in aggressive leukemias.5â€“7  Until recently	 metaphase cytogenetics was applied for detection of chromosomal defects including deletions resulting in LOH. Using this technique	 a number of invariant chromosomal abnormalities have been described and minimal affected regions delineated	 pointing towards potentially pathogenic genes. Single nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-A) â€“based cytogenetic analysis allows for better resolution of chromosomal defects	 with identification of previously cryptic unbalanced lesions.8 In particular	 SNP-A is able to identify UPD. We and others have recently shown that somatic UPD affecting various chromosomes can be found frequently in MDS	 MDS/MPN	 and sAML and have identified a number of recurrent areas.9â€“11 Initially	 UPD9p was shown to lead to homozygosity of the Jak2 V617F mutation in MPN.12â€“14 Using SNP-A	 we have demonstrated that other areas of UPD can also be associated with homozygous mutations	 including UPD13p (Flt-3 ITD) and UPD1p (c-Mpl).15	16 Based on this paradigm	 we recently identified a novel recurrent area of UPD at 11q	 frequently present in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and AML evolved from atypical MDS/MPN	 and through delineation of a commonly deleted region have identified mutations in c-Cbl.15 c-Cbl is an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in degradation of activated receptor tyrosine kinases and other tyrosine kinases	 including Src kinases. Consequently	 mutations affecting the RING finger domain (RFD) may have a wide range of effects on proliferation regulation	 crucial to both MPN and AML. In animal studies	 c-Cbl knockout led to hyper-responsiveness to ligand stimulation and expansion of them in cell pools	 overall resulting in a mild proliferative phenotype.17 However	 RFD mutation knock-in in a c-Cblâˆ’/âˆ’ mouse model resulted in a myeloproliferative phenotype and leukemic evolution (W.Y. Langdon	 personal communication	 December 2008). In a transgenic MDS NUP98/HOX13 mouse model	 progression to sAML with acquisition of RAS and c-Cbl mutations occurs frequently.18  We hypothesized that mutations inactivating oncogene degradation pathways may constitute a new class of molecular lesions in myeloid malignancies modifying current paradigms of leukemogenesis. We therefore investigated the presence of mutations in the Cbl family of E3 ubiqutin ligases in selected subtypes of malignant myeloid disorders and determined the phenotypic and functional features as well as clinical outcomes. Based on the study of these features we set out to discern the pathophysiologic principles of molecular dysfunction created by E3 ubiquitin ligase lesions.  Go to: METHODS Patients  Bone marrow aspirates were collected from 442 patients with MDS (n = 115)	 MDS/MPN (n = 98)	 MPN (n = 22)	 sAML (n = 110) evolved from these conditions	 and pAML (n = 97) seen at Cleveland Clinic and Johns Hopkins Hospital between 2003 and 2008 (Appendix Table A1	 online only). Informed consent for sample collection was obtained according to protocols approved by institutional review boards. Diagnosis was confirmed at each primary institution and assigned according to WHO classification criteria.19  Single Nuclotide Polymorphism Array Analysis  High-density Affymetrix SNP-A (250K and 6.0 arrays; Affymetrix	 Santa Clara	 CA) were applied as a karyotyping platform to identify LOH on chromosome 11q. Lesions identified by SNP-A were compared to the Database of Genomic Variants20 (http://projects.tcag.ca/variation/) and an internal control series (n = 1	003) to exclude known copy number variations. To confirm all regions of LOH detected by 250K SNP-A	 we repeated samples when possible on 6.0 arrays and analyzed using Genotyping Console version 2.0 (Affymetrix). Signal intensity was analyzed and SNP calls determined using Gene Chip Genotyping Analysis Software version 4.0 (GTYPE	 Affymetrix). Copy number and areas of UPD were investigated using a Hidden Markov Model and CN Analyzer for Affymetrix GeneChip Mapping 250K arrays (CNAG version 3.0) as previously described.21  E3 Ubiquitin Ligase Mutational Screening  To screen patients for mutations in c-Cbl	 Cbl-b	 Cbl-c	 and Hakai	 direct genomic sequencing of all exons was performed (details of primers and conditions are available on request). For sequencing	 250 ng of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product	 3 Î¼mol/L original forward or reverse primer	 2 Î¼L Big Dye version 3.1 (Applied Biosystems	 Foster City	 CA)	 and 14.5 Î¼L deionized H2O were amplified under the following conditions: 95Â°C (2 minutes) followed by 25 cycles of 95Â°C (10 seconds)	 50Â°C (5 seconds)	 and 60Â°C (4 minutes). Sequencing was performed as previously described.15 If a mutation was intronic	 RNA was extracted by TRIzol (Invitrogen	 Carlsbad	 CA) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction performed for confirmation of splice variants.  Immunohistochemical Detection of pSTAT5  Staining was performed on a Benchmark XT platform (Ventana Medical Systems	 Tucson	 AZ)	 according to the manufacturer's instructions	 using mouse monoclonal antiphospho-STAT5a/b (Y694/99; Advantex BioReagents LLP	 Conroe	 TX) at 1:500 dilution. All stains were scored without knowledge of the clinical diagnosis or mutational status. Phospho-STAT5-positive staining (nMEG pSTAT5) was defined as previously reported.22	23 Images were obtained via digital microscopy using an Olympus BX51 microscope (Olympus America	 Melville	 NY) equipped with either a UPlanFl 40Ã—/0.75 numeric aperture (NA) or a UPlanFl 100 Ã—/1.30 NA objective. Images were captured using a Dage-MTI Model DC330E charge-coupled device camera (Dage-MTI	 Michigan City	 IN) attached to the microscope with a U-TV1X-2 video adapter (Olympus America) and a 0.45Ã— camera coupler (Diagnostic Instruments	 Sterling Heights	 MI).  Statistical Analysis  Overall survival was defined as the time a patient was diagnosed with a myeloid malignancy at Cleveland Clinic or Johns Hopkins to death or last known contact	 and analyzed using Kaplan-Meier statistics and Cox's proportional hazards model. For comparison of the frequency of clinical features between Cbl family mutation and wild-type (WT)	 categoric variables were analyzed using Fisher's exact test.  Go to: RESULTS Detection of UPD11q Using SNP-A and Detection of c-Cbl Mutation  Previously	 we identified homozygous c-Cbl mutations in patients with CMML and UPD11q.15 Using SNP-A karyotyping	 we studied a large cohort of patients (n = 442) with MDS and related disorders	 including JMML and CML blast crisis (CML-BC)	 to assess the frequency of this lesion within clinical subtypes. Three hundred one and 187 cases were examined by 250K and 6.0 arrays	 respectively. Forty-six cases were analyzed using both arrays	 yielding identical results. Based on the analysis of 1	003 controls	 we determined the average size and location of nonclonal regions of autozygosity. All of these nonclonal regions were interstitial. For the purpose of this study	 we have excluded all regions of autozygosity based on the size criteria (27 Mb) derived from controls. The remaining regions were confirmed by analysis of germ-line samples (nonclonal CD3+ lymphocytes) in 45 patients (Fig 1A). Regions of homozygosity found in both bone marrow and CD3+ fractions were excluded from further analyses. We confirmed UPD11q detected on 250K arrays by repeated analyses using ultra-high density Affymetrix 6.0 arrays and Genotyping Console version 2.0 software (Fig 1B). Among a total of 133 regions of somatic UPD on multiple chromosomes including 1	4	17	 and 21	 UPD11q was most common (n = 17). LOH can also result from deletions	 and deletions involving 11q23.3 were found in 29 patients (Fig 1C). Sequencing c-Cbl revealed mutations in 13 cases (76%) of UPD11q. However	 among patients with deletion11q	 a c-Cbl mutation was found in only one case (CMML). We also analyzed patients without LOH11q to assess the frequency of heterozygous mutations and identified five cases (1.2%).  Fig 1 Fig 1 Detecting acquired	 segmental uniparental disomy (UPD) using single nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-A) technology. (A) SNP-A karyograms of both whole bone marrow (BM) cells and CD3+ lymphocytes of a patient show the somatic nature of acquired UPD in ... c-Cbl Mutations and Clinical Features  We sequenced all exons of c-Cbl; all mutations	 except for 1 frame shift mutation in the tyrosine kinaseâ€“binding domain	 were associated with the RFD or linker sequence	 which are highly conserved among species. More importantly	 12 mutations in the RFD were located at or next to a cysteine residue (63%; Fig 2). The presence of each somatic mutation was confirmed by bidirectional DNA sequencing of multiple isolates and comparison against CD3+ sorted lymphocytes when possible.  Fig 2. Fig 2. Identification of variations in c-Cbl	 Cbl-b and Cbl-c RING finger (RF) domain. Schematic representation shows the major domains of c-Cbl	 Cbl-b	 and Cbl-c	 primarily the tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain	 linker sequence (L)	 RF domain	 proline-rich ... In one case of a patient with MDS (refractory anemia subtype) and monosomy 7 who transformed to AML	 SNP-A karyotyping revealed the UPD11q	 yet after transformation to AML sequencing identified a c-Cbl mutation creating a novel splice site resulting in a longer transcript (Appendix Fig A1	 online only). We also found a hemizygous mutation in the linker sequence in a CMML patient with a microdeletion of 11q23.3 previously undetected by metaphase cytogenetics (Appendix Fig A2	 online only). Eleven mutations were found in CMML and similar forms of MDS/MPN unclassifiable either at or before the time of testing; 6 of these patients progressed to sAML (55%). In total	 two (5%) of 38 patients with CMML	 10 (9%) of 110 with sAML	 and one (1%) of 115 patients with MDS carried mutant c-Cbl (Appendix Table A2	 online only). In addition	 c-Cbl mutations were found in four (19%) of 21 patients with JMML and one (10%) of 10 with CML-BC.  Other Mutations and Nonsynonimous SNPs in Related E3 Ubiquitin Ligases  The Cbl family contains several other E3 ligases	 including Cbl-b (3q) and Cbl-c (19q) as well as a novel member with high homology called Hakai (7q). Based on structural and functional similarities we hypothesized that these genes can also harbor mutations associated with similar clinical phenotypes. When we sequenced 12 patients with corresponding UPDs	 no mutations were found. However	 when we sequenced all patients in our cohort without c-Cbl mutations	 we identified three with a heterozygous and one with a hemizygous Cbl-b mutation (Appendix Fig A3	 online only) and three patients (one cell line) with a Cbl-c frame shift polymorphism with a single base insertion	 all affecting the RFD (Fig 2). In addition	 we identified 12 (7%) of 167 patients with myeloid malignancies harboring another rare nonsynonymous SNP in Cbl-c	 also affecting the RFD (H405Y). The frequency of this SNP in the general population is less than 1% (data not shown).  Clinical Characteristics in Patients With Cbl Family Mutation  In order to identify the pathologic subtypes in which Cbl family member mutations may play a role	 we systematically investigated a wide range of myeloid malignancies. They were most commonly associated with MDS/MPN subentities	 including CMML and atypical MDS/MPN	 and some cases of typical MDS. In addition	 Cbl family mutations appear to be present in sAML with an antecedent history of MDS/MPN. Based on this distribution of c-Cbl mutations	 we analyzed other related disease entities within MDS/MPN and MPN; we also identified c-Cbl mutations in JMML and in CML-BC (Appendix Table A2). This pattern suggests that c-Cbl mutations can be a characteristic feature of atypical MDS/MPN syndromes or serve as a second genetic hit facilitating malignant evolution. Our study demonstrates the ubiquitous nature of Cbl family mutations	 in particular in the context of very circumscribed phenotypes of myelomonocytic neoplasms.  Several common clinical features were identified among 27 patients affected by the Cbl family of variants	 including monoblast or monocyte proliferation (74%)	 splenomegaly (81%)	 and surface expression of c-kit on malignant cells (93%). Characteristic nuclear features included abnormal lobulation and hyperchromatic and raisinoid nuclei of megakaryocytes seen in patients with CMML (Appendix Fig A4	 online only). By immunohistochemistry	 c-Cbl mutant megakaryocyte nuclei displayed aberrant pSTAT5 staining (86%; Appendix Fig A4)	 while pSTAT5 was not expressed in patients without c-Cbl mutations. In three cases	 pSTAT5 expression was not detected in specimens obtained before the mutation was present (Appendix Fig A4). The clinical phenotype of patients with Cbl-b mutations was not distinguishable from that of patients with c-Cbl mutations. The allelic pattern of Cbl family mutations plays an important role in disease phenotype in patients; in sAML eight (62%) of 13 c-Cbl family mutations were homozygous (Fig 3A).  Fig 3. Fig 3. Cbl family mutations in myeloid malignancies and unique clinical characteristics of patients with mutations. (A) Cbl family mutations are frequently observed in secondary acute myelogenous leukemia (sAML; 12%)	 myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms ... To evaluate the impact of Cbl family mutations	 we first compared mutant and WT cases on the basis of various clinical parameters (Table 1). In mutant cases	 monocyte counts were significantly higher as compared with patients with WT Cbl family genes. A higher proportion of patients with c-Cbl mutations were treated with intense chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation	 suggesting that these therapies were more frequently selected because of the aggressive biology of the Cbl mutation-associated disease. When we performed univariate analysis of survival impact of various clinical variables	 significant differences in WBC	 monocyte counts	 disease risk	 and the presence of Cbl family gene mutations (Table 2) were found. Chemotherapy was an adverse risk factor for survival	 likely as it correlated with more advanced disease in multivariate analyses. The prognosis of patients with Cbl family mutations was poor	 especially in those with homozygous mutations. The median overall survival was 5 months for all patients	 with a significant difference of 1.7 months versus 20 months for patients with homozygous and heterozygous mutations	 respectively (P = .04; Fig 3B). In multivariate analyses advanced disease (hazard ratio [HR]	 5.64; 95% CI	 3.8 to 8.36) and Cbl family mutations (HR	 2.17; 95% CI	 1.18 to 4.02; Table 3) were shown to be independent adverse factors for overall survival.  Table 1. Table 1. Comparison of Clinical Characteristics Between Wild-Type and Mutant Cbl Family Genes Table 2. Table 2. Univariate Analysis of Overall Survival in Clinical Variables Table 3. Table 3. Multivariate Analysis of Overall Survival in Clinical Variables Go to: DISCUSSION In leukemia	 cytogenetic abnormalities identify underlying pathophysiology and carry enormous prognostic and therapeutic significance. Various examples of gain of function and inactivating mutations show that homologous recombination may lead to duplication of affected alleles.24 Consequently	 areas of somatic UPD may point toward genes carrying putative pathogenic mutations. When high density SNP-A was applied as a karyotyping platform in a large number of patients with MDS and related disorders	 we noted recurrent somatic UPD at chromosome 11q	 particularly frequent in MDS/MPN. Commonly deleted region mapping and analysis of genes located within this region led us to hypothesize that c-Cbl may contain mutations. Sequencing of c-Cbl in patients affected by somatic UPD11q revealed RFD and linker sequence mutations present in patients with CMML	 MDS/ MPN unclassifiable	 and sAML derived from these conditions or MDS. We also found new mutations in Cbl-b with a clinical phenotype similar to that seen with c-Cbl RFD mutations. Consequently	 our results imply that E3 ubiquitin ligases constitute a novel class of genes in whom mutations reflect a novel general mechanism of leukemogenesis. This notion is supported by the variety of pathomorphologic subentities of myeloid malignancies affected by mutations of the Cbl family. Moreover	 a novel frame shift polymorphism was found in Cbl-c in patients with MDS/MPN. However	 the relevance of this otherwise extremely rare polymorphism is not clear as the corresponding gene does not show significant expression in myeloid cells.  Cas-Br-M	 a retrovirus	 contains v-Cbl which corresponds to about one third of the murine c-Cbl gene and contains only the murine phosphotyrosine binding domain.25 This virus consistently induces a type of pre-B cell lymphoma in infected mice. The importance of c-Cbl in hematopoiesis has been previously demonstrated in knockout mice that show hyper-responsiveness to hematopoietic growth factors	 expansion of the progenitor and stem cell pool	 and mild myeloproliferative features.17 However	 recent results obtained with an RFD knock-in in a c-Cblâˆ’/âˆ’ mouse model parallels the phenotype observed in patients; the mutant mouse demonstrated a severe myeloproliferative phenotype (W.Y. Langdon	 personal communication). Indeed	 in patients mutations were predominantly located in the RFD and affected structurally essential cysteines	 possibly led to inactivation of RFD function by frame shift	 or created novel splicing sites resulting in larger transcripts. In addition	 c-Cbl mutations were homozygous or hemizygous	 implying that the presence of a WT allele is protective. It is likely that mutations do not lead to the simple knockout of c-Cbl function. Rather	 by affecting the RFD	 they render it a proto-oncogene	 consistent with the oncogenic properties of v-Cbl. Previously	 mutations of c-Cbl have been described in a limited number of patients with AML	 but neither their function nor their clinical phenotype could be delineated without a comprehensive study of corresponding karyotypes and clinical outcomes.26â€“28  c-Cbl is a member of the Cbl family of E3 ubiquitin ligases	 which poly- or monoubiquitinate a number of important tyrosine kinases serving as important transduction elements of proliferative signals and activated tyrosine kinase receptors	 including Flt-3	 c-kit	 and M-CSF.29	30 Consequently	 inactivation of ubiquitination may lead to enhanced and prolonged signaling	 a function which can explain the phenotype in patients (Fig 4). Based on this essential role of E3 ligases	 we hypothesized that another Cbl family member	 Cbl-b	 may also be affected by mutations in myeloid malignancies. Sequencing of these genes in patients who did not harbor c-Cbl mutations revealed that these genes can also be affected by mutations leading to the inactivation of the RFD. These patients displayed a clinical phenotype analogous to those with c-Cbl mutations. The clinical features corresponding to c-Cbl mutations included monocytic features	 aberrant and increased phosphorylation of pSTAT5	 and monocytoid blasts. An increased frequency of mutations in patients with frank AML may argue either that c-Cbl mutations lead to an invariant progression to an aggressive phenotype	 or that they constitute a second hit event frequently occurring in the context of atypical myeloproliferative disorders. In fact	 unlike other reports that looked at patients with inv16	 we found no mutation of Cbl family genes in de novo AML	 including French-American-British type M4 or M5.28 Both theories are supported by the dismal prognosis of patients with Cbl family mutations. The close association of c-Cbl mutations with monocyte expansion	 such as that seen in JMML	 CMML	 or sAML with monocytoid features	 suggests a primary role of c-Cbl mutations in the pathogenesis of these diseases	 while occurrence of c-Cbl mutations during evolution to AML in serially studied patients and the high proportion of cases with advanced leukemia affected by c-Cbl mutations argues for its auxiliary facilitator role.  Fig 4. Fig 4. Potential intracellular consequences of c-Cbl mutations. c-Cbl is a member of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl family	 which poly- or monoubiquitinate a number of important receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK)	 including Flt-3	 c-kit	 and CSF-1	 for degradation. ... Taken together	 our data suggests that Cbl family mutations constitute a novel class of pathogenic molecular lesions associated with a spectrum of myeloid malignancies characterized by myeloproliferative features and poor prognosis. Inactivation of the RFD	 and thereby ubiquitination involved in downmodulation of proliferative signaling	 constitutes a general mechanism of leukemogenesis likely present in a variety of malignancies.

Cbl-c gene is not known to be expressed in myeloid malignancies. â€ Cell line from a patient with secondary AML (sAML).  Despite the discovery of the p.V617F in JAK2	 the molecular pathogenesis of some chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms remains unclear. Although very rare	 different studies have identified CBL (Cas-Br-Murine ecotropic retroviral transforming sequence) mutations in V617FJAK2-negative patients	 mainly located in the RING finger domain. In order to determine the frequency of CBL mutations in these diseases	 we studied different regions of all CBL family genes (CBL	 CBLB and CBLC) in a selected group of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms. We also included V617FJAK2-positive patients to check whether mutations in CBL and JAK2 are mutually exclusive events.  Design and Methods  Using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography	 we screened for mutations in CBL	 CBLB and CBLC in a group of 172 V617FJAK2-negative and 232 V617FJAK2-positive patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms not selected for loss of heterozygosity. The effect on cell proliferation of the mutations detected was analyzed on a 32D(FLT3) cell model.  Results  An initial screening of all coding exons of CBL	 CBLB and CBLC in 44 V617FJAK2-negative samples revealed two new CBL mutations (p.C416W in the RING finger domain and p.A678V in the proline-rich domain). Analyses performed on 128 additional V617FJAK2-negative and 232 V617FJAK2-positive samples detected three CBL changes (p.T402HfsX29	 p.P417R and p.S675C in two cases) in four V617FJAK2-positive patients. None of these mutations was found in 200 control samples. Cell proliferation assays showed that all of the mutations promoted hypersensitivity to interleukin-3 in 32D(FLT3) cells.  Conclusions  Although mutations described to date have been found in the RING finger domain and in the linker region of CBL	 we found a similar frequency of mutations in the proline-rich domain. In addition	 we found CBL mutations in both V617FJAK2-positive (4/232; 1.7%) and negative (2/172; 1.2%) patients and all of them promoted hypersensitivity to interleukin-3.  Keywords: CBL	 MPN	 mutation analysis Go to: Introduction BCR-ABL1-negative chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are a heterogeneous group of clonal hematologic malignancies characterized by abnormal proliferation and survival of one or more myeloid lineage cells. In some cases these diseases evolve to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These hematologic neoplasms include both classic MPN [essential thrombocythemia (ET)	 polycythemia vera (PV) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF)] and atypical MPN (such as chronic eosinophilic leukemia	 chronic neutrophilic leukemia	 hypereosinophilic syndrome	 mast cell disease and myeloid neoplasms with eosinophilia	 among others).1  In the late 1990s some genetic aberrations were described as molecular disease-causing events in these neoplasms	 most of them via fusion genes resulting from reciprocal chromosomal translocations. Such fusions activate tyrosine kinases	 playing a role similar to ABL1 in chronic myeloid leukemia.2	3 However these fusions are very rare and most of them have been reported in one or two cases worldwide.4  This situation changed in 2005 with the description of the p.V617F mutation (valine to phenylalanine in amino acid 617) in JAK2	 found not only in classic MPN but also in a small number of atypical MPN and other myeloid neoplasms.5 Furthermore	 it was found that most of the V617FJAK2-negative cases of PV had other transforming mutations in exon 12 of JAK2. Other gain-of-function mutations have also been described in genes coding for JAK-STAT receptors	 such as MPL or EPOR in familial and sporadic cases of MPN.6â€“10 However	 to date it is not known whether these mutations cause the full phenotype or whether they cooperate with other still uncharacterized mutations. Thus	 there is still a significant proportion of patients in whom the molecular disease-causing event remains to be discovered.  Recently	 the application of single nucleotide polymorphism and comparative genomic hybridization array technologies has led to the identification of new mutations in loss of heterozygosity regions affecting genes such as TET2	11 ASXL1	12 IKZF1	13 RUNX1	14 IDH1 and IDH2	15 EZH2	16 NF1	17 and CBL.18â€“23  CBL (11q23) codes for a protein of the Cbl family of E3-ubiquitin ligases (CBL	 CBLB and CBLC) that acts as a negative regulator of some cell signaling pathways	 by promoting the ubiquitination of several signaling molecules including some tyrosine kinases. CBL proteins share a common structure	 with a highly conserved tyrosine kinase-binding domain in the amino-terminal region that determines substrate specificity. The catalytic E3-ubiquitin ligase activity resides in the RING finger domain	 which is separated from the tyroskine kinase binding domain by a linker region. CBL and CBLB have two other domains that are not well conserved in CBLC: a proline-rich region involved in the recognition of SH3-proteins	 and the carboxy-terminal UBA domain that interacts with ubiquitin molecules allowing dimer formation.24 CBL and CBLB play an important role in cell signaling in the majority of tissues	 while CBLC activity seems to be restricted to epithelial cells.25â€“27  Over the last few years several groups have identified CBL mutations in different hematologic neoplasms	 although most commonly in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)/MPN such as chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.18â€“23	28â€“39 These changes cause the loss of E3-ubiquitin ligase activity	 resulting in deregulation of downstream targets and an increase in cell proliferation rates. To our knowledge	 CBL mutations seem to be mutually exclusive with other mutations frequently found in these diseases such as Ras mutations	 FLT3-ITD or V617FJAK2. In this study we searched for mutations in CBL	 CBLB and CBLC in a group of 172 V617FJAK2-negative and 232 V617FJAK2-positive MPN patients not selected for loss of heterozygosity	 using a denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC) method. Although most of the mutations described previously have been found in the RING finger domain and in the linker region of CBL	 we found novel mutations also in the proline-rich domain	 both in V617FJAK2-positive and -negative patients.  Go to: Design and Methods Samples  Blood samples were collected from 404 different Caucasian MPN patients without the BCR-ABL1 fusion from several hospitals from the north of Spain. Informed consent was obtained from individual patients and the study was approved by the internal Ethics Committee. The first series of patients included 44 with V617FJAK2-negative MPN (4 diagnosed as PV	 15 as ET	 4 as PMF and 21 as atypical MPN). Later	 a second series of 128 V617FJAK2-negative MPN patients (16 PV	 81 ET and 31 PMF) and 232 V617FJAK2-positive MPN patients (69 PV	 149 ET and 14 PMF) were included. The presence/absence of V617FJAK2 mutation was determined in all patients by amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR).40 In addition	 all 404 samples were negative for the presence of MPL p.W515 mutations by dHPLC. Human leukemia cell lines HEL	 M07e	 UKE-1 and SET-2 were also included in the study (Table 1).  Table 1. Table 1. Frequency of CBL mutations found in our series. Initial mutational screening by dHPLC included 20 healthy (no disease) samples used as controls in order to check the frequency of sequence changes observed in our population. For those fragments in which we found sequence variants in patients	 we also included 180 additional control samples in order to rule out that the changes detected were population polymorphisms.  Cell lines  Cell proliferation assays were performed on 32Dcl3 (32D) murine myeloid cells (DSMZ N. ACC411) incubated at 37ÂºC in 5% CO2 and maintained in 90% RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 10 ng/mL murine interleukin-3 (Recombinant Mouse IL3	 Cat #PMC0035	 GibcoÂ®	 Invitrogen Ltd.	 Paisley	 UK).  Plasmids  Plasmids with tagged human open reading frames in pCMV6-AC-GFP vectors were purchased from Origene Technologies (Cat #RG214069 for CBL	 RG206047 for CBLB and RG205130 for CBLC). The tagged human cDNA clone for FLT3 was also purchased from Origene Technologies as pCMV6-Entry vector (Cat #RC211459) and subcloned into pCMV6-AC-RFP vector (Cat #PS100034). These pCMV6-AC vectors carried the NeoR gene. The pCMVâ€“HA ubiquitin vector was a gift from Dr. Francis Grand from Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory (Salisbury	 UK).  Denaturing high performance liquid chromatography analysis  Genomic DNA was obtained from all the samples and amplified with GenomiPhi v2.0 (GE Healthcare	 Piscataway	 NJ	 USA) in order to obtain enough material for mutational screening. All mutations were confirmed using the original unamplified sample and no discrepancies were observed with whole-genome amplified DNA.  We designed primers with Primer341 to amplify all coding exons of the three screened genes (CBL	 CBLB and CBLC) in flanking introns. For each fragment we also designed a mutant primer introducing a nucleotide change in the forward or reverse primer	 depending on the corresponding melting profile	 to create a control mutated fragment to validate each dHPLC assay. Melting profiles for PCR fragments	 solvent gradients and temperature conditions were calculated by Navigatorâ„¢ Software v1.6.2 (Transgenomic Ltd.	 Omaha	 NE	 USA) and validated experimentally. All the analyses were performed on a WAVEÂ® 4500HT System (Transgenomic Ltd.	 Omaha	 NE	 USA) with a DNASepÂ® HT cartridge. Online Supplementary Table S1 contains a list of primers	 the sizes of the amplified fragments and dHPLC conditions.  PCR reactions were performed with AmpliTaqâ„¢ Gold (Applied Biosystems	 Foster City	 CA	 USA) using standard protocols. After cycling	 samples were subjected to several cycles of heating and cooling in order to create heteroduplex molecules to improve mutation detection by dHPLC. For each fragment	 we sequenced two samples of each different elution profile. Results were analyzed with Mutation Surveyor v3.10 (SoftGenetics LLC	 State College	 PA	 USA) and compared to genomic reference sequences (ENSG00000110395 for CBL	 ENSG00000114423 for CBLB and ENSG00000142273 for CBLC).  All coding exons of CBL	 CBLB and CBLC were initially analyzed in a group of 44 V617FJAK2-negative patients (4 PV	 4 PMF	 15 ET and 21 atypical MPN). In light of the results we analyzed the RING finger domain coding exons (exons 8 and 9 from CBL	 exons 9 and 10 from CBLB and exons 7 and 8 from CBLC) in 128 V617FJAK2-negative (16 PV	 31 PMF	 81 ET) and in 232 V617FJAK2-positive MPN (69 PV	 14 PMF	 149 ET)	 as well as in human leukemia cell lines M07e	 HEL	 SET-2 and UKE-1. We also included CBL exon 12 in this extended analysis because we observed a p.A678V change in one sample from the initial series.  CBL exon 8 deletions  Some of the mutations described for CBL are large deletions involving exon 8 (RING finger domain)18	21â€“23	29	30	32	37	42 and the design of our mutation screening assay was not able to detect some of them. We	 therefore	 designed a new PCR assay with primers located in exon 7 and intron 9 (E7Fw: 5â€™-TCCTGATGGAC-GAAATCAGA-3â€™; E9-Rv: 5â€™-CTCACAATGGATTTTGCCAGT-3â€™) which would amplify a normal fragment of 989 bp. With this assay	 any large deletion of exon 8 would be detected as a product of smaller size.  Site-directed mutagenesis  All missense mutations detected for each gene were functionally tested. Mutants p.R420Q (used as the control mutant)	 p.C416W	 p.P417R	 p.T402HfsX29	 p.S675C and p.A678V for CBL; p.R462W for CBLB and p.Q419PfsX81	 p.P435S and p.E392K for CBLC were obtained using the QuikChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies	 La Jolla	 CA	 USA) from the original plasmids.  Transfection  Transfections were performed with Amaxa NucleofectorÂ® Device II technology (Lonza Cologne GmbH	 Basel	 Switzerland) according to standard protocols. Cells of the 32D cell line in exponential growth were first transfected with FLT3 vector and maintained in medium until a second CBL/Ubi transfection. From the first transfection with FLT3 vector	 cells were grown with Geneticin (G-418 sulfate	 Cat #11811 GibcoÂ®	 Invitrogen Ltd.	 Paisley	 UK) to select those clones that had incorporated the vector.  Cell proliferation assays  Proliferation analysis was performed with the CellTiter 96Â® AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS	 Ref #G3580	 Promega Corp	 Madison	 WI	 USA) according to standard protocols	 comparing cells transfected with wild-type CBL (CBL	 CBLB or CBLC in each case) with cells transfected with mutant CBL during 3 or 4 days	 in triplicate. In each case we carried out four different experiments	 also including 32D(FLT3) cells transfected with pCMV6-AC-GFP and mock-transfected 32D(FLT3) cells as controls. In all cases cells were supplemented with 10 ng/mL recombinant human FLT3-ligand (Cat #GF038	 Millipore	 Temecula	 CA	 USA) and with 10 ng/mL murine interleukin-3 (Recombinant Mouse IL3	 Cat #PMC0035	 GibcoÂ®	 Invitrogen Ltd.	 Paisley	 UK). As the positive mutant control we used p.R420Q	 a previously described CBL mutant with an effect on cell proliferation.28  Statistical analysis  Results from MTS proliferation assays were compared using the Studentâ€™s t-test implemented in UNStat (a free tool available at http://www.unav.es/departamento/genetica/unstat).  Go to: Results Mutational screening  In the initial screening of all coding exons of CBL	 CBLB and CBLC in 44 patients with V617FJAK2-negative MPN we detected two missense changes not previously described in CBL (2/44; 4.5%). In this first series we also found three missense changes in CBLC described as single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs35457630	 rs3208856	 rs116023028) in the RING finger domain and proline-rich region. These changes were detected in samples from both patients and controls. No missense changes were detected in CBLB.  CBL changes (p.C416W or g.72251T>G and p.A678V or g.81664C>T) were found in patients diagnosed with atypical MPN	 although the disease in the patient with p.A678V later evolved to CMML because of the development of dysplastic features. Whereas p.C416W affected the RING finger domain	 like other mutations previously reported	 p.A678V was located in exon 12	 which codes for the proline-rich domain of CBL (see Figure 1). For this reason	 we decided to include this exon in the analysis of CBL in an additional group of patients.  Figure 1. Figure 1. (A) CBL mutations described to date in myeloid malignancies. Mutations found in our analysis are colored in red. In contrast to other studies in which mutations were found in the linker region (LR) and the RING finger domain	 we also found two novel changes ... When we analyzed exon 12 of CBL and the RING finger domains of CBL	 CBLB and CBLC in the additional series of samples (128 V617FJAK2-negative and 232 V617FJAK2-positive patients)	 we found three CBL changes in four V617FJAK2-positive patients (4/232	 1.7%). The first one (detected in a patient with ET) was a not previously reported g.71955_71955A deletion in exon 8. This is a frameshift change that truncates the RING finger domain with loss of the proline-rich and UBA carboxy-terminal domains (p.T402HfsX29) (Figure 1). The second change was a substitution g.72253C>G (p.P417R) in exon 9 in a patient diagnosed with PMF	 also affecting the RING finger domain and previously identified in a patient with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.37 Finally	 the third CBL mutation was a not previously reported g.81655C>G substitution (p.S675C) in exon 12 (proline-rich region). Remarkably	 this change was detected in two different V617FJAK2-positive patients	 one with ET and the other with PV. None of the 200 control samples analyzed showed any of these changes. CBL exon 8 deletions were not observed in any case.  We also detected a not previously reported substitution (g.149486C>T	 p.R462W) in the RING finger domain of CBLB in a sample from a V617FJAK2-positive patient with PV (1/232; 0.4%). In CBLC	 we detected one frameshift change (g.15702_15703insC	 p.Q419PfsX81)	 in a patient with V617FJAK2-negative PV	 which has been described as a polymorphism (rs66944506).  None of the cell lines included in these analyses (HEL	 SET-2	 UKE-1 and M07e) showed any CBL	 CBLB or CBLC mutation.  CBL mutations promote hypersensitivity to interleukin-3 in 32D(FLT3) cells  A significantly higher number of cells was observed in 32D(FLT3) cells transfected with CBL mutants than with wild-type CBL (P<0.05	 Figure 2)	 grouping data from four independent cell proliferation assays. In addition	 cells transfected with mutant vectors showed significantly higher proliferation rates in all cases (P<0.05	 Figure 2) and with stronger effects than those observed for the p.R420Q control mutation.  Figure 2. Figure 2. (A to F) All missense mutations detected in CBL were functionally tested. Left	 results of cell proliferation assays corresponding to four different transfections for each mutation. Two transfection controls (cells mock-transfected and cells transfected ... By contrast	 assays for p.R462W in CBLB and for p.Q419PfsX81	 p.E392K and p.P435S in CBLC (Online Supplementary Figure S1) showed no significant differences (P>0.05) in proliferation rates.  Go to: Discussion In the last few years the detection of regions with acquired loss of heterozygosity in some patients	 mainly caused by acquired uniparental disomy	 has allowed the identification of candidate genes that may be mutated in myeloid neoplasms. One of these genes is CBL	 which codes for an E3-ubiquitin ligase protein. Cbl family proteins (CBL	 CBLB and CBLC) play an important role as regulators of several signaling pathways promoting the ubiquitination and degradation of some RTK and CTK	44 many of which are involved in these diseases.4	45	46  The first CBL mutation identified was p.R420Q	 affecting the RING finger domain in a patient with AML.28 Subsequently	 other mutations have been reported with variable frequencies in myeloid neoplasms	 affecting not only the RING finger domain but also the linker region (Figure 1). These events have been observed in 1â€“33% cases of secondary AML	 1â€“7% of MPN and 2â€“33% of MDS/MPN and AML	18â€“23	28â€“39 but their frequencies could be as high as 85â€“90% in patients with loss of heterozygosity in 11q.18â€“20	22	23	33 Some reports have also described that 7% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer have CBL mutations	 so this gene can be mutated in other types of tumor.47 CBLB mutations and CBLC missense polymorphisms affecting the RING finger domain have also been described in myeloid neoplasms but at a lower frequency and with unknown effects.22	23	29  In this study we searched for mutations in CBL	 CBLB and CBLC in a cohort of 404 V617FJAK2-negative and -positive MPN patients not selected for the presence of loss of heterozygosity in 11q. Our results show that CBL is mutated in V617FJAK2-negative MPN at a frequency similar to that previously reported (p.C416W and p.A678V; 1.2%	 2/172	 Table 1).49 Both patients with mutations were initially diagnosed as having atypical MPN (2/21; 9.5%)	 although in one of them the disease evolved to CMML due to the development of dysplastic features. CMML is the disease with the highest frequency of CBL mutations reported to date.18â€“20	22	34 None of these mutations had been previously described and	 notably	 p.A678V was located in the proline-rich domain. In V617JAK2-positive MPN we found two mutations affecting the RING finger domain (p.T402HfsX29 in a patient with ET and p.P417R in a patient with PMF) and a recurrent change in the proline-rich domain (p.S675C in a patient with ET and in another one with PV) of CBL. Although TET2	 ASXL1 and JAK2 mutations have been found concurrently	50 CBL mutations and V617FJAK2 seemed to be mutually exclusive events.13	21	26	51 However	 we have found a similar frequency of CBL mutations in both V617FJAK2-positive and V617FJAK2-negative patients (Table 1)	 suggesting that the prevalence of CBL mutations could increase if V617FJAK2-positive patients were also included in CBL mutational studies. Unfortunately	 we cannot know whether both mutations are in the same or in different clones or whether they are monoallelic or biallelic because of the type of sample available. None of the V617FJAK2-positive cell lines analyzed (HEL	 SET-2 and UKE-1) showed CBL mutations that might help us to elucidate how both events could cooperate to drive the disease.43  In order to determine the effect of all these mutations on cell proliferation	 in vitro functional assays were performed. All CBL mutations induced a hyperproliferative response to interleukin-3 in the 32D(FLT3) model	 similar to that induced by the well-characterized p.R420Q mutation.28	31 This effect was not observed for the mutations detected in CBLB and CBLC. CBL was initially described as a putative tumor suppressor gene because of its negative regulatory function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Most of the mutations reported are located in conserved residues of the linker region and RING finger domain and could impair this regulatory function.44	46	52 RING finger domain mutations p.T402HfsX29	 p.C416W and p.P417R described in this work also affect conserved residues of the protein (Figure 3) with a similar effect on the loss of activity of CBL.  Figure 3. Figure 3. Evolutionary conservation of the CBL regions in which mutations have been detected. Sequence comparison between humans (Homo sapiens) and other mammals (Mus musculus	 Rattus norvegicus	 Pan troglodytes	 Bos taurus	 Macaca mulatta and Equus caballus) in ... Notably	 we found two additional	 novel mutations (one of them recurrent) affecting conserved residues in the pro-line-rich region (p.A678V and p.S675C	 Figure 3) which also promote cell proliferation. In fact	 we found similar frequencies of mutations in RING finger and proline-rich domains. The proline-rich region is essential for the interaction of CBL with the adaptor proteins (such as Grb2 and FRs2Î±) needed to maintain a stable attachment between CBL and its substrate	52 with proteins involved in the endocytosis of target receptors (such as SH3KBP1)46 and with several signaling proteins (such as the Src family).46  As in previous studies	 we observed that mock-transfected cells showed greater growth than cells transfected with wild-type CBL	 but less than cells transfected with mutant CBL. This fact is concordant with the proposal by some authors of a dominant negative effect of CBL mutant forms on endogenous wild-type CBL	 making it unable to perform its negative regulatory function and promoting intracellular signaling and higher cell proliferation rates.18	26	27 However	 in vivo studies have shown that the presence of gain-of-function mutants with a dominant effect over endogenous CBL is not enough to develop a myeloproliferative disease.18	26	27 A possible explanation for this phenomenon could be the activity of wild-type CBL as a positive regulator of cell growth contributing to the activation of pathways such as PI3K	 Ras/MAPK and Src.52	53 Under normal conditions	 the negative regulatory activity of CBL could mask its activity as a positive regulator	 but the lack of E3-ubiquitin ligase activity could reveal its signaling enhancing activity.27 This could be the reason for the non-transforming effect of the p.R462W CBLB mutant in 32D(FLT3) cells. CBLB does not show the positive regulatory effects of CBL52 and perhaps the loss of its E3-ubiquitin ligase activity is not enough to promote cell proliferation. In fact	 although CBLB activity seems to be similar to that of CBL in hematologic cells	 very few cases of myeloid neoplasms with CBLB mutations have been reported.25	29  Finally	 the results obtained in CBLC suggest that missense single nucleotide polymorphisms do not increase cell proliferation in our model. Wild-type CBLC induced higher proliferation rates in 32D(FLT3) cells than wild-type CBL in all assays (Online Supplementary Figure S1) possibly due to the absence of an inhibitory role of CBLC in hematologic cells.25	54	55  In conclusion	 we have identified mutations in the proline-rich region of CBL in patients with MPN and also in V617FJAK2-positive patients. Although the entire CBL coding sequence has been investigated in some studies (by sequencing	 not by dHPLC)	18	19	22	32 most research in recent years has focused only on exons coding for the linker region and RING finger domain20	21	23	28	30	31	33â€“36	38 and in patients without other frequent genetic aberrations	 such as mutations in JAK2.26 Proline-rich domain mutations (p.S675C and p.A678V) confer hypersensitivity to cytokines in the 32D(FLT3) model in a similar way to RING finger domain mutations (p.T402HfsX29	 p.C416W and p.P427R)	 suggesting that they should also be considered in analyses of CBL. Although these events seem to be rare in MPN	 our data highlight the importance of reevaluating the prevalence of CBL mutations in other regions of the gene in myeloid neoplasms. This could be of special interest in MDS/MPN because of the high incidence of CBL mutations in these diseases. In addition	 further functional analyses of these genetic events could help us to understand the cellular functions of CBL and the role of the different protein domains. It is well known that CBL activity is mediated by the activation of different RTK	 so the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (such as anti-FLT3) or other signal transduction inhibitors could also be effective in the treatment of patients with CBL mutations.27	32	56																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		
4	8|| Abstract Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is characterized by hypersensitivity to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). SHP2	 NF-1	 KRAS	 and NRAS are mutated in JMML patients	 leading to aberrant regulation of RAS signaling. A subset of JMML patients harbor CBL mutations associated with 11q acquired uniparental disomy. Many of these mutations are in the linker region and the RING finger of CBL	 leading to a loss of E3 ligase activity. We investigated the mechanism by which CBL-Y371H	 a linker region mutant	 and CBL-C384R	 a RING finger mutant	 lead to enhanced GM-CSF signaling. Expression of CBL mutants in the TF-1 cell line resulted in enhanced survival in the absence of GM-CSF. Cells expressing CBL mutations displayed increased phosphorylation of GM-CSF receptor Î²c subunit in response to stimulation	 although expression of total GM-CSFR Î²c was lower. This suggested enhanced kinase activity downstream of GM-CSFR. JAK2 and LYN kinase expression is elevated in CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutant cells	 resulting in enhanced phosphorylation of CBL and S6 in response to GM-CSF stimulation. Incubation with the JAK2 inhibitor	 TG101348	 abolished the increased phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c in cells expressing CBL mutants	 whereas treatment with the SRC kinase inhibitor dasatinib resulted in equalization of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation signal between wild type CBL and CBL mutant samples. Dasatinib treatment inhibited the elevated phosphorylation of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants. Our study indicates that CBL linker and RING finger mutants lead to enhanced GM-CSF signaling due to elevated kinase expression	 which can be blocked using small molecule inhibitors targeting specific downstream pathways.  Keywords: Cytokine	 E3 Ubiquitin Ligase	 JAK Kinase	 Signal Transduction	 SRC	 CBL	 GM-CSF	 Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia Go to: Introduction Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a cytokine that regulates the differentiation	 survival	 proliferation	 and functional activation of granulocytes and monocytes in the myeloid lineage (1). In order to mediate its functional activity	 GM-CSF binds to its receptor	 the GM-CSF receptor (GM-CSFR)	2 consisting of GM-CSR Î± and GM-CSFR Î² common (Î²c) subunits. The Î²c subunit of the receptor is shared by the IL-3 and IL-5 receptors. Î²c is the major signaling subunit and is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to cytokine stimulation. Î²c phosphorylation results in the recruitment of various effectors leading to activation of downstream signaling (2â€“4). GM-CSFR Î± is the major binding subunit	 which dictates the binding specificity of the receptor complex for GM-CSF (2	4	 5). The engagement of GM-CSFR by GM-CSF results in the formation of a dodecameric complex of GM-CSFÂ·GM-CSFR Î±Â·GM-CSFR Î²c	 which leads to the trans-phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c-associated JAK2 kinases (6). The activated JAK2 kinases phosphorylate GM-CSFR Î²c tyrosine residues	 allowing for the recruitment of various effectors and the activation of downstream signaling. GM-CSF stimulation results in the activation of the JAK-STAT	 PI3K	 and the RAS/MAPK pathways	 contributing to GM-CSF-mediated differentiation	 proliferation	 and survival (reviewed in Refs. 1 and 4).  GM-CSF hypersensitivity is one of the defining characteristics of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). This disease is classified by the World Health Organization as a mixed myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease (7). JMML patients must show persistent monocytosis in the absence of the BCR-ABL oncogene (8). Genetic lesions deregulating the RAS signaling pathway have been identified to lead to JMML pathogenesis. 10â€“15% of JMML patients harbor mutations in neurofibromin protein (NF1) (9	 10)	 a GTPase-activating protein	 which negatively regulates RAS by enhancing the hydrolysis of the active GTP-bound conformation of RAS to the inactive GDP-bound form (11). 35% of JMML patients have mutations in SHP2 (12â€“14)	 a protein-tyrosine phosphatase that positively regulates the RAS signaling pathway (15	 16). RAS-activating mutations account for another 20â€“25% of JMML-associated mutations (17â€“19). Several groups determined that a proportion of JMML patients have 11q uniparental disomy. CBL mutations were identified upon further analysis of the 11q uniparental disomy samples (20â€“22). The presence of NF1	 SHP2	 RAS	 and CBL mutations are mutually exclusive	 raising the question of how CBL mutations can lead to disease development.  CBL mutations have been identified in numerous other myeloid malignancies	 including acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic	 myeloproliferative	 and mixed myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease (23â€“28). The majority of these mutations localize to the CBL linker region or the RING finger. CBL is a ubiquitin E3 ligase	 which specifies target proteins for ubiquitination. The linker region and RING finger of CBL play very important roles in its E3 ligase functionality. The linker region contains two conserved tyrosine residues	 Tyr-368 and Tyr-371	 whose phosphorylation activates and positively regulates E3 ligase activity of CBL (29â€“31). The CBL RING finger is responsible for recruiting active E2s carrying an ubiquitin moiety	 allowing for the transfer of ubiquitin to the target substrate (29	 32). Therefore	 it is not surprising that mutations in the linker region and RING finger of CBL identified in myeloid malignancies result in a loss of E3 ligase activity.  JMML is associated with GM-CSF hypersensitivity; however	 there is a lack of evidence that specifically examines the role of CBL downstream of the GM-CSF receptor and how JMML-associated CBL mutations may affect GM-CSF signaling. CBL is known to become phosphorylated downstream of the Î²c in response to stimulation by IL-3 (33	 34) and GM-CSF (35	 36). Furthermore	 CBL associates with the Î²c subunit upon IL-5 stimulation (37). However	 these studies do not directly address the role of CBL in GM-CSF signaling.  The objective of this study is to investigate how JMML-associated CBL mutations modulate GM-CSF signaling and lead to GM-CSF hypersensitivity. We expressed wild type CBL	 CBL-Y371H	 and CBL-C384R in the human TF-1 hematopoietic cell line	 which expresses the endogenous GM-CSF receptor at physiological levels (38). Upon GM-CSF stimulation	 elevated phosphorylation of GM-CSF Î²c was observed	 resulting from elevated JAK2 and LYN phosphorylation. Expression of CBL JMML mutants resulted in enhanced S6 phosphorylation and increased cell survival. Treatment with pharmacologic inhibitors delineated which proximal GM-CSF-dependent pathways are dependent on JAK2 and LYN activation. In summary	 our data show that CBL JMML mutants result in enhanced GM-CSF signaling via modulation of JAK2 and LYN tyrosine kinases.  Go to: EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Constructs pMSCV-HA-CBL retroviral vectors were used to create JMML-associated CBL mutants. HA-tagged CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R were constructed using QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kits (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol.  Retrovirus Production HEK 293T cells were plated onto 10-cm dishes (Sarstedt) and grown to around 75% confluence. The 293T cells were transiently transfected with pSV (Gag and Pol proteins) and pVSV-G (envelope protein) and pMSCV-GFP retroviral vectors expressing HA-wild type CBL	 HA-CBL-Y371H	 or HA-CBL-C384R using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as directed in the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly	 4.5 Î¼g of pSV	 1.5 Î¼g of VSV-G	 and 4.5 Î¼g of pMSCV-IRES-GFP-HA-CBL constructs were mixed with Lipofectamine 2000 in serum- and antibiotic-free DMEM H-21 for 20 min at room temperature. 293T cells were washed with serum-free DMEM H-21	 and 4 ml of serum- and antibiotic-free DMEM H-21 was added to the cells. DNA-Lipofectamine 2000 mixture was added to the plated cells and incubated for 6 h at 37 Â°C. Transfection medium was removed from the cells	 and 10 ml of RPMI 1640 medium with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum was added. Transfected 293T supernatant containing VSV-G pseudotyped virus carrying pMSCV-HA-CBL was collected at 48 and 72 h post-transfection.  Cell Lines and Culture TF-1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium	 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum	 100 units of penicillin/ml	 100 Î¼g of streptomycin/ml	 and 2 ng/ml recombinant human GM-CSF. In order to stably express wild type and mutant CBL	 TF-1 cells were infected with VSV-G pseudotyped retrovirus carrying wild type CBL	 CBL-Y371H	 and CBL-C384R constructs. TF-1 cells were suspended in retroviral supernatant supplemented with 8 ng/ml Polybrene and centrifuged in 50-ml tubes at 12	000 rpm for 75 min. TF-1 cells were resuspended in fresh retroviral Polybrene solution and incubated overnight in 6-well dishes at 37 Â°C. A final round of spinoculation with fresh retroviral supernatant was performed on day 2. TF-1 cells were allowed to expand for 48 h. GFP-positive infected TF-1 cells expressing HA-CBL constructs were purified using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).  XTT Assay TF-1 cells were cytokine-depleted overnight	 as described below. 2000 cells were transferred to each well of a 96-well plate in a final volume of 100 Î¼l of RPMI	 10% FCS with the indicated concentrations of GM-CSF. Plates were incubated at 37 Â°C for 48 h prior to the addition of 3 Î¼m phenazine methosulfate (Sigma) and 2 mg/ml XTT (Diagnostic Chemicals). The cells were incubated with the XTT/phenazine methosulfate solution for 6 h at 37 Â°C. The absorption of the reduction product at 450 nm was measured using a spectrophotometer plate reader.  Annexin V Flow Cytometric Analysis TF-1 cells were cytokine-depleted and maintained in cytokine-free media for 72 h. Cells were stained with annexin V-phycoerythrin (PE) according to the manufacturer's protocol (BD Pharmingen). Stained cells were analyzed using a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur flow cytometer.  Cytokine Deprivation	 Stimulation	 and Lysis TF-1 cells were washed three times in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)	 Hanks' balanced salts; depleted in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum overnight at 37 Â°C; and then stimulated with 0.5 ng/ml recombinant human GM-CSF. Proteasomal and lysosomal degradation was inhibited by incubation of cells with 30 Î¼m MG132 (Calbiochem/Millipore) and 100 Î¼m chloroquine (Sigma)	 respectively	 for 2 h prior to stimulation. JAK2 and LYN kinase activity was inhibited by treatment with 2 m TG101348 (generously provided by Dr. R. Levine) for 4 h or with 0.1 m dasatinib (gift from Dr. D. Hedley) for 2 h	 respectively. TF-1 cells were stimulated with 0.5 ng/ml recombinant human GM-CSF for the indicated times at 37 Â°C.  The cells were washed once in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)	 Hanks' balanced salts containing 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate	 10 mm sodium fluoride	 10 mm EDTA	 and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100	 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)	 150 mm NaCl	 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate	 10 mm sodium fluoride	 10 mm EDTA	 1 mm sodium orthovanadate	 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and supplemented with â€œcOmpleteâ€ protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science). After 5 min on ice	 the lysates were centrifuged at 10	000 Ã— g for 5 min at 4 Â°C.  Antibodies The 4G10 phosphotyrosine-specific monoclonal antibody and anti-ERK1/2 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology/Millipore. Anti-IL-3/IL-5/GM-CSFR Î²c N-20 (used for immunoblotting) and K-17 (used for immunoprecipitations))	 anti-Shp2	 and anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology	 Inc. (Santa Cruz	 CA). Antibodies specific for phospho-JAK2 (Tyr-1007/1008)	 JAK2	 phospho-SRC family (Tyr-416)	 phospho-Ser-235/236 S6	 and Lynp56 were acquired from Cell Signaling Technologies. An anti-phospho STAT5a/b antibodies were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc./Invitrogen. Anti-STAT5 antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences. The monoclonal 12CA5 anti-HA antibody was acquired from Roche Applied Science.  Immunoprecipitations Antibodies along with a 50-Î¼l volume of protein A or protein G-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added to 2 mg of lysates for an overnight incubation at 4 Â°C. The beads were washed three times in ice-cold lysis buffer. The immune complexes were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm DTT. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane for Western blotting.  Western Blotting Following the electrophoretic transfer of proteins to PVDF membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences)	 the membranes were blocked at room temperature with 2.5% BSA (w/v) or 5% nonfat dry milk (w/v) in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 150 mm NaCl) with Tween 20 for 1 h. Membranes were then incubated with an optimal concentration of the primary antibody in Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 Â°C. Membranes were washed four times in TBST and incubated with the relevant HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 30â€“60 min. Membranes were washed four times in TBST and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence with autoradiographic film (ECL	 Amersham Biosciences). For reprobing	 membranes were stripped in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8)	 2% SDS	 and 0.1 m Î²-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 50 Â°C; rinsed twice in TBST; and blocked in 2.5% BSA in Tris-buffered saline prior to primary antibody incubation. Western blots were scanned and quantified using ImageJ software. Quantified Western blots are presented as mean Â± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test.  Go to: RESULTS Enhanced and Prolonged Phosphorylation of the GM-CSFR Î²c in CBL Mutant-expressing Cells GM-CSF hypersensitivity is one of the hallmark features of JMML (39). We utilized the TF-1 hematopoietic cell line to investigate the role of JMML-associated CBL mutations in vitro. TF-1 cells endogenously express the GM-CSF receptor Î± (GM-CSFRÎ±) and the IL-3/IL-5/GM-CSF receptor Î² common chain (GM-CSFR Î²c)	 and are responsive to GM-CSF. HA-tagged wild type CBL	 CBL-Y371H	 and CBL-C384R mutants were stably expressed in TF-1 cells (Fig. 1A). All exogenous constructs showed high expression of CBL when compared with vector-infected cells (Fig. 1A). This is especially advantageous because studies have shown that expression of wild type CBL can rescue or mask the effects of CBL mutants (23	 40).  FIGURE 1. FIGURE 1. Enhanced phosphorylation of GM-CSF receptor Î²c upon expression of CBL mutants. A	 lysates from parental TF-1 cells as well as from TF-1 cells expressing wild type CBL	 CBL-Y371H	 and CBL-C384R were probed for CBL expression. IB	 immunoblot. B ... Binding of GM-CSF to the GM-CSF receptor complex activates JAK2	 leading to the tyrosine phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c. In order to investigate the effects of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants on GM-CSF signaling	 we examined the phosphorylation of the GM-CSFR Î²c after stimulation. TF-1 cells expressing wild type CBL	 CBL-Y371H	 and CBL-C384R were cytokine-depleted and stimulated with GM-CSF. GM-CSFR Î²c was immunoprecipitated from lysates and immunoblotted with the 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Upon GM-CSF stimulation	 cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants (Fig. 1B	 lanes 5 and 6 and lanes 8 and 9) show enhanced phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c compared with the wild type CBL controls (lanes 2 and 3). Furthermore	 prolonged phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c was observed in CBL mutant samples.  CBL plays an important role in stimulation-induced endocytosis	 trafficking	 and degradation of numerous tyrosine kinase (29	 32) and cytokine receptors (41	 42). To determine whether expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants has an effect on the expression of the GM-CSFR Î²c	 as well as its GM-CSF induced degradation	 lysates collected from GM-CSF-stimulated TF-1 cells were probed for GM-CSFR Î²c. Because it is likely that CBL-Y371H (23	 30) and CBL-C384R (43) mutations result in a loss of CBL E3 ligase activity	 GM-CSFR Î²c levels were expected to be higher in mutant CBL-expressing cells. Surprisingly	 expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R (Fig. 2A	 lanes 4â€“9) results in a decrease in GM-CSFR Î²c compared with wild type CBL (lanes 1â€“3)-expressing cells at 0	10	 and 60 min (Fig. 2B). However	 it is important to note that GM-CSFR Î²c expression decreased after GM-CSF stimulation in wild type and mutant CBL-expressing cells at comparable rates. These results indicate that although expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R results in an overall decreased expression of GM-CSFR Î²c	 the degradation of the receptor poststimulation appears not to be disrupted.  FIGURE 2. FIGURE 2. TF-1 cells expressing CBL mutants have lower expression levels of GM-CSFR Î²c. Lysates were collected as described in the legend to Fig. 1. A	 immunoblotting (IB) was performed with GM-CSFR Î²c-specific antibody. Blots were reprobed for ... Elevated Levels of JAK2 Kinase in CBL-Y371H- and CBL-C384R-expressing TF-1 Cells Upon binding of GM-CSF to GM-CSFRÎ±	 a GM-CSFR Î²c homodimer is recruited (6)	 bringing the Î²c-associated JAK2 kinase (44	 45) into close proximity	 allowing transphosphorylation and subsequent activation of the kinase. Activation of JAK2 is essential for downstream GM-CSF signaling (46	 47). The enhanced and prolonged phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c	 along with a decrease in the overall expression of the receptor in CBL mutant-expressing cells may be indicative of elevated kinase activity downstream of GM-CSFR Î²c. Because JAK2 is the main tyrosine kinase downstream of GM-CSFR	 the GM-CSF-induced activation of JAK2 was assessed. TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R displayed elevated levels of phosphorylated JAK2 upon GM-CSF stimulation (Fig. 3A	 top	 lanes 5 and 6 and lanes 8 and 9)	 compared with the wild type CBL controls (lanes 2 and 3). Reprobing for total JAK2	 revealed that the observed enhancement of the phospho-JAK2 signal may be due to an increase in the expression of JAK2 in CBL mutant-expressing cells (Fig. 3	 A (middle	 lanes 4â€“9) and B).  FIGURE 3. FIGURE 3. Expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants results in elevated JAK2. A	 lysates collected from TF-1 cells expressing wild type and CBL mutants were probed for phospho-Tyr-1007/1008 JAK2 and reprobed for total JAK2 and tubulin. B	 blots were quantified ... Linker and RING finger mutations disrupt the E3 ligase activity of CBL (29	31	 32). Such loss of E3 ligase activity has been shown to result in a significant decrease in the EPO-induced ubiquitination of JAK2 (23). In order to determine whether the increase in total JAK2 in CBL mutant expressing cell lines was due to compromised ubiquitination and degradation of the kinase	 TF-1 cells expressing wild type CBL	 CBL-Y371H	 and CBL-C384R were treated with proteasomal (MG-132) and lysosomal (chloroquine) inhibitors prior to stimulation. Inhibition of proteasomal and lysosomal degradation stabilized JAK2 to comparable levels in all three cell lines (Fig. 3C	 middle). These results indicate that the expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants affects the degradation of JAK2	 leading to elevated levels	 which in turn contribute to increased JAK2 phosphorylation and potentially signaling in response to GM-CSF stimulation.  Increased Expression of LYN Kinase in CBL Mutant Cells Although JAK2 is the primary kinase activated downstream of GM-CSF receptor	 members of the SRC family kinase are stimulated in response to GM-CSF (48â€“50). Specifically	 LYN has been shown to directly associate with GM-CSFR Î²c (51) and to play an important role in mediating the anti-apoptotic effects of GM-CSF in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (49	 52). LYN also associates with GM-CSFRÎ± and is involved in the survival signal required for factor-independent growth of cells expressing the FIÎ” GM-CSFR Î²c mutant (48). Considering that TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R show enhanced survival while exhibiting lower expression of GM-CSFR Î²c	 we wanted to determine whether LYN phosphorylation and/or expression was altered in CBL mutant-expressing cells. Lysates collected from GM-CSF-stimulated cells were probed with an antibody specific for pY396-LYN	 residing in a phosphorylated motif within the LYN activation loop. Increased LYN phosphorylation was observed in cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants (Fig. 4A	 top	 lanes 4â€“9)	 compared with those expressing wild type CBL (lanes 1â€“3). Reprobing for total LYN revealed that CBL mutant cells have increased levels of LYN (p56) (Fig. 4	 A (middle	 lanes 4â€“9) and B). This observed increase in LYN expression leads to elevated LYN phosphorylation	 which may contribute to the enhanced survival of CBL mutant TF-1 cells.  FIGURE 4. FIGURE 4. Increased expression of LYN kinase in CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutant TF-1 cells. A	 whole cell lysates collected from TF-1 cells expressing CBL-WT and CBL mutants were immunoblotted with antibodies specific for Tyr(P)-396-LYN. Blots were reprobed for ... Similar to JAK2	 treatment with MG-132 and chloroquine stabilized total LYN levels to comparable levels in wild type and mutant cells	 indicating that the increase in LYN levels is probably due to the loss of E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the CBL mutants (Fig. 4C).  Expression of CBL Mutants Results in Constitutive S6 Phosphorylation and Enhanced Factor-free Survival Investigation of signaling effectors further downstream of the GM-CSF receptor revealed enhanced phosphorylation of SHP2 in CBL mutant-expressing cells relative to wild type CBL controls (Fig. 5A). Constitutive phosphorylation of S6 in TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R	 compared with wild type CBL-expressing controls (Fig. 5B)	 was also observed. No significant differences were observed in the phosphorylation of STAT5 or ERK1/2 (Fig. 5C) between wild type CBL- and mutant CBL-expressing TF-1 cells after GM-CSF stimulation.  FIGURE 5. FIGURE 5. Expression of CBL mutants results in constitutive phosphorylation of S6 and enhanced survival of TF-1 cells. A	 SHP2 immunoprecipitations (IP) were performed on lysates collected from TF-1 cells expressing CBL-WT	 CBL-Y371H	 and CBL-C384R	 which were ... XTT assays were performed to determine whether the expression of the CBL linker and RING finger mutants results in enhanced survival and growth. TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants displayed enhanced survival in the absence of GM-CSF relative to cells expressing wild type CBL (Fig. 5D). The increase in the survival of the mutant-expressing cells decreases with increasing concentration of GM-CSF. Cell counting assays were also performed to confirm these results (data not shown). To determine whether the increase in survival was due to a decrease in apoptosis	 annexin V staining was performed on cytokine-deprived wild type and mutant CBL-expressing cells. There was a decrease in annexin V-positive TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H relative to wild type CBL-expressing controls	 whereas the proportion of annexin V-positive CBL-C384R-expressing cells was comparable with wild type CBL controls (Fig. 5E). These results indicate that JMML-associated CBL mutations result in enhanced survival of TF-1 cells at low doses of GM-CSF.  Constitutive and Enhanced Phosphorylation of CBL Mutants Is Dependent on an SRC Family Kinase CBL is phosphorylated downstream of numerous oncogenic protein-tyrosine kinases (BCR/ABL and v-SRC)	 receptor tyrosine kinases (PDGF-R	 FLT-3	 and c-KIT)	 and cytokine receptors (TPO and EPO) (reviewed in Ref. 53). For example	 CBL is tyrosine-phosphorylated downstream of the Î²c chain in response to IL-3 (33	 34) and GM-CSF (35	 36).  The carboxyl-terminal region of CBL contains three major tyrosine phosphorylation sites	 Tyr-700	 Tyr-731	 and Tyr-774 (54). Phosphorylation of these tyrosines leads to the recruitment of SRC homology 2 domain-containing effectors. Phosphorylated Tyr-700 of CBL binds the guanine nucleotide exchange factor	 VAV (55). Phosphorylated Tyr-731 acts as the binding site for the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K (56	 57)	 and members of the CRK adaptor protein family have been shown to bind both phosphorylated Tyr-700 and Tyr-774 (58â€“60). Downstream pathways mediated by CBL tyrosine phosphorylation sites play an important role in CBL-mediated signaling. Linker region mutations of CBL have been shown to lead to enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL in Ba/F3-FLT3 cells (24).  We were interested in determining whether expression of the linker region Y371H and the RING finger C384R mutations would result in altered CBL tyrosine phosphorylation. CBL was immunoprecipitated from wild type and mutant CBL TF-1 lysates	 and phosphorylation was assessed by Tyr(P) immunoblotting (Fig. 6). CBL-Y371H (lanes 4â€“6) and CBL-C384R (lanes 7â€“9) were highly phosphorylated compared with CBL wild type controls (lanes 1â€“3). Both CBL mutants showed constitutive phosphorylation in the absence of GM-CSF stimulation (lanes 4 and 7).  FIGURE 6. FIGURE 6. Dasatinib treatment abolishes the enhanced phosphorylation of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R. TF-1 cells expressing WT and mutant CBL were incubated with dasatinib and TG101348 for 2 and 4 h	 respectively	 prior to GM-CSF stimulation. Cells were lysed	 and HA ... Although numerous members of the SRC family kinases	 including LYN (61â€“63)	 are capable of phosphorylating CBL	 there is evidence that Janus kinase family members may also target CBL for tyrosine phosphorylation (64). To determine whether inhibition of JAK2 or SRC family kinases could abolish the enhanced and constitutive phosphorylation of CBL	 TF-1 cells expressing wild type and mutant CBL were treated with either the JAK2-specific inhibitor TG101348 or the SRC family kinase inhibitor dasatinib prior to stimulation. The constitutive and enhanced phosphorylation of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants (lanes 22â€“27) persisted in TG101348-treated samples (Fig. 6)	 whereas pretreatment with dasatinib abolished the elevated phosphorylation of CBL mutants (lanes 13â€“18) to levels comparable with wild type CBL controls (lanes 10â€“12). These results indicate that downstream of the GM-CSF receptor	 CBL is phosphorylated by a SRC family kinase	 potentially LYN	 and mutations in the linker region or the RING finger domain of CBL lead to not only enhanced but also constitutive phosphorylation of CBL.  TG101348-mediated Inhibition of Enhanced Phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c in CBL Mutant-expressing Cells We were interested in determining how the inhibition of JAK2 or SRC family kinases downstream of GM-CSFR would modulate the elevated phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c observed in CBL mutant-expressing cells (Figs. 1B and â€‹and7	7	 lanes 1â€“9). TF-1 cells were treated with TG101348 and dasatinib	 alone or in combination	 prior to stimulation and subsequent GM-CSFR Î²c immunoprecipitation. TG101348 treatment resulted in a significant inhibition of GM-CSF-induced phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c in both wild type CBL- and CBL mutant-expressing cells	 resulting in an equally down-modulated level of the phosphorylated receptor (Fig. 7	 lanes 10â€“18). This was expected	 because JAK2 is known to be the kinase responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of the GM-CSFR Î²c in response to stimulation (47	65	 66).  FIGURE 7. FIGURE 7. Inhibition of JAK2 activity via treatment with TG101348 abolishes the enhanced phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î² in CBL mutant-expressing cells. TF-1 cells expressing WT-CBL	 CBL-Y371H	 and CBL-C384R were cytokine-depleted and treated with 2 mm TG101348 ... Interestingly	 inhibition of SRC family kinases did not result in the inhibition of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation	 but it did result in an equivalent level of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation in wild type CBL and CBL mutant samples (Fig. 7	 lanes 19â€“27). Treatment with both TG101348 and dasatinib inhibited GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation (Fig. 7	 lanes 28â€“36) to similar levels observed in samples treated with only TG101348.  Go to: DISCUSSION Hypersensitivity to GM-CSF is one of the defining characteristics of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Until recently	 genes mutated in JMML patients (NF1	 SHP2	 NRAS	 and KRAS) were directly involved in the RAS signaling pathway. The Loh and Maciejewski groups (20â€“22) found that 10â€“15% of JMML patients have mutations in CBL and that these mutations are associated with acquired uniparental disomy. The majority of CBL mutations identified clustered in the linker region and RING finger	 both of which play an important role in the E3 ligase activity of CBL. The identification of these JMML-associated CBL mutations raised a number of questions about the role of CBL downstream of GM-CSF receptor	 whether CBL is involved in RAS signaling downstream of GM-CSFR	 and how mutations in CBL can lead to hypersensitivity to GM-CSF. In order to address these questions	 we utilized the TF-1 hematopoietic cell line	 which is GM-CSF-responsive (38) and has a low endogenous CBL expression. To examine the functional consequences of CBL linker region mutations	 we expressed CBL-Y371H linker and CBL-C384R RING finger mutants	 because these are two of the most common CBL mutations observed in JMML patients (21	 22).  We found that expression of these CBL mutants in GM-CSF-stimulated TF-1 cells leads to enhanced and prolonged phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c	 which occurred concurrently with elevated expression of both JAK2 and LYN. Assessment of downstream signaling revealed enhanced phosphorylation of S6 in CBL-Y371H- and CBL-C384R-expressing cells relative to wild type CBL controls. TF-1 cells expressing CBL mutations showed enhanced survival in the absence of GM-CSF	 and specifically in the case of CBL-Y371H-expressing cells	 this is probably due to a decrease in induction of apoptosis. We also observed elevated and constitutive phosphorylation of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants	 which was inhibited upon treatment with dasatinib	 an SRC family kinase inhibitor. Interestingly	 treatment with dasatinib also led to equalization of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation between wild type CBL- and CBL mutant-expressing cells. However	 inhibition of JAK2 activity by TG101348 resulted in complete inhibition of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation in CBL mutant and wild type CBL control cells.  Expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants results in prolonged and elevated receptor tyrosine phosphorylation	 which supports the observed enhancement in survival (67). Martinez-Moczygemba and Huston (37	 68)	 using the IL-5 receptor as a model for Î²c subunit-sharing cytokine receptors (IL-3/IL-5/GM-CSF)	 demonstrated that increased Î²c subunit ubiquitination is observed after stimulation. This ubiquitination event leads to the proteasomal degradation of the cytoplasmic tail of the Î²c subunit	 which attenuates downstream signaling (37	 68). They also found that the ubiquitination of the Î²c subunit may be mediated by CBL	 because the E3 ligase was co-immunoprecipitated with the Î²c subunit. The loss of E3 ligase activity of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants may prevent GM-CSFR Î²c ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the cytoplasmic region of the receptor and culminate in the observed enhancement of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation and elevated levels of JAK2. However	 this is unlikely	 because we have observed total levels of GM-CSFR Î²c to be lower in CBL mutant cells. Alternatively	 increased JAK2 and LYN expression could be correlated with a negative feedback loop that down-regulates GM-CSFR Î²c levels in TF-1 cells. The ubiquitination of Î²c in response to IL-5 stimulation is dependent on JAK2 activity (68	 69). In CBL-Y371H- and CBL-C384R-expressing cells	 the enhanced JAK2 activity can potentially lead to increased ubiquitination of the Î²c by other ubiquitin ligases	 resulting in decreased overall expression of the receptor subunit.  JAK2 is also regulated via CBL-mediated ubiquitination (23	 70). The expression of CBL mutants Y371H and C384R may result in decreased ubiquitination of JAK2	 culminating in elevated levels of JAK2 as well as enhanced JAK2-mediated phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c. We found that in CBL mutant cells	 there was elevated expression of JAK2 kinase	 which was abolished upon treatment with proteasomal and lysosomal inhibitors.  Similar to JAK2	 several members of the SRC family kinases (71)	 including LYN	 have been shown to be ubiquitinated (72) by CBL (73	 74). The enhanced expression of LYN in TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R indicates that	 downstream of GM-CSFR	 CBL is responsible for LYN ubiquitination. LYN mediates the tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL downstream of Î²1 integrin (61)	 granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) (62	 75)	 and the B-cell antigen receptor (63	 76). We have observed enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants	 which is abolished upon treatment with the SRC family kinase inhibitor dasatinib. This confirms that LYN is a kinase responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL downstream of the GM-CSFR	 and the enhanced phosphorylation of CBL mutants may be a functional consequence of the elevated levels of LYN in CBL mutant-expressing cells.  Phosphorylation of CBL Tyr-731 leads to the activation of the PI3K pathway via recruitment of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K (54	 56). The Corey group (62	 77) has shown that LYN couples to the PI3K pathway in a CBL-dependent manner	 whereby activated LYN binds and phosphorylates CBL	 allowing for the recruitment of p85 to the complex. LYN also activates the PI3K pathway downstream of GM-CSFR Î± (48)	 promoting cell survival. We have shown that expression of CBL JMML mutants defective in E3 ubiquitin ligase activity leads to aberrant regulation of LYN downstream of GM-CSFR	 which ultimately leads to constitutive and enhanced phosphorylation of S6	 suggesting elevated PI3K pathway activity. Interestingly	 basal activation of S6 has been observed in mononuclear cells isolated from JMML patients (78). Furthermore	 in the absence of LYN	 the antiapoptotic effects of GM-CSF are abolished (49	 52). At low concentrations of GM-CSF	 the signaling pathways activated downstream of the receptor lead to cell survival only	 whereas stimulation with higher doses results in cell proliferation and cell survival (79). We have shown that expression of CBL mutants results in enhanced survival	 especially at low doses	 or in the complete absence of GM-CSF in TF-1 cells. These data suggest that CBL linker and RING finger mutants lower the threshold concentration of GM-CSF required to induce cell survival. Together	 these results suggest that in CBL-Y371H- and CBL-C384R-expressing cells	 the modulation of the PI3-K pathway due to the increase in LYN levels may be contributing to the observed enhancement of survival in the absence of GM-CSF.  The mechanism by which these mutations lead to elevated GM-CSF signaling and enhanced survival depends on the role of CBL as both an E3 ligase and an adaptor protein. CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants compromise the E3 ligase activity of CBL. We have shown that these loss-of-function mutations lead to increased levels of JAK2 and LYN kinases downstream of the GM-CSFR	 potentially due to loss of ubiquitination of the kinases or to the inhibition of GM-CSFR Î²c ubiquitination and cytoplasmic domain degradation. These events contribute to the elevated levels of GM-CSF signaling observed in CBL mutant-expressing TF-1 cells. Sanada et al. (23) have shown that Cblâˆ’/âˆ’ LSK cells show a mild cytokine hypersensitivity	 but transformation of Cblâˆ’/âˆ’ LSK cells with Cbl linker region mutants significantly enhances the cytokine hypersensitivity	 indicating a gain-of-function of the mutants that cannot be ascribed to a simple loss of CBL E3 ligase activity. Inhibition of Cbl-b function by mutant Cbl has been proposed as a possible mechanism (80	 81). However	 it is possible that functionality of CBL as an adaptor protein may be contributing to the gain of function of the mutants. Our group	 as well as others	 has shown that expression of CBL linker and RING finger mutants results in enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL (24	81	 82). This increase in CBL phosphorylation culminates in enhanced PI3K and RAS pathway activation. We found that treatment with dasatinib results in loss of CBL phosphorylation. Interestingly	 dasatinib treatment equalized GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation in wild type- and CBL mutant-expressing TF-1 cells. Therefore	 dasatinib treatment may decouple the gain-of-function capacity of CBL mutants from the loss of E3 ligase activity. Considering that treatment with JAK2 inhibitor	 TG101348	 results in complete inhibition of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation	 dasatinib may provide a treatment option for the enhanced signaling driven by CBL gain-of-function mutations.  Prior studies have shown that expression of CBL linker region and RING finger mutants inhibits stimulation-induced ubiquitination of the EGF-R (23	 29)	 FLT3	 c-KIT	 and JAK2 (downstream of EPO-R) (23). Niemeyer et al. (40) have shown that expression of CBL linker region mutants in Ba/F3-EPO-R cells results in an enhanced phosphorylation of ERK1/2	 AKT	 and S6. In Ba/F3 cells expressing the FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase	 expression of CBL-Y371 mutants leads to elevated FLT3 phosphorylation as well as AKT and STAT5 (24). Although these studies are useful to probe how CBL mutations perturb FLT3 signaling in AML	 no studies have examined the role of CBL JMML mutations in GM-CSF-dependent signaling pathways to date. Our analysis reveals that expression of CBL-Y371H or CBL-C384R in TF-1 cells generates GM-CSF hypersensitivity that affects proximal steps in receptor activation	 including GM-CSFR Î²c	 JAK2	 and LYN coupling to PI3K activation. Unlike with the Ba/F3 results	 we failed to observe effects on ERK1/2 or STAT5 activation. Whether this is a function of the unique receptor systems or distinct cell lines remains to be determined.  In conclusion	 these studies have confirmed that CBL plays a negative regulatory role downstream of GM-CSFR. We have shown that the enhancement of GM-CSF signaling observed upon loss of CBL E3 ligase activity is due to increased stability of JAK2 and LYN. These results provide in vitro support for further investigation into the applicability of JAK2 and SRC family kinase inhibitors for use in treatment of myeloid malignancies associated with CBL linker region and RING finger mutations. Oncogenic mutations in the monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) gene have been found in many tumors	 but their significance remains largely unknown. Several human c-Cbl (CBL) structures have recently been solved depicting the protein at different stages of its activation cycle and thus provide mechanistic insight underlying how stability-activity tradeoffs in cancer-related proteins may influence disease onset and progression. In this study	 we computationally modeled the effects of missense cancer mutations on structures representing four stages of the CBL activation cycle to identify driver mutations that affect CBL stability	 binding	 and activity. We found that recurrent	 homozygous	 and leukemia-specific mutations had greater destabilizing effects on CBL states than did random non-cancer mutations. We further tested the ability of these computational models assessing the changes in CBL stability and its binding to ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2	 by performing blind CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays in cells. Experimental CBL ubiquitin ligase activity was in agreement with the predicted changes in CBL stability and	 to a lesser extent	 with CBL-E2 binding affinity. Two-thirds of all experimentally tested mutations affected the ubiquitin ligase activity by either destabilizing CBL or disrupting CBL-E2 binding	 whereas about one-third of tested mutations were found to be neutral. Collectively	 our findings demonstrate that computational methods incorporating multiple protein conformations and stability and binding affinity evaluations can successfully predict the functional consequences of cancer mutations on protein activity	 and provide a proof of concept for mutations in CBL.  Keywords: CBL	 driver mutations	 protein interactions Go to: Introduction Whole exome sequencing of cancer patients has produced unprecedented amounts of data to analyze and interpret; these studies report a very large fraction of missense mutations which can potentially be implicated in tumorigenensis (1). Although some missense mutations can provide selective growth advantage to tumor cells (driver mutations)	 the large majority of them are considered to be neutral (passenger mutations). The mechanisms by which the driver variants may affect protein stability	 interactions	 and function remain largely unknown. Various computational methods have been developed to estimate the impacts of disease mutations on proteins but most of them exclusively use sequence features and do not explicitly utilize the protein three-dimensional structures	 their physico-chemical properties and dynamics (2	 3). Many cancers are characterized by (de)activation of certain proteins which may be a result of missense mutations (4). The interconversion between active and inactive states is highly regulated in proteins and it is not well understood how these regulatory mechanisms are disrupted in cancer. The development of in silico approaches to estimate the effects of disease mutations on protein activity	 stability and binding will help to define which are likely to be driver or passenger mutations. Moreover	 understanding the mechanisms of their actions would allow for prioritization of potential driver candidates for better targeted therapies to design drugs which might in turn compensate for the reduced/enhanced protein stability or activity.  The monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) RING finger ubiquitin ligase (E3) represents an exceptionally difficult yet important system to study the mechanisms of cancer mutations (5	 6). Strikingly	 proteins from this family play both positive and negative regulatory roles in tyrosine kinase signaling which is aberrantly activated in many cancers (5). Oncogenic mutations in the c-Cbl gene (referred to as CBL thereafter) were found in human myeloid neoplasms and other tumors (5) but the significance of these mutations and their impacts on CBL function were studied only for very few mutants (7). The mechanistic aspects of CBL cancer mutations can now be adequately addressed as several CBL structures have become available which represent the snapshots of different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1). All CBL proteins share a highly conserved N-terminus which includes a tyrosine kinaseâ€“binding domain (TKBD)	 a linker helix region (LHR) and a RING finger domain	 while the C-terminus comprises a proline-rich region (8). The RING domain of CBL has E3 activity and ubiquitinates activated receptor tyrosine kinases which subsequently targets them for degradation (8). At the same time	 since CBL proteins can bind to activated receptor tyrosine kinases via the TKBD domain	 they can serve as adaptors by recruiting downstream signal transduction components such as SHP2 and P13K (9	 10).  Figure 1 Figure 1 CBL activation cycle. The structures representing the activation cycle of CBL are shown. In the inactive closed state (nCBL) the protein exists in the cytosol. Upon activation of the RTK	 CBL can bind to the phosphorylated RTK (orange peptide) via TKBD ... Another aspect of CBL function which should be accounted for in modeling the effects of cancer mutations is that it can bind to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) in complex with ubiquitin (Ub) and a substrate protein	 thereby facilitating the transfer of Ub from E2 to a lysine residue of the substrate (11). The crystal structure of the inactive complex of CBL with E2 (UbcH7) was solved more than ten years ago (12) while the active phosphorylated CBL-E2 (UbcH5B) complex was resolved fairly recently (13). According to the latter study	 substrate binding and Tyr371 phosphorylation activates CBL by producing a large conformational change in order to place the RING domain and E2 in close proximity to the substrate. It was further confirmed that phosphorylation-induced conformational change is required for positioning of ubiquitin for effective catalysis (14).  Here we present a new approach	 which aims to assess the effects of cancer mutations on stability	 binding and activity of cancer related proteins. We apply computational models to four different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1) and perform blind in vivo experiments of CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination. We show a rather remarkable agreement of experimental EGFR ubiquitination by CBL mutants with the computed changes in CBL thermodynamic stability and to a lesser extent with CBL-E2 binding affinity. The computational models not only quantitatively predict the magnitude of the effects of mutations but also shed light on the mechanisms of their action. Namely	 we find that cancer mutations have greater destabilizing effects on four CBL states than random non-cancer mutations for recurrent	 homozygous and leukemia mutations. Most damaging cancer mutations happen in the sites involved in Zn-coordination and in the formation of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds within CBL or between CBL and E2. Overall cancer driver mutations affect different or multiple stages of the CBL activation cycle either completely abolishing its E3 activity or partially attenuating it. The computational models based on stability and binding affinity calculations can discriminate experimentally validated driver from passenger mutations (with the exception of two mutations) and outperform several state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods aiming to predict phenotypic impacts of mutations.  Go to: Materials and Methods Computational modeling and analysis  Mapping of CBL mutations The COSMIC database (15) stores data on somatic cancer mutations and integrates the experimental data from full-genome sequencing studies. We extracted 103 missense mutations for the CBL gene from the COSMIC database (15) that could be mapped to four available CBL structures in its activation cycle (Fig. 1). Cancer mutations were classified into different classes according to the frequency of observed samples (single and recurrent mutations)	 zygosity (homo- and heterozygous mutations)	 types of cancer (leukemia and sarcoma) and the involvement of mutations in Zn-coordination (Table S1). In addition	 all possible single nucleotide substitutions resulting in amino-acid changes in the CBL gene were performed to obtain a â€œRandomâ€ missense mutation reference set. After excluding mutations observed in COSMIC and mutations occurring on residues without known coordinates in crystal structures	 we obtained 2	102 random missense mutations (Table S1). We also searched the dbSNP database (16) but found very few benign variations in the CBL gene. Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.  Model preparation We investigated the effects of mutations on four states of the CBL activation cycle: (1) closed CBL state (nCBL)	 (2) partially opened CBL state bound to substrate (CBL-S)	 (3) unphosphorylated autoinhibitory CBL bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and (4) phosphorylated CBL bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1). It was previously noted that both UbcH5B and UbcH7 can bind specifically to CBL but only UbcH5B can facilitate ubiquitination (17). The crystal structures of nCBL (PDB id: 2Y1M) (13)	 CBL-S (PDB id: 2Y1N) (13) and pCBL-E2-S (PDB id: 4A4C) (13) were obtained directly from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (18). Only one crystal structure of the unphosphorylated inactive state of CBL bound to E2 (UbcH7) and Zap-70 peptide (PDB id: 1FBV) (12) was available in PDB. Although sequence identity between UbcH7 and UbcH5B proteins is 38%	 the structural similarity is very high with the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.04 Ã…. The unphosphorylated autoinhibitory structure of CBL-UbcH5B-S was therefore modeled based on CBL-UbcH7-S (PDB id: 1FBV) using Chimera (19). (Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.)  Minimization procedure We applied our recently developed optimization protocol for minimizing wild-type and mutant structures (20). Heavy side chain atoms without known coordinates and hydrogen atoms were added to the crystal structures using the VMD (version 1.9.1) program (21) with models immersed into rectangular boxes of water molecules extending up to 10 Ã… from the protein in each direction. Wild-type protein complexes were minimized for 40	000 steps using explicit TIP3P water model. The final minimized models of wild-type protein complexes were used to produce all mutant structures and then an additional 300-step minimization for all mutant structures was performed. The energy minimization was carried out with the NAMD program (version 2.9) (22) using the CHARMM27 force field (23). For unfolding free energy calculations we applied the optimization procedure implemented in the RepairPDB module of the FoldX program (24) which optimizes the side chain configurations to provide a repaired structure. (See Supplementary Materials and Methods for more information.)  Binding and unfolding free energy calculations Binding free energy and effects of mutations on binding affinity were calculated according to the approach introduced by us earlier (20). Energy calculations were based on the modified MM-PBSA method that combined the molecular mechanics terms with the Poissonâ€“Boltzmann continuum representation of the solvent (25) and statistical scoring energy functions with parameters optimized on experimental sets of several thousand mutations (equation 3). Binding free energy calculations were performed on minimized wild-type and mutant structures of inactive CBL-E2-S and active pCBL-E2-S states. The binding energy is defined as a difference between the free energies of the complex and unbound proteins.  Î”Gbind=GCBL-E2-S-GCBL-S-GE2 (1) The change of binding energy due to a mutation can be calculated as:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î”Gbindmut-Î”GbindWT (2) The effect of mutations on binding affinity was calculated in this work using the following energy function:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î±Î”Î”Evdw+Î²Î”Î”Gsolv+Î³Î”SAmut+ÎµÎ”Î”GBM+Î»Î”Î”GFD+Î´ (3) Here Î”Î”Evdw is the change of the van der Waals interaction energy and Î”Î”Gsolv is the change of the polar solvation energy of solute in water. Î”SAmut represents a term proportional to the interface area of the mutant complex. Î”Î”GBM and Î”Î”GFD are the binding energy changes from BeAtMuSiC and FoldX	 respectively. BeAtMuSiC (26) estimates the effect of mutations on binding based on statistical potentials.  The FoldX software program (24) was used to estimate the unfolding free energy and to model the unfolding state. FoldX calculates the effects of mutations on protein stability using an empirical force field. The BuildModel module was used to introduce a mutation	 optimize the configurations of the neighboring side chains and calculate the difference in stability (unfolding free energy) between mutant ( Î”Gfoldmut) and repaired native structure ( Î”GfoldWT).  Î”Î”Gfold=Î”Gfoldmut-Î”GfoldWT (4) For comparison we used three alternative methods to predict the impacts of mutations on unfolding free energy: the Eris server (27)	 the Rosetta program (28) and the PoPMuSiC server (29). We also applied four additional webtools to assess the impacts of amino acid substitutions on CBL function: PROVEAN (30)	 PolyPhen-2 (31)	 MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). (See Supplementary Methods for more information.)  Go to: Experimental procedures Expression constructs  Human CBL cDNA was originally obtained from Wallace Langdon and subsequently cloned into the pCEFL expression plasmid (34). Point mutation constructs	 described above	 were created from wild-type CBL using the QuikChange II Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions (Stratagene	 La Jolla	 CA). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.  Cell culture and transfections  The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T	 the human nonsmall cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the human cervical cancer cell line HeLa used in this study were originally obtained from ATCC and maintained in culture using DMEM (Gibco	 Grand Island	 NY) supplemented with 10% FBS	 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin sulfate. Cell lines were authenticated by Short Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis by using either Promega Powerplex 16 (Promega	 Madison	 WI) or the AmpFISTR Identifier Kit (Life Technologies	 Carlsbad	 CA) and compared to the ATCC or DSMZ databases. HeLa cells were received in the lab in 2013 last authenticated on 7-30-15	 A549 were received in the lab in 2015 and last authenticated on 8-12-15	 and HEK293T were received in the lab in 1995 and last authenticated on 10-8-15.HEK293T cells were transfected using calcium phosphate according to the instructions accompanying the reagent (Profection; Promega Corp.	 Madison	 WI)	 incubated 18 h prior to media change and grown for a total of 48 h prior to harvesting. A549 and Hela cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen	 Carlsbad	 CA). Transfections were allowed to incubate 6 h prior to media change	 and cells were grown an additional 48 h before being harvested. Cells were starved for 4 hours and treated with EGF (100 ng/ul). Each cell-based experiment was repeated at least two times.  Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation  To harvest proteins	 cells were washed twice in ice-cold Dulbeccoâ€™s PBS-containing 200 Î¼M sodium orthovanadate (Fisher Chemicals	 Fairlawn	 NJ) then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5	 150 mM NaCl	 5 mM EDTA	 1% Triton X-100	 10% glycerol	 100 mM iodoacetamide [Sigma-Aldrich Corp.	 St. Louis	 MO]	 2 mM sodium orthovanadate	 and protease inhibitors [Complete tabsÂ®	 Roche Diagnostics Corp.	 Indianapolis	 IN]). All whole cell lysates were cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 16	000 Ã— g for 15 m at 4 Â°C. Supernatant protein concentrations were determined using the BioRad protein assay (BioRad	 Hercules	 CA). For immunoblotting	 20Î¼g of whole cell lysates were boiled in a 1:1 dilution of 2X loading buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8	 10% glycerol	 2% SDS	 1 mg/ml bromophenol blue	 0.3573 M Î²-mercaptoethanol) for 5 m. For immunoprecipitations	 150 Î¼g of each of the whole cell lysates were incubated with rabbit anti-EGFR (Ab-3; Millipore) and with Protein A/G+ agarose beads (sc-2003; Santa Cruz Biotechnology	 Santa Cruz	 CA). All immunoprecipitations were incubated overnight at 4Â°C with tumbling. Immune complexes were washed five times in 1 mL cold lysis buffer	 then resuspended in 2X loading buffer	 boiled for 5 m	 then resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran BA85; Whatman	 Sanford	 MA). For immunoblot detection of proteins	 the following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-EGFR (2232L; Cell Signaling)	 rat monoclonal high affinity anti-HA-peroxidase	 (clone 3F10; Roche)	 rabbit anti-Cbl (sc-C-15; Santa Cruz) and mouse anti-Hsc70 (sc-7298; Santa Cruz). Horseradish peroxidase linked donkey anti-rabbit IgG (NA934V; GE Healthcare	 Piscataway	 NJ)	 or donkey anti-mouse IgG (NA931: GE Healthcare	 Piscataway	 NJ) immunoglobulin was used with SuperSignal (Pierce Biotechnology Inc.	 Rockford	 IL) to visualize protein detection.  Densitometric Analysis  Immunoblots were developed on HyBlot CL Autoradiography Film (Denville Scientific Inc.	 South Plainfield	 NJ) with an X-OMAT automated processor (Eastman Kodak	 Rochester	 NY). Protein expression levels were then recorded using an Epson Perfection V750 PRO scanner (Epson Inc.	 Long Beach	 CA) and densitometric analysis was performed using Adobe Photoshop software version 7.0 (Adobe Systems Inc.	 U.S.A). EGFR ubiquitination signal intensity was determined by optical density in a set area normalized against the EGFR band intensity in parallel immunoblots and expressed as a densitometric ratio of ubiquitination/EGFR levels. The mean densitometric ratio of EGFR ubiquitination	 in the presence of each CBL mutation	 was then assessed relative to wild-type CBL where the ratio was set at 1.0.  Go to: Results Cancer mutations impact CBL stability  We estimated the thermodynamic stability (unfolding free energy) changes	 Î”Î”Gfold	 upon mutation for closed (nCBL) and partially opened (CBL-S) CBL states (Fig. 1). These states did not involve binding to E2. The examination of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for random non-cancer mutations (Fig. 2A) showed that it was very similar to experimental distributions produced by random mutagenesis on a set of different proteins (35	 36). Namely	 the distribution for random non-cancer mutations was asymmetrically centered at positive energy values and there were about 10% of random mutations with highly damaging effects on CBL structures by more than 5 kcal molâˆ’1 (Fig. 2A). Despite the presence of highly damaging random mutations	 recurrent cancer mutations overall produced significantly larger destabilizing effects compared to random (p-value â‰ª 0.01) for both nCBL and CBL-S states (Fig. 2A and S1	 Table S2). This was not the case for single cancer mutations observed in only one patient (Table S2). Overall	 the form of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for recurrent cancer mutations was different from the Î”Î”Gfold distribution of random mutations (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p-value â‰ª 0.01) whereas the distribution for single cancer mutations was indistinguishable from a random mutation distribution. However	 it does not mean that all single cancer mutants can be considered passenger	 as we show later	 this is not the case for some of them.  Figure 2 Figure 2 (A) The distribution of unfolding (Î”Î”Gfold) and binding (Î”Î”Gbind) free energy changes for Single	 Recurrent and Random class mutations on nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states (see SI for other states). Positive and negative values ... The top 25% cancer mutations with the largest damaging effects are presented in Table S3. Many of them occurred in Zn-coordinating sites while many others did not involve Zn-coordination sites. Some of these latter mutations (G415V	 G413R and G415S) introduced large Van der Waals clashes with neighboring residues which could not be accommodated by side chain rearrangements	 whereas other mutations (S376F	 Y371D and L405P) affected disulfide or hydrogen bonds. For example	 L405P located in the middle of an Î±-helix affected the CBL structure by introducing an energetically unfavorable kink in the helix due to its inability to donate an amide hydrogen bond.  Effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding  The outcome of mutations can be assessed by the extent of structural changes they induce. We calculated the local root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between the minimized wild-type and mutant structures around the mutated site. We found that the protein backbone in the vicinity of a mutation of the CBL-E2 complex underwent larger local conformational changes upon recurrent cancer mutations	 especially for mutations occurring in Zn-coordinating site clusters	 compared to random mutations (p-value â‰ª 0.01	 Fig. S2 and S3). In the previous section we analyzed the original closed (nCBL) state and partially opened (CBL-S) state induced by substrate binding. In this section we study the effects of cancer mutations on two other CBL states: an autoinhibitory CBL state bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and phosphorylated active CBL state bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1) (13). Effects of mutations on binding can be in general linked with their structural locations	 therefore we examined the locations of mutations and found that about one third of all cancer mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface (Fig. S4). This preference was found to be statistically significant (p-value â‰ª 0.01) (Fig. S4).  It was previously experimentally shown that binding between CBL and E2 was rather weak with a micromolar dissociation constant (13). Despite the fact that the interface between CBL and E2 in the inactive state is several residues larger than in the active state	 consistent with experiments	 we found somewhat stronger binding between CBL and E2 for the active state of CBL (Table S4). Similarly to the impacts of cancer mutations on stability	 recurrent (but not single) mutations destabilized CBL-E2 binding significantly (Fig. 2B	 S1 and Table S2). Importantly	 cancer mutations reduced the CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state (p-value = 0.002) (Fig. 2B) and the effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding of the active state were noticeably larger compared to random mutations even if we excluded mutations in Zn-coordinating sites (Table S2). This latter observation does not hold true for the autoinhibitory CBL-E2-S conformation.  Next	 all cancer mutations were ranked with respect to their effects on CBL-E2 binding. About half of all highly damaging mutations (top 25% of most damaging mutations	 Table S3) impacted both stability and CBL-E2 binding for all four CBL states. Among them	 several mutations occurred in Zn-coordinating clusters and M400 and L405 sites. Another class of mutations (involving W408 and R420 sites) mostly influenced CBL-E2 binding. For example	 the W408S mutation caused the largest perturbation in CBL-E2 binding of the active state by decreasing binding affinity up to 3.5 kcal molâˆ’1 but having a moderate effect on stability of the nCBL and CBL-S states. It was previously suggested that amino acids in positions W408 and I383 constituted specificity of CBL-E2 binding and corresponded to binding hot spots (10	 12). Mutations in the I383 site are not recorded in the COSMIC database although they have a profound destabilizing effect on CBL-E2 binding for both states (see data for random mutations on the ftp site ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/panch/CBL). Another site affecting binding of CBL (R420) is a highly conserved site in the CBL family	 it strongly interacts with the Q92	 W93 and S94 residues of E2. It was previously experimentally verified that mutations in this site disrupted the CBL activity and could be associated with cytokine-independent growth (37). There are 24 cancer patient samples where mutations of this site (R420Q	 R420L and R420P) are found and they all produce strong destabilizing effects on the active pCBL-E2-S state.  According to the zygosity annotation	 there are 49 heterozygous (â€œHeteroâ€) and 27 homozygous (â€œHomoâ€) mutations (Table S1) and for the rest of cancer mutations their zygocity status is undetermined. Overall	 we found that destabilizing mutations were enriched among homozygous compared to heterozygous mutations for all stages of CBL activation cycle (p-value = 0.021 â€“ 0.035) and were more prevalent in leukemia compared to sarcoma patients (p-value = 0.000 â€“ 0.003) (Fig. 2B	 Table S2). This observation could not be attributed to the prevalence of homozygous mutations in Zn-coordinating clusters since these clusters had almost equal numbers of heterozygous and homozygous mutations. It was reported earlier that many homozygous mutations could be connected to uniparental disomy when germline heterozygosity would lead to neoplasia upon reduction to homozygosity (6	38	 39). If some patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms had germline heterozygous mutations in CBL	 then lost the wild-type CBL allele and duplicated mutant allele	 it would be possible that the damaging mutant allele would be duplicated in a cancer cell with a higher probability. Indeed	 human leukemia samples show the loss of the normal CBL allele.  CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination: comparing experiments with computational models  Next we randomly picked fifteen cancer mutations based on their predicted damaging status	 trying to equally sample highly damaging and benign mutations irrespective to their frequencies in cancer samples	 and experimentally tested the E3 activity of wild-type and mutant CBL proteins (see Methods	 Table 1). As can be seen in Fig. 3A	 in the presence of wild-type CBL	 activation of the EGFR induced more than a 10-fold increase in the ubiquitination of the EGFR compared to empty vector (endogenous CBL levels) in HEK293T cells (compare lane 4 to lane 2 in top panel of Fig. 3A). The E3 activity of wild-type CBL was mirrored by a decrease in the levels of immunoprecipitated EGFR consistent with the targeting of ubiquitinated EGFR for degradation (compare lanes 2 and 4 in second panel of Fig. 3A).  Figure 3 Figure 3 (A) EGFR ubiquitination. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant CBL proteins along with the EGFR and hemagglutinin (HA)-epitope tagged ubiquitin. The vector control and wild-type	 CBL transfectant cells were incubated ... Table 1 Table 1 Experimental relative densitometry values for HEK293T cells	 predicted changes in stability (Î”Î”Gfold kcal molâˆ’1)	 binding affinity (Î”Î”Gbind kcal molâˆ’1) and comparison with other methods for 15 experimentally ... We classified all mutations into three groups (damaging	 attenuating and benign) according to their experimental relative densitometry data and compared experimental data with the estimates produced by the computational models. The first group of damaging mutants included C396R	 H398Q	 Y371H	 K382E and C381A which completely abolished CBL activity (relative densitometry was less than 10%) (Fig. 3B) and the levels of total EGFR were not decreased by these mutants (Fig. 3A). Only two of these mutants belonged to the Recurrent class of mutations. Table 1 shows predicted and experimentally verified effects of mutations on all four CBL states. All five mutants were predicted to be damaging by stability and binding affinity calculations but the mechanisms of their action were different. C396R	 H398Q and C381A mutations disrupted Zn-coordinating clusters and had very damaging consequences according to the stability model for both nCBL and CBL-S states and damaging effects on CBL-E2 binding even though none of these mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface. On the other hand	 the K382E mutation did not affect Zn-coordination but destabilized the nCBL state. This	 in turn	 could be explained by the charge substitution that led to the disruption of the K382-E373 salt bridge within the closed state of nCBL (Figure 4 and Figure S5A). Moreover	 K382E mutation had a significant impact on CBL-E2 binding due to the disruption of a salt bridge between pY371 and K382 affecting the stability of CBL in the active state (Figure 4 and Figure S5D). No significant changes were observed for CBL-S and CBL-E2-S states (Figure S5B	C). K382E mutation was previously observed in Noonan syndrome and was speculated to affect CBL stability or binding (40). Finally	 the Y371H mutation not only abolished phosphorylation at the Y371 site but also had a profound destabilizing effect on all four states as evident from Table 1.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Structures of wild type (green) and K382E mutant (tan) are shown for nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states. Salt bridges are shown as dashed lines and in both cases mutation affects the stability by disrupting the salt bridge. The second group of mutants (M374V	 V430M	 P428L	 Q249E and double mutant S80N/H94Y) maintained the CBL activity equivalent to or greater than wild-type CBL (relative densitometry of 80% or higher) (Fig. 3B). Consistent with this	 the levels of the activated EGFR were also decreased in these samples (Fig. 3A). To confirm that the retained E3 activity of these mutants was not cell type specific	 we transfected these mutants into the non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the cervical cancer cell line Hela (Fig. S6). The S80N/H94Y and Q249E mutations were previously identified in human non-small cell lung cancers making the A549 cell line a relevant cell type to investigate the function of these CBL mutants while other cancer mutations were found in other cancer types. As in the HEK293T cells	 transfection of wild-type CBL into A549 and HeLa cells resulted in a significant increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of EGFR compared to the cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. S6). The increase in transfected CBL protein compared to endogenous CBL protein was less in HeLa than in either the A549 or HEK293T cells. Consistent with this	 the fold increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of the EGFR by wild-type CBL was smaller in Hela cells (about three fold) compared to either A549 or HEK293T cells (more than 10 fold in each). As in HEK293T cells	 the Y371H mutant did not stimulate ubiquitination compared to the vector transfected control for A549 or HeLa cells (Fig. S6A and C). The CBL mutants that were fully active in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3A and B) maintained CBL E3 activity in A549 and HeLa cells (Fig. S6). Two of these CBL mutants resulted in more ubiquitination of EGFR compared to wild type CBL. For example	 the Q249E mutant showed an increased ubiquitination of EGFR in 293T and HeLa cells while the M374V mutant resulted in higher ubiquitination levels in A549 and HeLa cells (Figure 3 and S6). Only V430M mutant was on the borderline with the densitometry ratio of 0.8. All mutations from the second group were predicted to be benign according to our computational models	 whereas V430M	 consistent with experimental data	 had a borderline destabilizing impact on CBL-E2 binding (Table 1).  Finally	 the third group constituted mutations (L399V	 G375P	 P395A and V391I) which attenuated the CBL E3 activity according to the relative densitometry data (Fig. 3B). Only one of these mutants was observed in two cancer samples while other three belonged to the Single mutation class. Concordant with this	 there were intermediate levels of EGFR (Fig. 3A). G375P and P395A mutations were predicted to have partially damaging effects while V391I and L399V were classified as benign in our predictions. Interestingly	 mutations from this third group affected only some of the CBL states. In contrast	 the highly damaging mutations from the first group had damaging impacts on almost all CBL states.  Next we tested if the reduction in CBL ubiquitination activity was directly correlated with the effects of mutations on stability (Fig. 5A). The relationship between experimental densitometry data and Î”Î”Gfold was better described by an exponential dependence with correlation coefficient (R) of 0.77 and 0.78 for CBL-S and nCBL states respectively (Table S5). Indeed	 the change in absorption between wild-type and mutant proteins which refers to a fraction of active mutants can be described by the Boltzmann equation relating the probability of a state with the energy of this state. A mutation may lead to damaging effects and a loss of function if it impacts at least one of the CBL functional states. Taking this into consideration we calculated the correlation between densitometry and stability changes taking a maximum of Î”Î”Gfold values for the nCBL and CBL-S states. As shown in Fig. 5A and Table S5	 changes in stability can indeed explain the effects of mutations on CBL ubiquitination activity with high correlation of R = 0.83. For comparison	 several alternative methods were applied to predict the effect of mutations on unfolding free energy	 they all reported correlation coefficients ranging from 0.21 to 0.52	 with only one method PopMusic reporting a statistically significant correlation of 0.52 (Table S5). The relationship between densitometry and binding affinity changes was on the borderline of significance with a linear correlation coefficient of 0.48 and 0.62 (if two highly damaging mutations were excluded) (Fig. 5B and Table S5).  Figure 5 Figure 5 (A) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (exponential model) and maximal predicted changes in stability. (B) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (linear model) and predicted changes in binding affinity of pCBL-E2-S state. ... There are various methods which predict the phenotypic effects of mutations	 (30â€“33	 41) and some of them use structural features (31	 41). We applied four state-of-the-art independent methods to predict the impacts of mutations on CBL function: PROVEAN (30)	 PolyPhen-2 (31)	 MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). Some of these methods outperformed our model in classifying cancer from random mutations since they were trained to distinguish disease from neutral variants (Table S6). However	 all four methods had a very limited accuracy in classifying CBL cancer mutations into those that disrupted function and those that did not. As evident from Table 1 and Table S5	 all methods except for PROVEAN over-predicted damaging effects of experimentally tested mutations while PROVEAN was the only method which produced a significant correlation between the densitometry data and PROVEANâ€™s score (R=0.58	 Table S5).  Go to: Discussion Stability-activity balance in cancer related proteins  Evolutionary selection to maintain structural	 foldable and functional proteins eliminates many mutations in protein sequences. On the other hand	 thermodynamic stability can be compromised in evolution to ensure certain arrangements of catalytic and binding sites	 which might not be energetically optimal (36	 42). In tumorigenesis	 protein stability or binding may be reduced (or in some cases increased) due to cancer mutations. As a consequence it can lead to decreased fitness at the protein level	 but may confer a fitness advantage for the population of tumor cells (43	 44). However	 the extent of the stability-activity tradeoff in oncogenes and tumor suppressors remains largely unknown. Using the example of the CBL protein	 here we tried to elucidate the stability-activity balance and to understand whether the loss or gain of activity in cancer-related proteins can be accompanied by compromised stability or binding.  In contrast to many other computational studies	 which attempt to link stability with activity by mostly focusing on one protein conformation	 we performed an analysis on four different stages of the CBL activation cycle. Our predictions of changes in stability and binding were further elucidated by the experimental CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays. We found a strong relationship between the effects of mutations on CBL stability and experimentally obtained densitometry data (quantifying activity)	 while a relatively weaker correlation was observed between changes in densitometry and CBL-E2 binding affinity. It could be explained either by a less significant impact of experimentally tested mutations on CBL-E2 binding or by a limited coupling (compared to CBL stability) between CBL-E2 binding and E3 activity.  Drivers or passengers?  According to our study	 about two thirds of all experimentally tested mutations either completely abolished or attenuated E3 activity	 while one third of them were neutral. Trying to assess the limitations of our models	 we applied state-of- the-art methods commonly used to predict functional effects of mutations. However	 these methods failed to distinguish inactivating from neutral mutations as accurately as the computational models which were solely based on accounting for the effects on stability and binding for different CBL states. Indeed	 many methods are not specifically designed to discriminate driver from passenger mutations within the pool of cancer mutations	 but rather they perform a task of distinguishing cancer from neutral mutations.  Certainly	 the large majority of all mutations detected in cancer genomics studies are likely to be neutral although the collective burden of passenger mutations may also alter the course of tumorigenesis (45). When we analyzed the distribution of all single cancer missense mutations observed in the CBL gene	 their average effects on stability or binding were not found to be significantly different from the pool of random mutations. These mutations either mostly constitute true passenger mutations or their oncogenic mechanisms are not directly connected to protein destabilization. The story is quite the opposite for the recurrent mutations as they have on average significantly higher destabilizing effects than random mutations and the majority of them should be drivers. An interesting group of mutations includes those which are highly damaging but found only in one cancer sample (10% of all single cancer mutations). These mutations may represent either rare driver or latent driver mutations (46). Several of these mutations were experimentally tested and are listed in Table 1.  CBL-E2 binding in deciphering the mechanisms of cancer  Our analysis showed that cancer mutations reduce CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state. It is in contrast to the stability-activity tradeoff reported for EGFR and other cancer related proteins (47)	 where cancer mutations may disrupt autoinhibitory interactions and activate the kinase (48	 49). Importantly	 all mutations with experimentally tested high inactivating effects have impacts on both CBL stability and CBL-E2 binding (Table 1). In fact	 the correlation between Î”Î”Gfold and Î”Î”Gbind for CBL cancer mutations from COSMIC is positive (R = 0.20 â€“ 0.48 depending on the CBL state	 p-value < 0.05). It might seem counterintuitive as some residues maintain stability by sustaining the RING-TKBD autoinhibitory interactions within CBL. This interface overlaps with the CBL-E2 interface and competes against E2 binding (13). One might think that disruption of RING-TKBD interactions and destabilization of CBL might facilitate binding to E2 and therefore lead to CBL activation. A slight activation was actually observed for two mutants	 one of which (M374V) was directly located on the CBL-E2 interface. However	 as we showed through the positive high correlation between stability and activity changes	 this mechanism is rarely observed and the vast majority of mutations disrupt CBL-E3 activity by either destabilizing CBL and/or CBL-E2 binding or by directly affecting phosphorylation of the critical tyrosine Y371.  Overall	 our results support the idea that decrease of E3 activity	 of the ability to ubiquitinate receptor tyrosine kinases	 of CBL stability and/or CBL-E2 binding can give a selective advantage for tumor cells. However	 there are several factors that complicate deciphering the mechanisms of action of CBL cancer mutations. CBL mutations can be dominant-negative and mutated CBL might not only change the CBL E3 activity but also might affect the concentration and activity of the wild-type CBL. According to a ratiometric method to identify driver genes in cancer (1)	 CBL can be regarded as an oncogene since it has several mutation hot spots. On the other hand	 as shown in our study and in other studies	 cancer driver mutations can inactivate the E3 activity of CBL	 so it can also be regarded as a tumor suppressor. Although the latter fact complicates the development of CBL targeted therapies	 understanding the delicate balance among different CBL-affected pathways may facilitate the indirect drug targeting of damaged CBL proteins. The current genetics-based frameworks to analyze cancer genome-wide sequence data are necessary but not sufficient for understanding the processes of carcinogenesis and developing informed	 targeted therapies. Our approach	 which can be applied in general to different proteins of interest	 emphasizes the importance of the physics of binding and protein conformational ensembles in deducing the mechanisms of cancer.  																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																
4	9|| Abstract Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is characterized by hypersensitivity to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). SHP2	 NF-1	 KRAS	 and NRAS are mutated in JMML patients	 leading to aberrant regulation of RAS signaling. A subset of JMML patients harbor CBL mutations associated with 11q acquired uniparental disomy. Many of these mutations are in the linker region and the RING finger of CBL	 leading to a loss of E3 ligase activity. We investigated the mechanism by which CBL-Y371H	 a linker region mutant	 and CBL-C384R	 a RING finger mutant	 lead to enhanced GM-CSF signaling. Expression of CBL mutants in the TF-1 cell line resulted in enhanced survival in the absence of GM-CSF. Cells expressing CBL mutations displayed increased phosphorylation of GM-CSF receptor Î²c subunit in response to stimulation	 although expression of total GM-CSFR Î²c was lower. This suggested enhanced kinase activity downstream of GM-CSFR. JAK2 and LYN kinase expression is elevated in CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutant cells	 resulting in enhanced phosphorylation of CBL and S6 in response to GM-CSF stimulation. Incubation with the JAK2 inhibitor	 TG101348	 abolished the increased phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c in cells expressing CBL mutants	 whereas treatment with the SRC kinase inhibitor dasatinib resulted in equalization of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation signal between wild type CBL and CBL mutant samples. Dasatinib treatment inhibited the elevated phosphorylation of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants. Our study indicates that CBL linker and RING finger mutants lead to enhanced GM-CSF signaling due to elevated kinase expression	 which can be blocked using small molecule inhibitors targeting specific downstream pathways.  Keywords: Cytokine	 E3 Ubiquitin Ligase	 JAK Kinase	 Signal Transduction	 SRC	 CBL	 GM-CSF	 Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia Go to: Introduction Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a cytokine that regulates the differentiation	 survival	 proliferation	 and functional activation of granulocytes and monocytes in the myeloid lineage (1). In order to mediate its functional activity	 GM-CSF binds to its receptor	 the GM-CSF receptor (GM-CSFR)	2 consisting of GM-CSR Î± and GM-CSFR Î² common (Î²c) subunits. The Î²c subunit of the receptor is shared by the IL-3 and IL-5 receptors. Î²c is the major signaling subunit and is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to cytokine stimulation. Î²c phosphorylation results in the recruitment of various effectors leading to activation of downstream signaling (2â€“4). GM-CSFR Î± is the major binding subunit	 which dictates the binding specificity of the receptor complex for GM-CSF (2	4	 5). The engagement of GM-CSFR by GM-CSF results in the formation of a dodecameric complex of GM-CSFÂ·GM-CSFR Î±Â·GM-CSFR Î²c	 which leads to the trans-phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c-associated JAK2 kinases (6). The activated JAK2 kinases phosphorylate GM-CSFR Î²c tyrosine residues	 allowing for the recruitment of various effectors and the activation of downstream signaling. GM-CSF stimulation results in the activation of the JAK-STAT	 PI3K	 and the RAS/MAPK pathways	 contributing to GM-CSF-mediated differentiation	 proliferation	 and survival (reviewed in Refs. 1 and 4).  GM-CSF hypersensitivity is one of the defining characteristics of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). This disease is classified by the World Health Organization as a mixed myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease (7). JMML patients must show persistent monocytosis in the absence of the BCR-ABL oncogene (8). Genetic lesions deregulating the RAS signaling pathway have been identified to lead to JMML pathogenesis. 10â€“15% of JMML patients harbor mutations in neurofibromin protein (NF1) (9	 10)	 a GTPase-activating protein	 which negatively regulates RAS by enhancing the hydrolysis of the active GTP-bound conformation of RAS to the inactive GDP-bound form (11). 35% of JMML patients have mutations in SHP2 (12â€“14)	 a protein-tyrosine phosphatase that positively regulates the RAS signaling pathway (15	 16). RAS-activating mutations account for another 20â€“25% of JMML-associated mutations (17â€“19). Several groups determined that a proportion of JMML patients have 11q uniparental disomy. CBL mutations were identified upon further analysis of the 11q uniparental disomy samples (20â€“22). The presence of NF1	 SHP2	 RAS	 and CBL mutations are mutually exclusive	 raising the question of how CBL mutations can lead to disease development.  CBL mutations have been identified in numerous other myeloid malignancies	 including acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic	 myeloproliferative	 and mixed myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease (23â€“28). The majority of these mutations localize to the CBL linker region or the RING finger. CBL is a ubiquitin E3 ligase	 which specifies target proteins for ubiquitination. The linker region and RING finger of CBL play very important roles in its E3 ligase functionality. The linker region contains two conserved tyrosine residues	 Tyr-368 and Tyr-371	 whose phosphorylation activates and positively regulates E3 ligase activity of CBL (29â€“31). The CBL RING finger is responsible for recruiting active E2s carrying an ubiquitin moiety	 allowing for the transfer of ubiquitin to the target substrate (29	 32). Therefore	 it is not surprising that mutations in the linker region and RING finger of CBL identified in myeloid malignancies result in a loss of E3 ligase activity.  JMML is associated with GM-CSF hypersensitivity; however	 there is a lack of evidence that specifically examines the role of CBL downstream of the GM-CSF receptor and how JMML-associated CBL mutations may affect GM-CSF signaling. CBL is known to become phosphorylated downstream of the Î²c in response to stimulation by IL-3 (33	 34) and GM-CSF (35	 36). Furthermore	 CBL associates with the Î²c subunit upon IL-5 stimulation (37). However	 these studies do not directly address the role of CBL in GM-CSF signaling.  The objective of this study is to investigate how JMML-associated CBL mutations modulate GM-CSF signaling and lead to GM-CSF hypersensitivity. We expressed wild type CBL	 CBL-Y371H	 and CBL-C384R in the human TF-1 hematopoietic cell line	 which expresses the endogenous GM-CSF receptor at physiological levels (38). Upon GM-CSF stimulation	 elevated phosphorylation of GM-CSF Î²c was observed	 resulting from elevated JAK2 and LYN phosphorylation. Expression of CBL JMML mutants resulted in enhanced S6 phosphorylation and increased cell survival. Treatment with pharmacologic inhibitors delineated which proximal GM-CSF-dependent pathways are dependent on JAK2 and LYN activation. In summary	 our data show that CBL JMML mutants result in enhanced GM-CSF signaling via modulation of JAK2 and LYN tyrosine kinases.  Go to: EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Constructs pMSCV-HA-CBL retroviral vectors were used to create JMML-associated CBL mutants. HA-tagged CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R were constructed using QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kits (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol.  Retrovirus Production HEK 293T cells were plated onto 10-cm dishes (Sarstedt) and grown to around 75% confluence. The 293T cells were transiently transfected with pSV (Gag and Pol proteins) and pVSV-G (envelope protein) and pMSCV-GFP retroviral vectors expressing HA-wild type CBL	 HA-CBL-Y371H	 or HA-CBL-C384R using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as directed in the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly	 4.5 Î¼g of pSV	 1.5 Î¼g of VSV-G	 and 4.5 Î¼g of pMSCV-IRES-GFP-HA-CBL constructs were mixed with Lipofectamine 2000 in serum- and antibiotic-free DMEM H-21 for 20 min at room temperature. 293T cells were washed with serum-free DMEM H-21	 and 4 ml of serum- and antibiotic-free DMEM H-21 was added to the cells. DNA-Lipofectamine 2000 mixture was added to the plated cells and incubated for 6 h at 37 Â°C. Transfection medium was removed from the cells	 and 10 ml of RPMI 1640 medium with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum was added. Transfected 293T supernatant containing VSV-G pseudotyped virus carrying pMSCV-HA-CBL was collected at 48 and 72 h post-transfection.  Cell Lines and Culture TF-1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium	 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum	 100 units of penicillin/ml	 100 Î¼g of streptomycin/ml	 and 2 ng/ml recombinant human GM-CSF. In order to stably express wild type and mutant CBL	 TF-1 cells were infected with VSV-G pseudotyped retrovirus carrying wild type CBL	 CBL-Y371H	 and CBL-C384R constructs. TF-1 cells were suspended in retroviral supernatant supplemented with 8 ng/ml Polybrene and centrifuged in 50-ml tubes at 12	000 rpm for 75 min. TF-1 cells were resuspended in fresh retroviral Polybrene solution and incubated overnight in 6-well dishes at 37 Â°C. A final round of spinoculation with fresh retroviral supernatant was performed on day 2. TF-1 cells were allowed to expand for 48 h. GFP-positive infected TF-1 cells expressing HA-CBL constructs were purified using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).  XTT Assay TF-1 cells were cytokine-depleted overnight	 as described below. 2000 cells were transferred to each well of a 96-well plate in a final volume of 100 Î¼l of RPMI	 10% FCS with the indicated concentrations of GM-CSF. Plates were incubated at 37 Â°C for 48 h prior to the addition of 3 Î¼m phenazine methosulfate (Sigma) and 2 mg/ml XTT (Diagnostic Chemicals). The cells were incubated with the XTT/phenazine methosulfate solution for 6 h at 37 Â°C. The absorption of the reduction product at 450 nm was measured using a spectrophotometer plate reader.  Annexin V Flow Cytometric Analysis TF-1 cells were cytokine-depleted and maintained in cytokine-free media for 72 h. Cells were stained with annexin V-phycoerythrin (PE) according to the manufacturer's protocol (BD Pharmingen). Stained cells were analyzed using a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur flow cytometer.  Cytokine Deprivation	 Stimulation	 and Lysis TF-1 cells were washed three times in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)	 Hanks' balanced salts; depleted in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum overnight at 37 Â°C; and then stimulated with 0.5 ng/ml recombinant human GM-CSF. Proteasomal and lysosomal degradation was inhibited by incubation of cells with 30 Î¼m MG132 (Calbiochem/Millipore) and 100 Î¼m chloroquine (Sigma)	 respectively	 for 2 h prior to stimulation. JAK2 and LYN kinase activity was inhibited by treatment with 2 m TG101348 (generously provided by Dr. R. Levine) for 4 h or with 0.1 m dasatinib (gift from Dr. D. Hedley) for 2 h	 respectively. TF-1 cells were stimulated with 0.5 ng/ml recombinant human GM-CSF for the indicated times at 37 Â°C.  The cells were washed once in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)	 Hanks' balanced salts containing 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate	 10 mm sodium fluoride	 10 mm EDTA	 and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100	 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)	 150 mm NaCl	 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate	 10 mm sodium fluoride	 10 mm EDTA	 1 mm sodium orthovanadate	 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and supplemented with â€œcOmpleteâ€ protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science). After 5 min on ice	 the lysates were centrifuged at 10	000 Ã— g for 5 min at 4 Â°C.  Antibodies The 4G10 phosphotyrosine-specific monoclonal antibody and anti-ERK1/2 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology/Millipore. Anti-IL-3/IL-5/GM-CSFR Î²c N-20 (used for immunoblotting) and K-17 (used for immunoprecipitations))	 anti-Shp2	 and anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology	 Inc. (Santa Cruz	 CA). Antibodies specific for phospho-JAK2 (Tyr-1007/1008)	 JAK2	 phospho-SRC family (Tyr-416)	 phospho-Ser-235/236 S6	 and Lynp56 were acquired from Cell Signaling Technologies. An anti-phospho STAT5a/b antibodies were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc./Invitrogen. Anti-STAT5 antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences. The monoclonal 12CA5 anti-HA antibody was acquired from Roche Applied Science.  Immunoprecipitations Antibodies along with a 50-Î¼l volume of protein A or protein G-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added to 2 mg of lysates for an overnight incubation at 4 Â°C. The beads were washed three times in ice-cold lysis buffer. The immune complexes were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm DTT. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane for Western blotting.  Western Blotting Following the electrophoretic transfer of proteins to PVDF membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences)	 the membranes were blocked at room temperature with 2.5% BSA (w/v) or 5% nonfat dry milk (w/v) in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 150 mm NaCl) with Tween 20 for 1 h. Membranes were then incubated with an optimal concentration of the primary antibody in Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 Â°C. Membranes were washed four times in TBST and incubated with the relevant HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 30â€“60 min. Membranes were washed four times in TBST and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence with autoradiographic film (ECL	 Amersham Biosciences). For reprobing	 membranes were stripped in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8)	 2% SDS	 and 0.1 m Î²-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 50 Â°C; rinsed twice in TBST; and blocked in 2.5% BSA in Tris-buffered saline prior to primary antibody incubation. Western blots were scanned and quantified using ImageJ software. Quantified Western blots are presented as mean Â± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test.  Go to: RESULTS Enhanced and Prolonged Phosphorylation of the GM-CSFR Î²c in CBL Mutant-expressing Cells GM-CSF hypersensitivity is one of the hallmark features of JMML (39). We utilized the TF-1 hematopoietic cell line to investigate the role of JMML-associated CBL mutations in vitro. TF-1 cells endogenously express the GM-CSF receptor Î± (GM-CSFRÎ±) and the IL-3/IL-5/GM-CSF receptor Î² common chain (GM-CSFR Î²c)	 and are responsive to GM-CSF. HA-tagged wild type CBL	 CBL-Y371H	 and CBL-C384R mutants were stably expressed in TF-1 cells (Fig. 1A). All exogenous constructs showed high expression of CBL when compared with vector-infected cells (Fig. 1A). This is especially advantageous because studies have shown that expression of wild type CBL can rescue or mask the effects of CBL mutants (23	 40).  FIGURE 1. FIGURE 1. Enhanced phosphorylation of GM-CSF receptor Î²c upon expression of CBL mutants. A	 lysates from parental TF-1 cells as well as from TF-1 cells expressing wild type CBL	 CBL-Y371H	 and CBL-C384R were probed for CBL expression. IB	 immunoblot. B ... Binding of GM-CSF to the GM-CSF receptor complex activates JAK2	 leading to the tyrosine phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c. In order to investigate the effects of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants on GM-CSF signaling	 we examined the phosphorylation of the GM-CSFR Î²c after stimulation. TF-1 cells expressing wild type CBL	 CBL-Y371H	 and CBL-C384R were cytokine-depleted and stimulated with GM-CSF. GM-CSFR Î²c was immunoprecipitated from lysates and immunoblotted with the 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Upon GM-CSF stimulation	 cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants (Fig. 1B	 lanes 5 and 6 and lanes 8 and 9) show enhanced phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c compared with the wild type CBL controls (lanes 2 and 3). Furthermore	 prolonged phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c was observed in CBL mutant samples.  CBL plays an important role in stimulation-induced endocytosis	 trafficking	 and degradation of numerous tyrosine kinase (29	 32) and cytokine receptors (41	 42). To determine whether expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants has an effect on the expression of the GM-CSFR Î²c	 as well as its GM-CSF induced degradation	 lysates collected from GM-CSF-stimulated TF-1 cells were probed for GM-CSFR Î²c. Because it is likely that CBL-Y371H (23	 30) and CBL-C384R (43) mutations result in a loss of CBL E3 ligase activity	 GM-CSFR Î²c levels were expected to be higher in mutant CBL-expressing cells. Surprisingly	 expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R (Fig. 2A	 lanes 4â€“9) results in a decrease in GM-CSFR Î²c compared with wild type CBL (lanes 1â€“3)-expressing cells at 0	10	 and 60 min (Fig. 2B). However	 it is important to note that GM-CSFR Î²c expression decreased after GM-CSF stimulation in wild type and mutant CBL-expressing cells at comparable rates. These results indicate that although expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R results in an overall decreased expression of GM-CSFR Î²c	 the degradation of the receptor poststimulation appears not to be disrupted.  FIGURE 2. FIGURE 2. TF-1 cells expressing CBL mutants have lower expression levels of GM-CSFR Î²c. Lysates were collected as described in the legend to Fig. 1. A	 immunoblotting (IB) was performed with GM-CSFR Î²c-specific antibody. Blots were reprobed for ... Elevated Levels of JAK2 Kinase in CBL-Y371H- and CBL-C384R-expressing TF-1 Cells Upon binding of GM-CSF to GM-CSFRÎ±	 a GM-CSFR Î²c homodimer is recruited (6)	 bringing the Î²c-associated JAK2 kinase (44	 45) into close proximity	 allowing transphosphorylation and subsequent activation of the kinase. Activation of JAK2 is essential for downstream GM-CSF signaling (46	 47). The enhanced and prolonged phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c	 along with a decrease in the overall expression of the receptor in CBL mutant-expressing cells may be indicative of elevated kinase activity downstream of GM-CSFR Î²c. Because JAK2 is the main tyrosine kinase downstream of GM-CSFR	 the GM-CSF-induced activation of JAK2 was assessed. TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R displayed elevated levels of phosphorylated JAK2 upon GM-CSF stimulation (Fig. 3A	 top	 lanes 5 and 6 and lanes 8 and 9)	 compared with the wild type CBL controls (lanes 2 and 3). Reprobing for total JAK2	 revealed that the observed enhancement of the phospho-JAK2 signal may be due to an increase in the expression of JAK2 in CBL mutant-expressing cells (Fig. 3	 A (middle	 lanes 4â€“9) and B).  FIGURE 3. FIGURE 3. Expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants results in elevated JAK2. A	 lysates collected from TF-1 cells expressing wild type and CBL mutants were probed for phospho-Tyr-1007/1008 JAK2 and reprobed for total JAK2 and tubulin. B	 blots were quantified ... Linker and RING finger mutations disrupt the E3 ligase activity of CBL (29	31	 32). Such loss of E3 ligase activity has been shown to result in a significant decrease in the EPO-induced ubiquitination of JAK2 (23). In order to determine whether the increase in total JAK2 in CBL mutant expressing cell lines was due to compromised ubiquitination and degradation of the kinase	 TF-1 cells expressing wild type CBL	 CBL-Y371H	 and CBL-C384R were treated with proteasomal (MG-132) and lysosomal (chloroquine) inhibitors prior to stimulation. Inhibition of proteasomal and lysosomal degradation stabilized JAK2 to comparable levels in all three cell lines (Fig. 3C	 middle). These results indicate that the expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants affects the degradation of JAK2	 leading to elevated levels	 which in turn contribute to increased JAK2 phosphorylation and potentially signaling in response to GM-CSF stimulation.  Increased Expression of LYN Kinase in CBL Mutant Cells Although JAK2 is the primary kinase activated downstream of GM-CSF receptor	 members of the SRC family kinase are stimulated in response to GM-CSF (48â€“50). Specifically	 LYN has been shown to directly associate with GM-CSFR Î²c (51) and to play an important role in mediating the anti-apoptotic effects of GM-CSF in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (49	 52). LYN also associates with GM-CSFRÎ± and is involved in the survival signal required for factor-independent growth of cells expressing the FIÎ” GM-CSFR Î²c mutant (48). Considering that TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R show enhanced survival while exhibiting lower expression of GM-CSFR Î²c	 we wanted to determine whether LYN phosphorylation and/or expression was altered in CBL mutant-expressing cells. Lysates collected from GM-CSF-stimulated cells were probed with an antibody specific for pY396-LYN	 residing in a phosphorylated motif within the LYN activation loop. Increased LYN phosphorylation was observed in cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants (Fig. 4A	 top	 lanes 4â€“9)	 compared with those expressing wild type CBL (lanes 1â€“3). Reprobing for total LYN revealed that CBL mutant cells have increased levels of LYN (p56) (Fig. 4	 A (middle	 lanes 4â€“9) and B). This observed increase in LYN expression leads to elevated LYN phosphorylation	 which may contribute to the enhanced survival of CBL mutant TF-1 cells.  FIGURE 4. FIGURE 4. Increased expression of LYN kinase in CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutant TF-1 cells. A	 whole cell lysates collected from TF-1 cells expressing CBL-WT and CBL mutants were immunoblotted with antibodies specific for Tyr(P)-396-LYN. Blots were reprobed for ... Similar to JAK2	 treatment with MG-132 and chloroquine stabilized total LYN levels to comparable levels in wild type and mutant cells	 indicating that the increase in LYN levels is probably due to the loss of E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the CBL mutants (Fig. 4C).  Expression of CBL Mutants Results in Constitutive S6 Phosphorylation and Enhanced Factor-free Survival Investigation of signaling effectors further downstream of the GM-CSF receptor revealed enhanced phosphorylation of SHP2 in CBL mutant-expressing cells relative to wild type CBL controls (Fig. 5A). Constitutive phosphorylation of S6 in TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R	 compared with wild type CBL-expressing controls (Fig. 5B)	 was also observed. No significant differences were observed in the phosphorylation of STAT5 or ERK1/2 (Fig. 5C) between wild type CBL- and mutant CBL-expressing TF-1 cells after GM-CSF stimulation.  FIGURE 5. FIGURE 5. Expression of CBL mutants results in constitutive phosphorylation of S6 and enhanced survival of TF-1 cells. A	 SHP2 immunoprecipitations (IP) were performed on lysates collected from TF-1 cells expressing CBL-WT	 CBL-Y371H	 and CBL-C384R	 which were ... XTT assays were performed to determine whether the expression of the CBL linker and RING finger mutants results in enhanced survival and growth. TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants displayed enhanced survival in the absence of GM-CSF relative to cells expressing wild type CBL (Fig. 5D). The increase in the survival of the mutant-expressing cells decreases with increasing concentration of GM-CSF. Cell counting assays were also performed to confirm these results (data not shown). To determine whether the increase in survival was due to a decrease in apoptosis	 annexin V staining was performed on cytokine-deprived wild type and mutant CBL-expressing cells. There was a decrease in annexin V-positive TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H relative to wild type CBL-expressing controls	 whereas the proportion of annexin V-positive CBL-C384R-expressing cells was comparable with wild type CBL controls (Fig. 5E). These results indicate that JMML-associated CBL mutations result in enhanced survival of TF-1 cells at low doses of GM-CSF.  Constitutive and Enhanced Phosphorylation of CBL Mutants Is Dependent on an SRC Family Kinase CBL is phosphorylated downstream of numerous oncogenic protein-tyrosine kinases (BCR/ABL and v-SRC)	 receptor tyrosine kinases (PDGF-R	 FLT-3	 and c-KIT)	 and cytokine receptors (TPO and EPO) (reviewed in Ref. 53). For example	 CBL is tyrosine-phosphorylated downstream of the Î²c chain in response to IL-3 (33	 34) and GM-CSF (35	 36).  The carboxyl-terminal region of CBL contains three major tyrosine phosphorylation sites	 Tyr-700	 Tyr-731	 and Tyr-774 (54). Phosphorylation of these tyrosines leads to the recruitment of SRC homology 2 domain-containing effectors. Phosphorylated Tyr-700 of CBL binds the guanine nucleotide exchange factor	 VAV (55). Phosphorylated Tyr-731 acts as the binding site for the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K (56	 57)	 and members of the CRK adaptor protein family have been shown to bind both phosphorylated Tyr-700 and Tyr-774 (58â€“60). Downstream pathways mediated by CBL tyrosine phosphorylation sites play an important role in CBL-mediated signaling. Linker region mutations of CBL have been shown to lead to enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL in Ba/F3-FLT3 cells (24).  We were interested in determining whether expression of the linker region Y371H and the RING finger C384R mutations would result in altered CBL tyrosine phosphorylation. CBL was immunoprecipitated from wild type and mutant CBL TF-1 lysates	 and phosphorylation was assessed by Tyr(P) immunoblotting (Fig. 6). CBL-Y371H (lanes 4â€“6) and CBL-C384R (lanes 7â€“9) were highly phosphorylated compared with CBL wild type controls (lanes 1â€“3). Both CBL mutants showed constitutive phosphorylation in the absence of GM-CSF stimulation (lanes 4 and 7).  FIGURE 6. FIGURE 6. Dasatinib treatment abolishes the enhanced phosphorylation of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R. TF-1 cells expressing WT and mutant CBL were incubated with dasatinib and TG101348 for 2 and 4 h	 respectively	 prior to GM-CSF stimulation. Cells were lysed	 and HA ... Although numerous members of the SRC family kinases	 including LYN (61â€“63)	 are capable of phosphorylating CBL	 there is evidence that Janus kinase family members may also target CBL for tyrosine phosphorylation (64). To determine whether inhibition of JAK2 or SRC family kinases could abolish the enhanced and constitutive phosphorylation of CBL	 TF-1 cells expressing wild type and mutant CBL were treated with either the JAK2-specific inhibitor TG101348 or the SRC family kinase inhibitor dasatinib prior to stimulation. The constitutive and enhanced phosphorylation of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants (lanes 22â€“27) persisted in TG101348-treated samples (Fig. 6)	 whereas pretreatment with dasatinib abolished the elevated phosphorylation of CBL mutants (lanes 13â€“18) to levels comparable with wild type CBL controls (lanes 10â€“12). These results indicate that downstream of the GM-CSF receptor	 CBL is phosphorylated by a SRC family kinase	 potentially LYN	 and mutations in the linker region or the RING finger domain of CBL lead to not only enhanced but also constitutive phosphorylation of CBL.  TG101348-mediated Inhibition of Enhanced Phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c in CBL Mutant-expressing Cells We were interested in determining how the inhibition of JAK2 or SRC family kinases downstream of GM-CSFR would modulate the elevated phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c observed in CBL mutant-expressing cells (Figs. 1B and â€‹and7	7	 lanes 1â€“9). TF-1 cells were treated with TG101348 and dasatinib	 alone or in combination	 prior to stimulation and subsequent GM-CSFR Î²c immunoprecipitation. TG101348 treatment resulted in a significant inhibition of GM-CSF-induced phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c in both wild type CBL- and CBL mutant-expressing cells	 resulting in an equally down-modulated level of the phosphorylated receptor (Fig. 7	 lanes 10â€“18). This was expected	 because JAK2 is known to be the kinase responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of the GM-CSFR Î²c in response to stimulation (47	65	 66).  FIGURE 7. FIGURE 7. Inhibition of JAK2 activity via treatment with TG101348 abolishes the enhanced phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î² in CBL mutant-expressing cells. TF-1 cells expressing WT-CBL	 CBL-Y371H	 and CBL-C384R were cytokine-depleted and treated with 2 mm TG101348 ... Interestingly	 inhibition of SRC family kinases did not result in the inhibition of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation	 but it did result in an equivalent level of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation in wild type CBL and CBL mutant samples (Fig. 7	 lanes 19â€“27). Treatment with both TG101348 and dasatinib inhibited GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation (Fig. 7	 lanes 28â€“36) to similar levels observed in samples treated with only TG101348.  Go to: DISCUSSION Hypersensitivity to GM-CSF is one of the defining characteristics of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Until recently	 genes mutated in JMML patients (NF1	 SHP2	 NRAS	 and KRAS) were directly involved in the RAS signaling pathway. The Loh and Maciejewski groups (20â€“22) found that 10â€“15% of JMML patients have mutations in CBL and that these mutations are associated with acquired uniparental disomy. The majority of CBL mutations identified clustered in the linker region and RING finger	 both of which play an important role in the E3 ligase activity of CBL. The identification of these JMML-associated CBL mutations raised a number of questions about the role of CBL downstream of GM-CSF receptor	 whether CBL is involved in RAS signaling downstream of GM-CSFR	 and how mutations in CBL can lead to hypersensitivity to GM-CSF. In order to address these questions	 we utilized the TF-1 hematopoietic cell line	 which is GM-CSF-responsive (38) and has a low endogenous CBL expression. To examine the functional consequences of CBL linker region mutations	 we expressed CBL-Y371H linker and CBL-C384R RING finger mutants	 because these are two of the most common CBL mutations observed in JMML patients (21	 22).  We found that expression of these CBL mutants in GM-CSF-stimulated TF-1 cells leads to enhanced and prolonged phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c	 which occurred concurrently with elevated expression of both JAK2 and LYN. Assessment of downstream signaling revealed enhanced phosphorylation of S6 in CBL-Y371H- and CBL-C384R-expressing cells relative to wild type CBL controls. TF-1 cells expressing CBL mutations showed enhanced survival in the absence of GM-CSF	 and specifically in the case of CBL-Y371H-expressing cells	 this is probably due to a decrease in induction of apoptosis. We also observed elevated and constitutive phosphorylation of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants	 which was inhibited upon treatment with dasatinib	 an SRC family kinase inhibitor. Interestingly	 treatment with dasatinib also led to equalization of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation between wild type CBL- and CBL mutant-expressing cells. However	 inhibition of JAK2 activity by TG101348 resulted in complete inhibition of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation in CBL mutant and wild type CBL control cells.  Expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants results in prolonged and elevated receptor tyrosine phosphorylation	 which supports the observed enhancement in survival (67). Martinez-Moczygemba and Huston (37	 68)	 using the IL-5 receptor as a model for Î²c subunit-sharing cytokine receptors (IL-3/IL-5/GM-CSF)	 demonstrated that increased Î²c subunit ubiquitination is observed after stimulation. This ubiquitination event leads to the proteasomal degradation of the cytoplasmic tail of the Î²c subunit	 which attenuates downstream signaling (37	 68). They also found that the ubiquitination of the Î²c subunit may be mediated by CBL	 because the E3 ligase was co-immunoprecipitated with the Î²c subunit. The loss of E3 ligase activity of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants may prevent GM-CSFR Î²c ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the cytoplasmic region of the receptor and culminate in the observed enhancement of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation and elevated levels of JAK2. However	 this is unlikely	 because we have observed total levels of GM-CSFR Î²c to be lower in CBL mutant cells. Alternatively	 increased JAK2 and LYN expression could be correlated with a negative feedback loop that down-regulates GM-CSFR Î²c levels in TF-1 cells. The ubiquitination of Î²c in response to IL-5 stimulation is dependent on JAK2 activity (68	 69). In CBL-Y371H- and CBL-C384R-expressing cells	 the enhanced JAK2 activity can potentially lead to increased ubiquitination of the Î²c by other ubiquitin ligases	 resulting in decreased overall expression of the receptor subunit.  JAK2 is also regulated via CBL-mediated ubiquitination (23	 70). The expression of CBL mutants Y371H and C384R may result in decreased ubiquitination of JAK2	 culminating in elevated levels of JAK2 as well as enhanced JAK2-mediated phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c. We found that in CBL mutant cells	 there was elevated expression of JAK2 kinase	 which was abolished upon treatment with proteasomal and lysosomal inhibitors.  Similar to JAK2	 several members of the SRC family kinases (71)	 including LYN	 have been shown to be ubiquitinated (72) by CBL (73	 74). The enhanced expression of LYN in TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R indicates that	 downstream of GM-CSFR	 CBL is responsible for LYN ubiquitination. LYN mediates the tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL downstream of Î²1 integrin (61)	 granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) (62	 75)	 and the B-cell antigen receptor (63	 76). We have observed enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants	 which is abolished upon treatment with the SRC family kinase inhibitor dasatinib. This confirms that LYN is a kinase responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL downstream of the GM-CSFR	 and the enhanced phosphorylation of CBL mutants may be a functional consequence of the elevated levels of LYN in CBL mutant-expressing cells.  Phosphorylation of CBL Tyr-731 leads to the activation of the PI3K pathway via recruitment of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K (54	 56). The Corey group (62	 77) has shown that LYN couples to the PI3K pathway in a CBL-dependent manner	 whereby activated LYN binds and phosphorylates CBL	 allowing for the recruitment of p85 to the complex. LYN also activates the PI3K pathway downstream of GM-CSFR Î± (48)	 promoting cell survival. We have shown that expression of CBL JMML mutants defective in E3 ubiquitin ligase activity leads to aberrant regulation of LYN downstream of GM-CSFR	 which ultimately leads to constitutive and enhanced phosphorylation of S6	 suggesting elevated PI3K pathway activity. Interestingly	 basal activation of S6 has been observed in mononuclear cells isolated from JMML patients (78). Furthermore	 in the absence of LYN	 the antiapoptotic effects of GM-CSF are abolished (49	 52). At low concentrations of GM-CSF	 the signaling pathways activated downstream of the receptor lead to cell survival only	 whereas stimulation with higher doses results in cell proliferation and cell survival (79). We have shown that expression of CBL mutants results in enhanced survival	 especially at low doses	 or in the complete absence of GM-CSF in TF-1 cells. These data suggest that CBL linker and RING finger mutants lower the threshold concentration of GM-CSF required to induce cell survival. Together	 these results suggest that in CBL-Y371H- and CBL-C384R-expressing cells	 the modulation of the PI3-K pathway due to the increase in LYN levels may be contributing to the observed enhancement of survival in the absence of GM-CSF.  The mechanism by which these mutations lead to elevated GM-CSF signaling and enhanced survival depends on the role of CBL as both an E3 ligase and an adaptor protein. CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants compromise the E3 ligase activity of CBL. We have shown that these loss-of-function mutations lead to increased levels of JAK2 and LYN kinases downstream of the GM-CSFR	 potentially due to loss of ubiquitination of the kinases or to the inhibition of GM-CSFR Î²c ubiquitination and cytoplasmic domain degradation. These events contribute to the elevated levels of GM-CSF signaling observed in CBL mutant-expressing TF-1 cells. Sanada et al. (23) have shown that Cblâˆ’/âˆ’ LSK cells show a mild cytokine hypersensitivity	 but transformation of Cblâˆ’/âˆ’ LSK cells with Cbl linker region mutants significantly enhances the cytokine hypersensitivity	 indicating a gain-of-function of the mutants that cannot be ascribed to a simple loss of CBL E3 ligase activity. Inhibition of Cbl-b function by mutant Cbl has been proposed as a possible mechanism (80	 81). However	 it is possible that functionality of CBL as an adaptor protein may be contributing to the gain of function of the mutants. Our group	 as well as others	 has shown that expression of CBL linker and RING finger mutants results in enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL (24	81	 82). This increase in CBL phosphorylation culminates in enhanced PI3K and RAS pathway activation. We found that treatment with dasatinib results in loss of CBL phosphorylation. Interestingly	 dasatinib treatment equalized GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation in wild type- and CBL mutant-expressing TF-1 cells. Therefore	 dasatinib treatment may decouple the gain-of-function capacity of CBL mutants from the loss of E3 ligase activity. Considering that treatment with JAK2 inhibitor	 TG101348	 results in complete inhibition of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation	 dasatinib may provide a treatment option for the enhanced signaling driven by CBL gain-of-function mutations.  Prior studies have shown that expression of CBL linker region and RING finger mutants inhibits stimulation-induced ubiquitination of the EGF-R (23	 29)	 FLT3	 c-KIT	 and JAK2 (downstream of EPO-R) (23). Niemeyer et al. (40) have shown that expression of CBL linker region mutants in Ba/F3-EPO-R cells results in an enhanced phosphorylation of ERK1/2	 AKT	 and S6. In Ba/F3 cells expressing the FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase	 expression of CBL-Y371 mutants leads to elevated FLT3 phosphorylation as well as AKT and STAT5 (24). Although these studies are useful to probe how CBL mutations perturb FLT3 signaling in AML	 no studies have examined the role of CBL JMML mutations in GM-CSF-dependent signaling pathways to date. Our analysis reveals that expression of CBL-Y371H or CBL-C384R in TF-1 cells generates GM-CSF hypersensitivity that affects proximal steps in receptor activation	 including GM-CSFR Î²c	 JAK2	 and LYN coupling to PI3K activation. Unlike with the Ba/F3 results	 we failed to observe effects on ERK1/2 or STAT5 activation. Whether this is a function of the unique receptor systems or distinct cell lines remains to be determined.  In conclusion	 these studies have confirmed that CBL plays a negative regulatory role downstream of GM-CSFR. We have shown that the enhancement of GM-CSF signaling observed upon loss of CBL E3 ligase activity is due to increased stability of JAK2 and LYN. These results provide in vitro support for further investigation into the applicability of JAK2 and SRC family kinase inhibitors for use in treatment of myeloid malignancies associated with CBL linker region and RING finger mutations. 																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											
4	10||Oncogenic mutations in the monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) gene have been found in many tumors	 but their significance remains largely unknown. Several human c-Cbl (CBL) structures have recently been solved depicting the protein at different stages of its activation cycle and thus provide mechanistic insight underlying how stability-activity tradeoffs in cancer-related proteins may influence disease onset and progression. In this study	 we computationally modeled the effects of missense cancer mutations on structures representing four stages of the CBL activation cycle to identify driver mutations that affect CBL stability	 binding	 and activity. We found that recurrent	 homozygous	 and leukemia-specific mutations had greater destabilizing effects on CBL states than did random non-cancer mutations. We further tested the ability of these computational models assessing the changes in CBL stability and its binding to ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2	 by performing blind CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays in cells. Experimental CBL ubiquitin ligase activity was in agreement with the predicted changes in CBL stability and	 to a lesser extent	 with CBL-E2 binding affinity. Two-thirds of all experimentally tested mutations affected the ubiquitin ligase activity by either destabilizing CBL or disrupting CBL-E2 binding	 whereas about one-third of tested mutations were found to be neutral. Collectively	 our findings demonstrate that computational methods incorporating multiple protein conformations and stability and binding affinity evaluations can successfully predict the functional consequences of cancer mutations on protein activity	 and provide a proof of concept for mutations in CBL.  Keywords: CBL	 driver mutations	 protein interactions Go to: Introduction Whole exome sequencing of cancer patients has produced unprecedented amounts of data to analyze and interpret; these studies report a very large fraction of missense mutations which can potentially be implicated in tumorigenensis (1). Although some missense mutations can provide selective growth advantage to tumor cells (driver mutations)	 the large majority of them are considered to be neutral (passenger mutations). The mechanisms by which the driver variants may affect protein stability	 interactions	 and function remain largely unknown. Various computational methods have been developed to estimate the impacts of disease mutations on proteins but most of them exclusively use sequence features and do not explicitly utilize the protein three-dimensional structures	 their physico-chemical properties and dynamics (2	 3). Many cancers are characterized by (de)activation of certain proteins which may be a result of missense mutations (4). The interconversion between active and inactive states is highly regulated in proteins and it is not well understood how these regulatory mechanisms are disrupted in cancer. The development of in silico approaches to estimate the effects of disease mutations on protein activity	 stability and binding will help to define which are likely to be driver or passenger mutations. Moreover	 understanding the mechanisms of their actions would allow for prioritization of potential driver candidates for better targeted therapies to design drugs which might in turn compensate for the reduced/enhanced protein stability or activity.  The monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) RING finger ubiquitin ligase (E3) represents an exceptionally difficult yet important system to study the mechanisms of cancer mutations (5	 6). Strikingly	 proteins from this family play both positive and negative regulatory roles in tyrosine kinase signaling which is aberrantly activated in many cancers (5). Oncogenic mutations in the c-Cbl gene (referred to as CBL thereafter) were found in human myeloid neoplasms and other tumors (5) but the significance of these mutations and their impacts on CBL function were studied only for very few mutants (7). The mechanistic aspects of CBL cancer mutations can now be adequately addressed as several CBL structures have become available which represent the snapshots of different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1). All CBL proteins share a highly conserved N-terminus which includes a tyrosine kinaseâ€“binding domain (TKBD)	 a linker helix region (LHR) and a RING finger domain	 while the C-terminus comprises a proline-rich region (8). The RING domain of CBL has E3 activity and ubiquitinates activated receptor tyrosine kinases which subsequently targets them for degradation (8). At the same time	 since CBL proteins can bind to activated receptor tyrosine kinases via the TKBD domain	 they can serve as adaptors by recruiting downstream signal transduction components such as SHP2 and P13K (9	 10).  Figure 1 Figure 1 CBL activation cycle. The structures representing the activation cycle of CBL are shown. In the inactive closed state (nCBL) the protein exists in the cytosol. Upon activation of the RTK	 CBL can bind to the phosphorylated RTK (orange peptide) via TKBD ... Another aspect of CBL function which should be accounted for in modeling the effects of cancer mutations is that it can bind to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) in complex with ubiquitin (Ub) and a substrate protein	 thereby facilitating the transfer of Ub from E2 to a lysine residue of the substrate (11). The crystal structure of the inactive complex of CBL with E2 (UbcH7) was solved more than ten years ago (12) while the active phosphorylated CBL-E2 (UbcH5B) complex was resolved fairly recently (13). According to the latter study	 substrate binding and Tyr371 phosphorylation activates CBL by producing a large conformational change in order to place the RING domain and E2 in close proximity to the substrate. It was further confirmed that phosphorylation-induced conformational change is required for positioning of ubiquitin for effective catalysis (14).  Here we present a new approach	 which aims to assess the effects of cancer mutations on stability	 binding and activity of cancer related proteins. We apply computational models to four different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1) and perform blind in vivo experiments of CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination. We show a rather remarkable agreement of experimental EGFR ubiquitination by CBL mutants with the computed changes in CBL thermodynamic stability and to a lesser extent with CBL-E2 binding affinity. The computational models not only quantitatively predict the magnitude of the effects of mutations but also shed light on the mechanisms of their action. Namely	 we find that cancer mutations have greater destabilizing effects on four CBL states than random non-cancer mutations for recurrent	 homozygous and leukemia mutations. Most damaging cancer mutations happen in the sites involved in Zn-coordination and in the formation of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds within CBL or between CBL and E2. Overall cancer driver mutations affect different or multiple stages of the CBL activation cycle either completely abolishing its E3 activity or partially attenuating it. The computational models based on stability and binding affinity calculations can discriminate experimentally validated driver from passenger mutations (with the exception of two mutations) and outperform several state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods aiming to predict phenotypic impacts of mutations.

We extracted 103 missense mutations for the CBL gene from the COSMIC database (15) that could be mapped to four available CBL structures in its activation cycle (Fig. 1). Cancer mutations were classified into different classes according to the frequency of observed samples (single and recurrent mutations)	 zygosity (homo- and heterozygous mutations)	 types of cancer (leukemia and sarcoma) and the involvement of mutations in Zn-coordination (Table S1). In addition	 all possible single nucleotide substitutions resulting in amino-acid changes in the CBL gene were performed to obtain a â€œRandomâ€ missense mutation reference set. After excluding mutations observed in COSMIC and mutations occurring on residues without known coordinates in crystal structures	 we obtained 2	102 random missense mutations (Table S1). We also searched the dbSNP database (16) but found very few benign variations in the CBL gene. Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.  Model preparation We investigated the effects of mutations on four states of the CBL activation cycle: (1) closed CBL state (nCBL)	 (2) partially opened CBL state bound to substrate (CBL-S)	 (3) unphosphorylated autoinhibitory CBL bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and (4) phosphorylated CBL bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1). It was previously noted that both UbcH5B and UbcH7 can bind specifically to CBL but only UbcH5B can facilitate ubiquitination (17). The crystal structures of nCBL (PDB id: 2Y1M) (13)	 CBL-S (PDB id: 2Y1N) (13) and pCBL-E2-S (PDB id: 4A4C) (13) were obtained directly from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (18). Only one crystal structure of the unphosphorylated inactive state of CBL bound to E2 (UbcH7) and Zap-70 peptide (PDB id: 1FBV) (12) was available in PDB. Although sequence identity between UbcH7 and UbcH5B proteins is 38%	 the structural similarity is very high with the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.04 Ã…. The unphosphorylated autoinhibitory structure of CBL-UbcH5B-S was therefore modeled based on CBL-UbcH7-S (PDB id: 1FBV) using Chimera (19). (Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.)  Minimization procedure We applied our recently developed optimization protocol for minimizing wild-type and mutant structures (20). Heavy side chain atoms without known coordinates and hydrogen atoms were added to the crystal structures using the VMD (version 1.9.1) program (21) with models immersed into rectangular boxes of water molecules extending up to 10 Ã… from the protein in each direction. Wild-type protein complexes were minimized for 40	000 steps using explicit TIP3P water model. The final minimized models of wild-type protein complexes were used to produce all mutant structures and then an additional 300-step minimization for all mutant structures was performed. The energy minimization was carried out with the NAMD program (version 2.9) (22) using the CHARMM27 force field (23). For unfolding free energy calculations we applied the optimization procedure implemented in the RepairPDB module of the FoldX program (24) which optimizes the side chain configurations to provide a repaired structure. (See Supplementary Materials and Methods for more information.)  Binding and unfolding free energy calculations Binding free energy and effects of mutations on binding affinity were calculated according to the approach introduced by us earlier (20). Energy calculations were based on the modified MM-PBSA method that combined the molecular mechanics terms with the Poissonâ€“Boltzmann continuum representation of the solvent (25) and statistical scoring energy functions with parameters optimized on experimental sets of several thousand mutations (equation 3). Binding free energy calculations were performed on minimized wild-type and mutant structures of inactive CBL-E2-S and active pCBL-E2-S states. The binding energy is defined as a difference between the free energies of the complex and unbound proteins.  Î”Gbind=GCBL-E2-S-GCBL-S-GE2 (1) The change of binding energy due to a mutation can be calculated as:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î”Gbindmut-Î”GbindWT (2) The effect of mutations on binding affinity was calculated in this work using the following energy function:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î±Î”Î”Evdw+Î²Î”Î”Gsolv+Î³Î”SAmut+ÎµÎ”Î”GBM+Î»Î”Î”GFD+Î´ (3) Here Î”Î”Evdw is the change of the van der Waals interaction energy and Î”Î”Gsolv is the change of the polar solvation energy of solute in water. Î”SAmut represents a term proportional to the interface area of the mutant complex. Î”Î”GBM and Î”Î”GFD are the binding energy changes from BeAtMuSiC and FoldX	 respectively. BeAtMuSiC (26) estimates the effect of mutations on binding based on statistical potentials.  The FoldX software program (24) was used to estimate the unfolding free energy and to model the unfolding state. FoldX calculates the effects of mutations on protein stability using an empirical force field. The BuildModel module was used to introduce a mutation	 optimize the configurations of the neighboring side chains and calculate the difference in stability (unfolding free energy) between mutant ( Î”Gfoldmut) and repaired native structure ( Î”GfoldWT).  Î”Î”Gfold=Î”Gfoldmut-Î”GfoldWT (4) For comparison we used three alternative methods to predict the impacts of mutations on unfolding free energy: the Eris server (27)	 the Rosetta program (28) and the PoPMuSiC server (29). We also applied four additional webtools to assess the impacts of amino acid substitutions on CBL function: PROVEAN (30)	 PolyPhen-2 (31)	 MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). (See Supplementary Methods for more information.)  Go to: Experimental procedures Expression constructs  Human CBL cDNA was originally obtained from Wallace Langdon and subsequently cloned into the pCEFL expression plasmid (34). Point mutation constructs	 described above	 were created from wild-type CBL using the QuikChange II Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions (Stratagene	 La Jolla	 CA). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.  Cell culture and transfections  The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T	 the human nonsmall cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the human cervical cancer cell line HeLa used in this study were originally obtained from ATCC and maintained in culture using DMEM (Gibco	 Grand Island	 NY) supplemented with 10% FBS	 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin sulfate. Cell lines were authenticated by Short Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis by using either Promega Powerplex 16 (Promega	 Madison	 WI) or the AmpFISTR Identifier Kit (Life Technologies	 Carlsbad	 CA) and compared to the ATCC or DSMZ databases. HeLa cells were received in the lab in 2013 last authenticated on 7-30-15	 A549 were received in the lab in 2015 and last authenticated on 8-12-15	 and HEK293T were received in the lab in 1995 and last authenticated on 10-8-15.HEK293T cells were transfected using calcium phosphate according to the instructions accompanying the reagent (Profection; Promega Corp.	 Madison	 WI)	 incubated 18 h prior to media change and grown for a total of 48 h prior to harvesting. A549 and Hela cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen	 Carlsbad	 CA). Transfections were allowed to incubate 6 h prior to media change	 and cells were grown an additional 48 h before being harvested. Cells were starved for 4 hours and treated with EGF (100 ng/ul). Each cell-based experiment was repeated at least two times.  Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation  To harvest proteins	 cells were washed twice in ice-cold Dulbeccoâ€™s PBS-containing 200 Î¼M sodium orthovanadate (Fisher Chemicals	 Fairlawn	 NJ) then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5	 150 mM NaCl	 5 mM EDTA	 1% Triton X-100	 10% glycerol	 100 mM iodoacetamide [Sigma-Aldrich Corp.	 St. Louis	 MO]	 2 mM sodium orthovanadate	 and protease inhibitors [Complete tabsÂ®	 Roche Diagnostics Corp.	 Indianapolis	 IN]). All whole cell lysates were cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 16	000 Ã— g for 15 m at 4 Â°C. Supernatant protein concentrations were determined using the BioRad protein assay (BioRad	 Hercules	 CA). For immunoblotting	 20Î¼g of whole cell lysates were boiled in a 1:1 dilution of 2X loading buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8	 10% glycerol	 2% SDS	 1 mg/ml bromophenol blue	 0.3573 M Î²-mercaptoethanol) for 5 m. For immunoprecipitations	 150 Î¼g of each of the whole cell lysates were incubated with rabbit anti-EGFR (Ab-3; Millipore) and with Protein A/G+ agarose beads (sc-2003; Santa Cruz Biotechnology	 Santa Cruz	 CA). All immunoprecipitations were incubated overnight at 4Â°C with tumbling. Immune complexes were washed five times in 1 mL cold lysis buffer	 then resuspended in 2X loading buffer	 boiled for 5 m	 then resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran BA85; Whatman	 Sanford	 MA). For immunoblot detection of proteins	 the following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-EGFR (2232L; Cell Signaling)	 rat monoclonal high affinity anti-HA-peroxidase	 (clone 3F10; Roche)	 rabbit anti-Cbl (sc-C-15; Santa Cruz) and mouse anti-Hsc70 (sc-7298; Santa Cruz). Horseradish peroxidase linked donkey anti-rabbit IgG (NA934V; GE Healthcare	 Piscataway	 NJ)	 or donkey anti-mouse IgG (NA931: GE Healthcare	 Piscataway	 NJ) immunoglobulin was used with SuperSignal (Pierce Biotechnology Inc.	 Rockford	 IL) to visualize protein detection.  Densitometric Analysis  Immunoblots were developed on HyBlot CL Autoradiography Film (Denville Scientific Inc.	 South Plainfield	 NJ) with an X-OMAT automated processor (Eastman Kodak	 Rochester	 NY). Protein expression levels were then recorded using an Epson Perfection V750 PRO scanner (Epson Inc.	 Long Beach	 CA) and densitometric analysis was performed using Adobe Photoshop software version 7.0 (Adobe Systems Inc.	 U.S.A). EGFR ubiquitination signal intensity was determined by optical density in a set area normalized against the EGFR band intensity in parallel immunoblots and expressed as a densitometric ratio of ubiquitination/EGFR levels. The mean densitometric ratio of EGFR ubiquitination	 in the presence of each CBL mutation	 was then assessed relative to wild-type CBL where the ratio was set at 1.0.  Go to: Results Cancer mutations impact CBL stability  We estimated the thermodynamic stability (unfolding free energy) changes	 Î”Î”Gfold	 upon mutation for closed (nCBL) and partially opened (CBL-S) CBL states (Fig. 1). These states did not involve binding to E2. The examination of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for random non-cancer mutations (Fig. 2A) showed that it was very similar to experimental distributions produced by random mutagenesis on a set of different proteins (35	 36). Namely	 the distribution for random non-cancer mutations was asymmetrically centered at positive energy values and there were about 10% of random mutations with highly damaging effects on CBL structures by more than 5 kcal molâˆ’1 (Fig. 2A). Despite the presence of highly damaging random mutations	 recurrent cancer mutations overall produced significantly larger destabilizing effects compared to random (p-value â‰ª 0.01) for both nCBL and CBL-S states (Fig. 2A and S1	 Table S2). This was not the case for single cancer mutations observed in only one patient (Table S2). Overall	 the form of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for recurrent cancer mutations was different from the Î”Î”Gfold distribution of random mutations (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p-value â‰ª 0.01) whereas the distribution for single cancer mutations was indistinguishable from a random mutation distribution. However	 it does not mean that all single cancer mutants can be considered passenger	 as we show later	 this is not the case for some of them.  Figure 2 Figure 2 (A) The distribution of unfolding (Î”Î”Gfold) and binding (Î”Î”Gbind) free energy changes for Single	 Recurrent and Random class mutations on nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states (see SI for other states). Positive and negative values ... The top 25% cancer mutations with the largest damaging effects are presented in Table S3. Many of them occurred in Zn-coordinating sites while many others did not involve Zn-coordination sites. Some of these latter mutations (G415V	 G413R and G415S) introduced large Van der Waals clashes with neighboring residues which could not be accommodated by side chain rearrangements	 whereas other mutations (S376F	 Y371D and L405P) affected disulfide or hydrogen bonds. For example	 L405P located in the middle of an Î±-helix affected the CBL structure by introducing an energetically unfavorable kink in the helix due to its inability to donate an amide hydrogen bond.  Effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding  The outcome of mutations can be assessed by the extent of structural changes they induce. We calculated the local root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between the minimized wild-type and mutant structures around the mutated site. We found that the protein backbone in the vicinity of a mutation of the CBL-E2 complex underwent larger local conformational changes upon recurrent cancer mutations	 especially for mutations occurring in Zn-coordinating site clusters	 compared to random mutations (p-value â‰ª 0.01	 Fig. S2 and S3). In the previous section we analyzed the original closed (nCBL) state and partially opened (CBL-S) state induced by substrate binding. In this section we study the effects of cancer mutations on two other CBL states: an autoinhibitory CBL state bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and phosphorylated active CBL state bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1) (13). Effects of mutations on binding can be in general linked with their structural locations	 therefore we examined the locations of mutations and found that about one third of all cancer mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface (Fig. S4). This preference was found to be statistically significant (p-value â‰ª 0.01) (Fig. S4).  It was previously experimentally shown that binding between CBL and E2 was rather weak with a micromolar dissociation constant (13). Despite the fact that the interface between CBL and E2 in the inactive state is several residues larger than in the active state	 consistent with experiments	 we found somewhat stronger binding between CBL and E2 for the active state of CBL (Table S4). Similarly to the impacts of cancer mutations on stability	 recurrent (but not single) mutations destabilized CBL-E2 binding significantly (Fig. 2B	 S1 and Table S2). Importantly	 cancer mutations reduced the CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state (p-value = 0.002) (Fig. 2B) and the effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding of the active state were noticeably larger compared to random mutations even if we excluded mutations in Zn-coordinating sites (Table S2). This latter observation does not hold true for the autoinhibitory CBL-E2-S conformation.  Next	 all cancer mutations were ranked with respect to their effects on CBL-E2 binding. About half of all highly damaging mutations (top 25% of most damaging mutations	 Table S3) impacted both stability and CBL-E2 binding for all four CBL states. Among them	 several mutations occurred in Zn-coordinating clusters and M400 and L405 sites. Another class of mutations (involving W408 and R420 sites) mostly influenced CBL-E2 binding. For example	 the W408S mutation caused the largest perturbation in CBL-E2 binding of the active state by decreasing binding affinity up to 3.5 kcal molâˆ’1 but having a moderate effect on stability of the nCBL and CBL-S states. It was previously suggested that amino acids in positions W408 and I383 constituted specificity of CBL-E2 binding and corresponded to binding hot spots (10	 12). Mutations in the I383 site are not recorded in the COSMIC database although they have a profound destabilizing effect on CBL-E2 binding for both states (see data for random mutations on the ftp site ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/panch/CBL). Another site affecting binding of CBL (R420) is a highly conserved site in the CBL family	 it strongly interacts with the Q92	 W93 and S94 residues of E2. It was previously experimentally verified that mutations in this site disrupted the CBL activity and could be associated with cytokine-independent growth (37). There are 24 cancer patient samples where mutations of this site (R420Q	 R420L and R420P) are found and they all produce strong destabilizing effects on the active pCBL-E2-S state.  According to the zygosity annotation	 there are 49 heterozygous (â€œHeteroâ€) and 27 homozygous (â€œHomoâ€) mutations (Table S1) and for the rest of cancer mutations their zygocity status is undetermined. Overall	 we found that destabilizing mutations were enriched among homozygous compared to heterozygous mutations for all stages of CBL activation cycle (p-value = 0.021 â€“ 0.035) and were more prevalent in leukemia compared to sarcoma patients (p-value = 0.000 â€“ 0.003) (Fig. 2B	 Table S2). This observation could not be attributed to the prevalence of homozygous mutations in Zn-coordinating clusters since these clusters had almost equal numbers of heterozygous and homozygous mutations. It was reported earlier that many homozygous mutations could be connected to uniparental disomy when germline heterozygosity would lead to neoplasia upon reduction to homozygosity (6	38	 39). If some patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms had germline heterozygous mutations in CBL	 then lost the wild-type CBL allele and duplicated mutant allele	 it would be possible that the damaging mutant allele would be duplicated in a cancer cell with a higher probability. Indeed	 human leukemia samples show the loss of the normal CBL allele.  CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination: comparing experiments with computational models  Next we randomly picked fifteen cancer mutations based on their predicted damaging status	 trying to equally sample highly damaging and benign mutations irrespective to their frequencies in cancer samples	 and experimentally tested the E3 activity of wild-type and mutant CBL proteins (see Methods	 Table 1). As can be seen in Fig. 3A	 in the presence of wild-type CBL	 activation of the EGFR induced more than a 10-fold increase in the ubiquitination of the EGFR compared to empty vector (endogenous CBL levels) in HEK293T cells (compare lane 4 to lane 2 in top panel of Fig. 3A). The E3 activity of wild-type CBL was mirrored by a decrease in the levels of immunoprecipitated EGFR consistent with the targeting of ubiquitinated EGFR for degradation (compare lanes 2 and 4 in second panel of Fig. 3A).  Figure 3 Figure 3 (A) EGFR ubiquitination. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant CBL proteins along with the EGFR and hemagglutinin (HA)-epitope tagged ubiquitin. The vector control and wild-type	 CBL transfectant cells were incubated ... Table 1 Table 1 Experimental relative densitometry values for HEK293T cells	 predicted changes in stability (Î”Î”Gfold kcal molâˆ’1)	 binding affinity (Î”Î”Gbind kcal molâˆ’1) and comparison with other methods for 15 experimentally ... We classified all mutations into three groups (damaging	 attenuating and benign) according to their experimental relative densitometry data and compared experimental data with the estimates produced by the computational models. The first group of damaging mutants included C396R	 H398Q	 Y371H	 K382E and C381A which completely abolished CBL activity (relative densitometry was less than 10%) (Fig. 3B) and the levels of total EGFR were not decreased by these mutants (Fig. 3A). Only two of these mutants belonged to the Recurrent class of mutations. Table 1 shows predicted and experimentally verified effects of mutations on all four CBL states. All five mutants were predicted to be damaging by stability and binding affinity calculations but the mechanisms of their action were different. C396R	 H398Q and C381A mutations disrupted Zn-coordinating clusters and had very damaging consequences according to the stability model for both nCBL and CBL-S states and damaging effects on CBL-E2 binding even though none of these mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface. On the other hand	 the K382E mutation did not affect Zn-coordination but destabilized the nCBL state. This	 in turn	 could be explained by the charge substitution that led to the disruption of the K382-E373 salt bridge within the closed state of nCBL (Figure 4 and Figure S5A). Moreover	 K382E mutation had a significant impact on CBL-E2 binding due to the disruption of a salt bridge between pY371 and K382 affecting the stability of CBL in the active state (Figure 4 and Figure S5D). No significant changes were observed for CBL-S and CBL-E2-S states (Figure S5B	C). K382E mutation was previously observed in Noonan syndrome and was speculated to affect CBL stability or binding (40). Finally	 the Y371H mutation not only abolished phosphorylation at the Y371 site but also had a profound destabilizing effect on all four states as evident from Table 1.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Structures of wild type (green) and K382E mutant (tan) are shown for nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states. Salt bridges are shown as dashed lines and in both cases mutation affects the stability by disrupting the salt bridge. The second group of mutants (M374V	 V430M	 P428L	 Q249E and double mutant S80N/H94Y) maintained the CBL activity equivalent to or greater than wild-type CBL (relative densitometry of 80% or higher) (Fig. 3B). Consistent with this	 the levels of the activated EGFR were also decreased in these samples (Fig. 3A). To confirm that the retained E3 activity of these mutants was not cell type specific	 we transfected these mutants into the non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the cervical cancer cell line Hela (Fig. S6). The S80N/H94Y and Q249E mutations were previously identified in human non-small cell lung cancers making the A549 cell line a relevant cell type to investigate the function of these CBL mutants while other cancer mutations were found in other cancer types. As in the HEK293T cells	 transfection of wild-type CBL into A549 and HeLa cells resulted in a significant increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of EGFR compared to the cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. S6). The increase in transfected CBL protein compared to endogenous CBL protein was less in HeLa than in either the A549 or HEK293T cells. Consistent with this	 the fold increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of the EGFR by wild-type CBL was smaller in Hela cells (about three fold) compared to either A549 or HEK293T cells (more than 10 fold in each). As in HEK293T cells	 the Y371H mutant did not stimulate ubiquitination compared to the vector transfected control for A549 or HeLa cells (Fig. S6A and C). The CBL mutants that were fully active in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3A and B) maintained CBL E3 activity in A549 and HeLa cells (Fig. S6). Two of these CBL mutants resulted in more ubiquitination of EGFR compared to wild type CBL. For example	 the Q249E mutant showed an increased ubiquitination of EGFR in 293T and HeLa cells while the M374V mutant resulted in higher ubiquitination levels in A549 and HeLa cells (Figure 3 and S6). Only V430M mutant was on the borderline with the densitometry ratio of 0.8. All mutations from the second group were predicted to be benign according to our computational models	 whereas V430M	 consistent with experimental data	 had a borderline destabilizing impact on CBL-E2 binding (Table 1).  Finally	 the third group constituted mutations (L399V	 G375P	 P395A and V391I) which attenuated the CBL E3 activity according to the relative densitometry data (Fig. 3B). Only one of these mutants was observed in two cancer samples while other three belonged to the Single mutation class. Concordant with this	 there were intermediate levels of EGFR (Fig. 3A). G375P and P395A mutations were predicted to have partially damaging effects while V391I and L399V were classified as benign in our predictions. Interestingly	 mutations from this third group affected only some of the CBL states. In contrast	 the highly damaging mutations from the first group had damaging impacts on almost all CBL states.  Next we tested if the reduction in CBL ubiquitination activity was directly correlated with the effects of mutations on stability (Fig. 5A). The relationship between experimental densitometry data and Î”Î”Gfold was better described by an exponential dependence with correlation coefficient (R) of 0.77 and 0.78 for CBL-S and nCBL states respectively (Table S5). Indeed	 the change in absorption between wild-type and mutant proteins which refers to a fraction of active mutants can be described by the Boltzmann equation relating the probability of a state with the energy of this state. A mutation may lead to damaging effects and a loss of function if it impacts at least one of the CBL functional states. Taking this into consideration we calculated the correlation between densitometry and stability changes taking a maximum of Î”Î”Gfold values for the nCBL and CBL-S states. As shown in Fig. 5A and Table S5	 changes in stability can indeed explain the effects of mutations on CBL ubiquitination activity with high correlation of R = 0.83. For comparison	 several alternative methods were applied to predict the effect of mutations on unfolding free energy	 they all reported correlation coefficients ranging from 0.21 to 0.52	 with only one method PopMusic reporting a statistically significant correlation of 0.52 (Table S5). The relationship between densitometry and binding affinity changes was on the borderline of significance with a linear correlation coefficient of 0.48 and 0.62 (if two highly damaging mutations were excluded) (Fig. 5B and Table S5).  Figure 5 Figure 5 (A) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (exponential model) and maximal predicted changes in stability. (B) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (linear model) and predicted changes in binding affinity of pCBL-E2-S state. ... There are various methods which predict the phenotypic effects of mutations	 (30â€“33	 41) and some of them use structural features (31	 41). We applied four state-of-the-art independent methods to predict the impacts of mutations on CBL function: PROVEAN (30)	 PolyPhen-2 (31)	 MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). Some of these methods outperformed our model in classifying cancer from random mutations since they were trained to distinguish disease from neutral variants (Table S6). However	 all four methods had a very limited accuracy in classifying CBL cancer mutations into those that disrupted function and those that did not. As evident from Table 1 and Table S5	 all methods except for PROVEAN over-predicted damaging effects of experimentally tested mutations while PROVEAN was the only method which produced a significant correlation between the densitometry data and PROVEANâ€™s score (R=0.58	 Table S5).  Go to: Discussion Stability-activity balance in cancer related proteins  Evolutionary selection to maintain structural	 foldable and functional proteins eliminates many mutations in protein sequences. On the other hand	 thermodynamic stability can be compromised in evolution to ensure certain arrangements of catalytic and binding sites	 which might not be energetically optimal (36	 42). In tumorigenesis	 protein stability or binding may be reduced (or in some cases increased) due to cancer mutations. As a consequence it can lead to decreased fitness at the protein level	 but may confer a fitness advantage for the population of tumor cells (43	 44). However	 the extent of the stability-activity tradeoff in oncogenes and tumor suppressors remains largely unknown. Using the example of the CBL protein	 here we tried to elucidate the stability-activity balance and to understand whether the loss or gain of activity in cancer-related proteins can be accompanied by compromised stability or binding.  In contrast to many other computational studies	 which attempt to link stability with activity by mostly focusing on one protein conformation	 we performed an analysis on four different stages of the CBL activation cycle. Our predictions of changes in stability and binding were further elucidated by the experimental CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays. We found a strong relationship between the effects of mutations on CBL stability and experimentally obtained densitometry data (quantifying activity)	 while a relatively weaker correlation was observed between changes in densitometry and CBL-E2 binding affinity. It could be explained either by a less significant impact of experimentally tested mutations on CBL-E2 binding or by a limited coupling (compared to CBL stability) between CBL-E2 binding and E3 activity.  Drivers or passengers?  According to our study	 about two thirds of all experimentally tested mutations either completely abolished or attenuated E3 activity	 while one third of them were neutral. Trying to assess the limitations of our models	 we applied state-of- the-art methods commonly used to predict functional effects of mutations. However	 these methods failed to distinguish inactivating from neutral mutations as accurately as the computational models which were solely based on accounting for the effects on stability and binding for different CBL states. Indeed	 many methods are not specifically designed to discriminate driver from passenger mutations within the pool of cancer mutations	 but rather they perform a task of distinguishing cancer from neutral mutations.  Certainly	 the large majority of all mutations detected in cancer genomics studies are likely to be neutral although the collective burden of passenger mutations may also alter the course of tumorigenesis (45). When we analyzed the distribution of all single cancer missense mutations observed in the CBL gene	 their average effects on stability or binding were not found to be significantly different from the pool of random mutations. These mutations either mostly constitute true passenger mutations or their oncogenic mechanisms are not directly connected to protein destabilization. The story is quite the opposite for the recurrent mutations as they have on average significantly higher destabilizing effects than random mutations and the majority of them should be drivers. An interesting group of mutations includes those which are highly damaging but found only in one cancer sample (10% of all single cancer mutations). These mutations may represent either rare driver or latent driver mutations (46). Several of these mutations were experimentally tested and are listed in Table 1.  CBL-E2 binding in deciphering the mechanisms of cancer  Our analysis showed that cancer mutations reduce CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state. It is in contrast to the stability-activity tradeoff reported for EGFR and other cancer related proteins (47)	 where cancer mutations may disrupt autoinhibitory interactions and activate the kinase (48	 49). Importantly	 all mutations with experimentally tested high inactivating effects have impacts on both CBL stability and CBL-E2 binding (Table 1). In fact	 the correlation between Î”Î”Gfold and Î”Î”Gbind for CBL cancer mutations from COSMIC is positive (R = 0.20 â€“ 0.48 depending on the CBL state	 p-value < 0.05). It might seem counterintuitive as some residues maintain stability by sustaining the RING-TKBD autoinhibitory interactions within CBL. This interface overlaps with the CBL-E2 interface and competes against E2 binding (13). One might think that disruption of RING-TKBD interactions and destabilization of CBL might facilitate binding to E2 and therefore lead to CBL activation. A slight activation was actually observed for two mutants	 one of which (M374V) was directly located on the CBL-E2 interface. However	 as we showed through the positive high correlation between stability and activity changes	 this mechanism is rarely observed and the vast majority of mutations disrupt CBL-E3 activity by either destabilizing CBL and/or CBL-E2 binding or by directly affecting phosphorylation of the critical tyrosine Y371.  Overall	 our results support the idea that decrease of E3 activity	 of the ability to ubiquitinate receptor tyrosine kinases	 of CBL stability and/or CBL-E2 binding can give a selective advantage for tumor cells. However	 there are several factors that complicate deciphering the mechanisms of action of CBL cancer mutations. CBL mutations can be dominant-negative and mutated CBL might not only change the CBL E3 activity but also might affect the concentration and activity of the wild-type CBL. According to a ratiometric method to identify driver genes in cancer (1)	 CBL can be regarded as an oncogene since it has several mutation hot spots. On the other hand	 as shown in our study and in other studies	 cancer driver mutations can inactivate the E3 activity of CBL	 so it can also be regarded as a tumor suppressor. Although the latter fact complicates the development of CBL targeted therapies	 understanding the delicate balance among different CBL-affected pathways may facilitate the indirect drug targeting of damaged CBL proteins. The current genetics-based frameworks to analyze cancer genome-wide sequence data are necessary but not sufficient for understanding the processes of carcinogenesis and developing informed	 targeted therapies. Our approach	 which can be applied in general to different proteins of interest	 emphasizes the importance of the physics of binding and protein conformational ensembles in deducing the mechanisms of cancer.  																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			
4	11||Noonan syndrome is an autosomal dominant congenital disorder that encompasses effects on multiple organ systems	 including distinctive facial features	 heart defects	 a short stature	 learning difficulties	 a predisposition to malignancies	 and other clinical manifestations [Roberts et al.	 2013]. It belongs to a group of genetic syndromes	 the RASopathies or RAS pathway disorders	 which are caused by mutations in genes that encode proteins involved in RAS-MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathways [Zenker	 2011]. Germline mutations in PTPN11	 SOS1	 KRAS	 NRAS	 RAF1	 BRAF	 MAP2K1	 or RIT1 underlie Noonan syndrome [Aoki et al.	 2013; Roberts et al.	 2013]. Disease-causing mutations usually enhance signal flow through RAS-MAPK cascades [Schubbert et al.	 2007]. Moreover	 mutations in two genes	 SHOC2 and CBL (MIM# 165360)	 have been reported in patients with Noonan-like phenotypes and additional untypical features [Cordeddu et al.	 2009; Martinelli et al.	 2010; Niemeyer et al.	 2010; Perez et al.	 2010]. Besides	 somatic CBL mutations have been found in various myeloproliferative disorders [Caligiuri et al.	 2007; Sargin et al.	 2007; Loh et al.	 2009; Makishima et al.	 2009; Muramatsu et al.	 2010].  CBL (also known as c-Cbl) is a multifunctional adaptor protein with ubiquitin ligase (E3) activity	 thereby catalyzing ubiquitylation of substrate proteins [Schmidt and Dikic	 2005]. CBL function has been implicated in ligand-mediated internalization and postendocytic sorting of various cell-surface proteins such as the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) [Piper and Lehner	 2011]	 which is a major cellular access to the RAS-MAPK signaling highway. In the present model	 CBL is recruited to the activated EGFR directly by interaction with the receptor at a phosphotyrosine residue [Levkowitz et al.	 1999] and indirectly through the adaptor protein Grb2 [Waterman et al.	 2002; Jiang et al.	 2003]. E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes are then recruited to the RING domain of CBL to promote receptor ubiquitylation; subsequently	 ubiquitin-binding proteins (e.g.	 Epsin) and other endocytic proteins (e.g.	 AP-2) attach and mediate EGFR internalization [Sorkin and Goh	 2009]. After trafficking into endosomes	 EGFR can either be recycled back to the plasma membrane or transported into lysosomes for degradation	 and ubiquitylation of EGFR is a prerequisite for degradative receptor sorting	 a process also called receptor downregulation [Sorkin and Goh	 2009]. Cells use EGFR internalization and sorting into a functional degradative pathway in order to attenuate the magnitude and duration of signaling events [Sorkin and Goh	 2009]. Thus	 CBL negatively regulates EGFR-RAS-MAPK signal traffic downstream of EGFR by controlling receptor internalization and degradation.  For the presented report	 our main objectives were to determine the functional consequences of pathogenic CBL mutations affecting evolutionary conserved amino acids on EGFR ubiquitylation and trafficking and to relate these data to RAS-MAPK pathway dysregulation in Noonan syndrome and other RASopathies. Materials and Methods  Plasmids  We used a human wild-type CBL construct (RefSeq: NM_005188.3) as a template and CBL-specific PCR primers to generate a wild-type CBL cDNA amplicon by PCR. Mutant CBL constructs were established by PCR-mediated mutagenesis. Purified PCR amplicons (CBLWT	 CBLC381A	 CBLK382E	 CBLD390Y	 and CBLR420Q) were cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO (Life Technologies	 Darmstadt	 Germany) according to the protocol provided. Constructs were sequenced for integrity and used for the transfer into GATEWAYâ„¢-compatible destination vector pcDNA3-DEST	 following the manufacturer's instructions. Wild-type CBL construct was a gift from Mirko Schmidt (Goethe University School of Medicine	 Frankfurt am Main	 Germany). Wild-type pcDNA3-EGFR construct (RefSeq: NM_005228.3) was a gift of Dr. Sarah J. Parsons (University of Virginia	 Charlottesville	 VA). pRK5-HA-ubiquitin (RefSeq: NM_021009.5) was purchased from Addgene (plasmid 17608). Cell culture and transfection  COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS; PAA Laboratories	 CÃ¶lbe	 Germany) and penicillin-streptomycin (100 U/ml and 100 Î¼g/ml	 respectively; Life Technologies) and incubated at 37Â°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with pcDNA3-DEST-CBL constructs using Lipofectamineâ„¢2000 Reagent (Life Technologies) or TurboFectâ„¢ (Thermo Scientific	 Bonn	 Germany) according to manufacturer's protocols. Immunoblotting  After transfection with expression constructs	 cells were incubated under serum-starved (0.1% FBS) conditions overnight. Next morning	 cells were stimulated with 10 or 20 ng/ml EGF (Sigmaâ€“Aldrich	 Taufkirchen	 Germany) for different times or left untreated. Cells were washed with ice-cold 1Ã— PBS and harvested in modified RIPA (radioimmunoprecipitation assay) buffer (150 mM NaCl	 50 mM Trisâ€“HCl	 pH 8.0	 0.5% sodium desoxycholate [w/v]	 1% Nonidet P40 [v/v]	 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate [w/v]) containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche	 Mannheim	 Germany) and	 if applicable	 phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche) or N-ethylmaleimide (Sigmaâ€“Aldrich). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 21	000 g for 10 min at 4Â°C and protein solutions were supplemented with sample buffer. Proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF (polyvinylidene difluoride) membranes. Following blocking (20 mM Trisâ€“HCl	 pH 7.4; 150 mM NaCl; 0.1% Tween-20; 4% nonfat dry milk) and washing (20 mM Trisâ€“HCl	 pH 7.4; 150 mM NaCl; 0.1% Tween-20) membranes were incubated in primary antibody solution (20 mM Trisâ€“HCl	 pH 7.4; 150 mM NaCl; 0.1% Tween-20; 5% BSA or 0.5% nonfat dry milk) containing the appropriate antibodies. Next	 membranes were washed and incubated with peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody. After final washing	 immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Millipore	 Schwalbach	 Germany). Antibodies and reagents  Following primary antibodies and dilutions were used: rabbit anti-Cbl (C-15	 WB 1:1	000; IF 1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology	 Heidelberg	 Germany); rabbit anti-EGFR (clone 1005	 WB 1:300; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); rat anti-HA-HRP (WB 1:12	000; Roche); rabbit anti-p44/42 MAP kinase (ERK 1/2	 approved protein symbols MAPK3 and MAPK1) antibody (WB 1:1	000; Cell Signaling Technology	 Danvers	 MA)	 rabbit anti-phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase (pERK 1/2) (Thr202/Tyr204) antibody (WB 1:1	000; Cell Signaling Technology)	 mouse anti-Î±-tubulin antibody (clone DM 1A; WB 1:7	500; Sigmaâ€“Aldrich). As secondary antibodies	 horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (1:5	000â€“1:30	000 dilution; GE Healthcare	 Munich	 Germany) were used. Further reagents used are as follows: Cycloheximide (10 Î¼g/ml; Sigmaâ€“Aldrich)	 N-ethylmaleimide (10 mM; Sigmaâ€“Aldrich)	 EGF complexed with Alexa Fluor 488 (100 ng/ml; Life Technologies)	 and unlabelled human EGF (10 ng/ml or 20 ng/ml; Sigmaâ€“Aldrich). High EGF concentrations were chosen because only higher concentrations of EGF (>10 ng/ml) induce nonclathrin-mediated endocytosis (NCE) in addition to clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) [Sigismund et al.	 2008; Sigismund et al.	 2013]. Notably	 EGFR ubiquitylation seems to be indispensable for NCE [Sigismund et al.	 2013]	 but not for CME [Madshus and Stang	 2009; Sorkin and Goh	 2009; Haglund and Dikic	 2012; Sigismund et al.	 2012]. Biotinylation-based EGFR cell surface assay  COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with CBL expression constructs and incubated under serum-starved (0.1% FBS) culture conditions overnight. Next day	 cells were stimulated with starvation medium supplemented with 10 ng/ml EGF for 30 min or left untreated. Subsequently	 cells were transferred on ice and washed three times with ice-cold HBSS (Life Technologies). Next	 cell surface proteins were biotinylated using 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-SS biotin (Thermo Scientific Pierce	 Bonn	 Germany) in HBSS for 15 min at 4Â°C. Unbound biotin was removed by washing twice with ice-cold HBSS containing 5 mM Trisâ€“HCl (pH 7.4) followed by rinsing with PBS. Subsequent to biotinylation	 cells were harvested in ice-cold RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Aliquots of the total cell lysates were kept for immunoblotting and the remaining supernatants were subjected to precipitation with streptavidin agarose (Sigmaâ€“Aldrich) overnight at 4Â°C. Biotin-labeled surface EGFR fractions coupled to agarose beads were collected by centrifugation for 1 min at 8	000 g at 4Â°C	 and agarose pellets were washed twice with ice-cold RIPA buffer. Precipitates and total cell lysates were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels	 transferred to PVDF membranes	 and subjected to immunodetection. Biotinylation-based EGFR internalization assay  COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with CBL expression constructs and incubated under serum-starved (0.1% FBS) culture conditions overnight. Cells were transferred to ice	 rinsed three times with ice-cold HBSS	 and cell surface proteins were biotinylated using 0.5 mg/ml biotin (Thermo Scientific Pierce) in HBSS for 15 min at 4Â°C. Unbound biotin was quenched by washing three times with 5 mM Trisâ€“HCl (pH 7.4) in HBSS. Internalization of biotinylated EGF receptors was induced by stimulation with 10 ng/ml EGF in prewarmed starvation medium (0.1% FBS) for 30 min at 37Â°C. To stop endocytosis and remove remaining cell surface-bound biotin	 cells were transferred on ice and immediately covered and washed with ice-cold glutathione-containing buffer (50 mM glutathione	 1 mM EDTA	 75 mM NaCl	 10% FBS [v/v]	 75 mM NaOH). After washing with ice-cold PBS	 cells were lysed in RIPA buffer; as controls and to demonstrate the efficiency of biotin-stripping	 unstimulated cultures were lysed in RIPA buffer. Biotinylated proteins were precipitated using streptavidin-conjugated agarose beads; intracellular EGFR fractions were collected in the precipitates. After washing precipitates with RIPA buffer	 both total cell lysates and precipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting. EGFR degradation assay  COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with CBL expression constructs and incubated under serum-starved (0.1% FBS) culture conditions overnight. Next day	 cells were incubated with 10 Î¼g/ml cycloheximide in starvation medium for 30 min to block protein synthesis. Then	 parallel cultures were stimulated by incubation in starvation medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml EGF for 60	120	 or 240 min at 37Â°C. As controls	 parallel cultures were harvested without EGF stimulation. Cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and lysed with ice-cold RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl	 1% Nonidet P40 [v/v]	 0.5% sodium deoxycholate [w/v]	 0.1% SDS [w/v]	 50 mM Tris	 pH 8). Finally	 lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Immunocytochemistry  COS-7 cells were cultivated on coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine and transiently transfected with CBL expression constructs. To visualize EGFR localization	 cells were serum-starved overnight and stimulated with 100 ng/ml fluorescently labeled EGF in starvation medium (0.1% FBS) for 30 min. Subsequently	 cells were rinsed with PBS	 fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigmaâ€“Aldrich) in PBS	 and washed three times with PBS. After treatment with permeabilization/blocking solution (2% BSA	 3% goat serum	 0.5% Nonidet P40 in PBS)	 cells were incubated in antibody solution (3% goat serum and 0.1% Nonidet P40 in PBS) containing rabbit anti-Cbl (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) primary antibody. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor Dyes; Life Technologies) in antibody solution. After extensive washing with PBS	 cells were embedded in mounting solution (25% Mowiol 4â€“88 in PBS mixed with 5% propyl gallate in PBS/glycerol in a ratio of 4:1) on microscopic slides. Cells were examined with a Leica DMIRE2 confocal microscope equipped with an HCX PL APO 63Ã—/1.32 oil immersion objective lens. Quantification of EGF488 signals was performed using Image J software. EGFR ubiquitylation assay  COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with CBL expression constructs together with HA-tagged ubiquitin and EGFR expression constructs. Transfected cells were incubated under serum-starved (0.1% FBS) culture conditions overnight. Next day	 cells were stimulated with starvation medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml EGF for 30 min at 37Â°C. Cells were washed with ice-cold 1Ã— PBS and harvested in ice-cold RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail and 10 mM N-ethylmaleimide (Sigmaâ€“Aldrich) to inhibit deubiquitylating enzymes. Next	 the cell debris was removed by centrifugation and aliquots of the total cell lysates were kept for immunoblotting. The remaining supernatants were incubated with 1 Î¼g of anti-EGFR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 hr at 4Â°C	 followed by incubation with protein A-agarose beads (Roche) overnight at 4Â°C. EGFR coupled to agarose beads were collected by centrifugation for 30 sec at 12	000g at 4Â°C	 and agarose pellets were washed three times with ice-cold Triton lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100 [v/v]	 150 mM NaCl	 5 mM EDTA	 50 mM HEPES	 pH 7.5) supplemented with 0.05% (w/v) SDS. Precipitates and total cell lysates were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels	 transferred to PVDF membranes	 and subjected to immunodetection. Scanning densitometry and statistical analysis  Signals on microscopic images and on autoradiographs were quantified by densitometric analysis using the ImageJ software (NIH; http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/index.html). Relative EGF488 and EGFR levels were assessed as described in the figure legends. One-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were used to compare means of all conditions (CBL protein variants) for statistical significance. Means were considered significant different at P value <0.05. Subsequently	 post hoc two-tailed unpaired Student's t-tests were used to determine statistical significance of the difference of the mean values between two conditions each (i.e.	 CBLWT versus CBLC381A	 CBLK382E	 CBLD390Y	 or CBLR420Q). Values are presented as the mean Â± SD and were considered significant different at P value <0.05. Results  CBL missense mutations in patients with Noonan syndrome-like phenotypes affect amino acids within the linker-RING finger domain [Martinelli et al.	 2010; Niemeyer et al.	 2010; Perez et al.	 2010] (Fig. 1A). Since an intact RING finger domain is essential for both ligand-mediated internalization and degradation of the EGFR [Sorkin and Goh	 2009]	 we analyzed functional consequences of three disease-associated CBL amino acid changes within this domain (Fig. 1A).  Figure 1.  Figure 1. Open in figure viewerDownload Powerpoint slide Modular architecture of CBL and consequences of CBL mutants on EGFR surface levels. A: CBL protein domains and motifs. The total number of amino acids (aa) is given. Tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain (aa 47â€“345)	 linker sequence (linker	 aa 346â€“380)	 RING finger domain (RING	 aa 381â€“423)	 proline-rich region (ProR	 aa 481â€“688)	 and ubiquitin-associated domain (UBA	 aa 857â€“894) are schematically shown. Amino acid substitutions analyzed in this study are indicated. B: p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q amino acid changes compromise CBL function during removal of surface EGFR. COS-7 cells transiently expressing the indicated CBL protein variants or transfected with empty vector (mock) were cultured under serum-starved conditions overnight. Next day	 cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml EGF for 30 min (30 min tEGF) at 37Â°C or left untreated (0 min tEGF). Subsequently	 surface proteins were biotinylated at 4Â°C and precipitated from cell extracts by using streptavidin-conjugated agarose beads. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-EGFR antibodies. Representative autoradiographs show EGFR levels in total cell lysates (tcl) and precipitates (pcpt). Expression of CBL protein variants in total cell lysates was monitored by immunoblotting using anti-CBL antibodies and anti-tubulin antibodies were used to control for equal loading. C: Densities of autoradiographic signals obtained from experiments as described in (B) were quantified by scanning densitometry. Amounts of surface EGFR (i.e.	 precipitated EGFR) was normalized to total EGFR and considered as 100% for unstimulated parallel cultures (0 min tEGF). Thus	 surface EGFR upon EGF stimulation (30 min tEGF) is expressed as percentage of surface EGFR in unstimulated cells. Data represent the mean of n independent experiments Â± SD. One-way ANOVA between groups: P > 0.05 (not significant). Post hoc testing was not performed. CBL amino acid changes p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q alter cellular EGFR distribution  If CBL mutations interfere with EGFR internalization	 the amount of surface and intracellular EGFR should be altered in cells expressing mutant CBL proteins. Therefore	 we determined the level of surface and intracellular EGFR in cells stimulated with EGF for 30 min by using surface biotinylation-based assays. Expression of CBLWT resulted in a clear reduction of surface EGFR upon EGF stimulation (Fig. 1B	 CBLWT	 precipitates	 30 min) relative to unstimulated cells (Fig. 1B	 CBLWT	 precipitates	 0 min). In contrast	 transfection of cells with CBL mutants (Fig. 1B; CBLK382E	 CBLD390Y	 or CBLR420Q) or with empty vector (Fig. 1B	 mock) did not induce marked alterations of surface EGFR levels (Fig. 1B	 compare precipitates for 0 and 30 min each). In line with this	 CBLC381A	 a RING finger mutant (Fig. 1A) that has already been shown to perturb EGFR internalization [Waterman et al.	 1999; Thien et al.	 2001] and that we used as an internal control	 also did not stimulate removal of surface EGFR (Fig. 1B). Densitometric measurements and statistical analysis revealed that only 55.6% of initial EGFR (unstimulated cells) remained at the surface of cells ectopically expressing CBLWT; however	 cells expressing mutant CBL variants or mock-transfected cells displayed between 73.8% and 88.1% of initial EGFR at the cell surface after 30-min EGF treatment (Fig. 1C). Thus	 CBLWT may promote EGF-induced EGFR internalization	 whereas mutations associated with Noonan syndrome-like phenotypes (p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q) as well as the established RING finger mutation p.C381A may compromise this CBL effect. Even though differences of mean values did not reach statistical significance in these experiments by using one-way ANOVA (data not shown)	 a tendency for impaired removal of surface EGFR caused by CBL mutations is obvious. Indeed	 we could substantiate our results by the determination of the amounts of intracellular EGFR after ligand stimulation. CBLWT overexpression resulted in a marked enrichment of the intracellular EGFR fraction upon 30-min EGF treatment (Fig. 2A	 blots on the left-hand side	 precipitates	 30 min) indicating efficient ligand-induced EGFR internalization. Cells expressing any of the tested CBL mutants (CBLK382E	 CBLD390Y	 CBLR420Q	 or CBLC381A) showed slightly decreased levels of intracellular EGFR relative to CBLWT-expressing cells (Fig. 2A	 autoradiographs on the left-hand side	 precipitates	 30 min). Mock-transfected cells also showed reduced amounts of internalized EGFR compared to CBLWT-expressing cells (Fig. 2A	 autoradiographs on the right-hand side	 precipitates; [note: all bands on these autoradiographs represent results after 30-min EGF stimulation]). On the other hand	 CBL mutants seemed to have even less intracellular EGFR upon 30-min EGF stimulation than mock-transfected cells (Fig. 2A	 autoradiographs on the right-hand side	 precipitates). By densitometric measurements and statistical analysis of several independent experiments	 we could prove that expression of mutant CBL variants resulted in significantly decreased ligand-induced internalization of EGFR compared to CBLWT-expressing cells by about 25%â€“33% (Fig. 2B). These data suggest loss-of-function consequences of disease-associated CBL amino acid changes. Interestingly	 mock transfection led to intermediate amounts of intracellular EGFR	 minus 15% compared to CBLWT but about plus 15% compared to CBL mutants (Fig. 2B)	 which may indicate that CBL mutations exert additional dominant-negative effects on EGFR internalization. To confirm our observations by microscopic analysis	 we stimulated COS-7 cells with fluorescently labeled EGF (EGF488) for 30 min (Fig. 3). For these analyses	 we used anti-CBL antibodies	 which recognize ectopically expressed as well as endogenous CBL protein; thus	 untransfected cells and cells expressing very low levels of CBL protein variants cannot be differentiated and both are considered as control cells. Strong expression of CBLWT resulted in increased intracellular EGF488 compared to control cells on the same specimen (Fig. 3A). In contrast	 cells strongly expressing CBLK382E	 CBLD390Y	 CBLR420Q	 or CBLC381A showed reduced amounts of intracellular EGF488 when compared to control cells on the respective same specimen (Fig. 3A). We validated these observations by quantification	 normalization	 and statistical evaluation of immuncytochemical specimens: although expression of CBLWT strongly increased intracellular EGF488 levels	 expression of any CBL mutant decreased the amount of intracellular EGF488 (Fig. 3B). Taken together	 our data demonstrate that CBL amino acid changes p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q alter the cellular distribution of EGFR and we suggest that impaired EGFR internalization underlies this defect.

A: COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with CBL expression constructs or with empty vector (mock) as indicated and cultured under serum-starved conditions overnight. Next day	 surface proteins were biotinylated at 4Â°C and	 subsequently	 stimulated with 10 ng/ml EGF for 30 min (30 min tEGF) at 37Â°C or left untreated (0 min tEGF). Cells were transferred on ice	 remaining cell surface bound biotin was removed	 and cells were harvested. Internalized biotinylated proteins were precipitated with streptavidin-conjugated agarose and samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. To represent each CBL protein variant at least once	 autoradiographs from two different experiments are shown. To demonstrate the efficiency of biotin stripping	 the autoradiographs on the left-hand side also show the levels of precipitated EGFR in unstimulated (0 min tEGF) cells. EGFR levels in total cell lysates (tcl) and precipitates (pcpt) were determined using anti-EGFR antibodies	 expression of CBL protein variants in total cell lysates was monitored by using anti-CBL antibodies	 and anti-tubulin antibodies were used to control for equal loading. B: Autoradiographic signals obtained from experiments as described in (A) were quantified by scanning densitometry. Amount of intracellular EGFR (i.e.	 precipitated EGFR) was normalized to total EGFR and considered as 100% for CBLWT-expressing cells at 30 min tEGF. Thus	 internalized EGFR upon 30-min EGF stimulation is expressed as percentage of internalized EGFR in CBLWT-expressing cells. Data represent the mean of n independent experiments Â± SD. One-way ANOVA between groups: P < 0.05. Post hoc P values were calculated by unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001. Figure 3.  Figure 3.

CBL amino acid changes p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q impair CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitylation and abrogate the stimulating effect of CBL on EGFR degradation  The CBL RING finger domain is central to the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity [Zheng et al.	 2000]	 and CBL-mediated ubiquitylation strongly affects the postendocytic EGFR fate by lysosomal targeting and subsequent degradation of ubiquitylated receptors [Swaminathan and Tsygankov	 2006; Sorkin and Goh	 2009]. First	 we monitored the capacity of wild-type and mutant CBL proteins to ubiquitylate EGFR upon 30-min EGF stimulation by using precipitation-based ubiquitylation assays. Overexpression of CBLWT resulted in a strong ubiquitylation signal in EGFR precipitates (Fig. 4A	 top panel; CBLWT) relative to mock-transfected cells (Fig. 4A	 top panel; mock). In contrast	 transfection of cells with CBL mutants associated with Noonan-like phenotypes did not result in augmented EGFR ubiquitylation (Fig. 4A	 top panel; CBLK382E	 CBLD390Y	 or CBLR420Q). Similarly	 cells expressing ubiquitylation-deficient CBLC381A [Waterman et al.	 1999; Thien et al.	 2001] showed slightly lower levels of ubiquitylated EGFR than CBLWT cells (Fig. 4A	 top panel; CBLC381A and CBLWT). Perfectly in line with the function of ubiquitin-labeling as a trigger for degradation [Swaminathan and Tsygankov	 2006; Sorkin and Goh	 2009]	 the total amount of EGFR in cells expressing CBLWT was markedly decreased (Fig. 4A	 second and third panel). These representative data from one out of three independent experiments strongly indicate that disease-associated CBL amino acid changes p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q abrogate CBL ubiquitin ligase activity. To measure the impact of CBL mutations on EGFR degradation	 we determined the amounts of total EGFR upon 60	120	 and 240 min of EGF stimulation. Ectopic expression of CBLWT induced a rapid loss of cellular EGFR within 60 min of EGF stimulation followed by constant EGFR levels over the rest of the observation period (Fig. 4B); this indicates that EGFR is subject to effective degradation. In contrast	 in cells transfected with empty vector	 EGFR levels slowly decreased over the time	 starting with a slight reduction of EGFR at 60 min to a marked loss at 240 min of EGF treatment (Fig. 4B). Cells expressing CBLK382E	 CBLD390Y	 or CBLR420Q showed very similar EGFR degradation kinetics to that of mock-transfected cells (Fig. 4B)	 which indicates loss of the stimulating effect of CBL on EGFR degradation. Interestingly	 it seemed that expression of CBLC381A most effectively blocks EGFR degradation (Fig. 4B). We verified these observations by densitometric measurements and statistical analysis of several independent experiments (Fig. 4C): CBLWT induced a reduction to 30.8% of initial EGFR after 60-min EGF stimulation	 whereas mock transfection or expression of CBLK382E	 CBLD390Y	 or CBLR420Q resulted in a decrease to 69.0%	68.80%	74.90%	 and 64.2% of initial EGFR	 respectively (Fig. 4C). These data demonstrate that the promoting effect of CBLWT on EGFR degradation is impaired by disease-associated mutations p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q. Notably	 the control mutant CBLC381A strongly delayed EGFR degradation with only 20% of initial EGFR amounts having been degraded at 240 min upon EGF treatment (Fig. 4C). This may indicate additional negative consequences of the p.C381A change on EGFR trafficking.  Figure 4.  Figure 4.

COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with CBL expression constructs (as indicated) or with empty vector (mock) together with HA-tagged ubiquitin and EGFR expression constructs. Subsequent to incubation under serum-starved culture conditions overnight	 cells were stimulated with 20 ng/ml EGF for 30 min (tEGF) and harvested in ice-cold RIPA buffer containing 10 mM N-ethylmaleimide to inhibit deubiquitylating enzymes. EGFR was immunoprecipitated with anti-EGFR antibodies and protein A-agarose and samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Levels of ubiquitylated EGFR in precipitates (ip) were monitored by using anti-HA antibodies. EGFR levels in total cell lysates (tcl) and precipitates (ip) were determined by using anti-EGFR antibodies and expression of CBL protein variants in total cell lysates was shown by using anti-CBL antibodies. Representative blots from one out of three independent experiments are shown. B and C: EGFR degradation. B: COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with CBL expression constructs or with empty vector (mock) as indicated and cultured under serum-starved conditions overnight. Next day	 cells were treated with 10 Î¼g/ml cycloheximide for 30 min to block protein synthesis and	 subsequently	 stimulated with 20 ng/ml EGF for 60	120	 or 240 min (tEGF) at 37Â°C or left untreated (0 min tEGF). Cell extracts (tcl) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-EGFR antibodies. Anti-tubulin antibodies were used to control for equal loading	 and the expression of CBL protein variants in total cell lysates was monitored by using anti-CBL antibodies; note that the gradually reduction of CBL protein expression after EGF treatment has been reported previously [Schmidt et al.	 2006]. C: Autoradiographic signals obtained from experiments as described in (B) were quantified by scanning densitometry. Amounts of EGFR in unstimulated cells (0 min tEGF) were considered as 100% and EGFR levels upon EGF stimulation (60	120	 and 240 min tEGF) are expressed as percentage of EGFR in unstimulated cells (0 min tEGF). Data represent the mean of n independent experiments Â± SD. One-way ANOVA between groups: P60 min < 0.05	 P120 min < 0.05	 P240 min < 0.05. Post hoc P values were calculated by unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01. Disease-associated mutations disrupt the ability of CBL to attenuate RAS-MAPK signaling  RASopathies are caused by hyperstimulation of RAS-MAPK signaling cascades [Aoki et al.	 2008]. Therefore	 by measuring ERK phosphorylation levels in COS-7 cells	 we determined activation of ERK proteins	 which are well-defined key players in RAS-MAPK signaling [Dhillon et al.	 2007]. We documented a time course for ERK phosphorylation upon EGF stimulation and we found no statistically significant differences after 10- and 30-min EGF stimulation between cells expressing CBLWT and either cells expressing disease-associated CBL protein variant or mock-transfected cells (Fig. 5A and B). At 60 min upon EGF stimulation	 cells expressing CBLWT showed reduced ERK1/2 phosphorylation compared with mock-transfected cells; however	 cells expressing CBLC381A	 CBLK382E	 CBLD390Y	 or CBLR420Q did not (Fig. 5A and B). In fact	 phospho-ERK1/2 levels were significantly increased in CBLC381A	 CBLK382E	 CBLD390Y	 or CBLR420Q cells relative to CBLWT-expressing cells at 60 min upon EGF stimulation (Fig. 5A and B). Quantification revealed between 1.43-fold and 2.24-fold higher ERK phosphorylation levels in cells expressing CBL mutant proteins or in mock-transfected cells than in CBLWT-expressing cells (Fig. 5B). We conclude that amino acid changes p.C381A	 p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q abrogate the potential of CBL to attenuate RAS-MAPK signaling.  Figure 5.  Figure 5.

A: COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with CBL expression constructs (as indicated) or with empty vector (mock) and cultured under serum-starved conditions overnight. Next day	 cells were stimulated with 20 ng/Î¼l EGF for 10 (10 min tEGF)	 30 (30 min tEGF)	 or 60 (60 min tEGF) min or left untreated (0 min tEGF). Subsequently	 total cell lysates (tcl) were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) and anti-ERK1/2 antibodies. Expression of CBL protein variants was monitored by immunoblotting using anti-CBL antibodies	 and anti-tubulin antibodies were used to control for equal loading. B: Autoradiographic signals obtained from experiments as described in (A) were quantified by scanning densitometry. Levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 was normalized relative to amounts of total ERK1/2 and ERK phosphorylation in cells expressing CBLWT was considered as 1. Thus	 the graphs show phosphorylation levels in mock-transfected cells and mutant CBL-expressing cells relative to that in cells expressing CBLWT (arbitrary units (a.u.)). Data represent the mean of n independent experiments Â± SD. One-way ANOVA between groups: P < 0.05. Post hoc P values were calculated by unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001. Discussion  Here	 we provide evidence that dysfunction of EGFR trafficking contributes to a clinically variable condition out of RASopathy-spectrum disorders. Defective endocytic sorting of receptors has been already proposed as a pathomechanistic basis for Noonan syndrome related phenotypes [Martinelli et al.	 2010]. By detailed analyses	 we could now demonstrate that RASopathy-associated amino acid changes p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q in the CBL RING domain (i) derange the cellular distribution of EGFR	 (ii) interfere with CBL-mediated ubiquitylation of EGFR	 (iii) abrogate the stimulating effect of CBL on EGFR degradation	 and (iv) disrupt CBL-mediated downregulation of RAS-MAPK signaling.  EGFR is internalized through different mechanisms: non-clathrin-mediated endocytosis (NCE) and clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) [Sorkin and Goh	 2009]. EGFR ubiquitylation seems to be indispensable for NCE [Sigismund et al.	 2013]	 whereas the need of EGFR ubiquitylation for CME is discussed controversially [Madshus and Stang	 2009; Sorkin and Goh	 2009; Haglund and Dikic	 2012; Sigismund et al.	 2012]. In line with our data on CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitylation (Fig. 4A)	 recently it has been reported that the disease-associated CBL amino acid changes p.D390Y and p.R420Q result in impaired EGFR ubiquitylation in response to EGF stimulation [Martinelli et al.	 2010]; this indicates loss-of-function consequences regarding the CBL ubiquitin ligase capacity. Several reports have shown that an intact CBL linker-RING domain is essential for EGF/EGFR internalization [e.g.	 Waterman et al.	 1999; Thien et al.	 2001; Jiang and Sorkin	 2003]. Taken together	 we suggest that RASopathy-associated amino acid changes	 which disrupt the ability of CBL to ubiquitylate EGFR	 compromise EGFR internalization and	 therefore	 result in higher amounts of surface and lower amounts of intracellular EGFR (Figs. 1B and C and 2). Notably	 intracellular EGFR levels in mock-transfected cells	 which lie between those in wild-type and mutant CBL-expressing cells (Fig. 2)	 may indicate a dominant-negative effect of CBL changes p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q on EGFR internalization. Accordingly	 dominant-negative effects of myeloid neoplasm-associated CBL missense mutations (p.Q367P	 p.Y371 S	 and p.R420Q) on CBL ubiquitin ligase function and receptor endocytosis have been demonstrated [Sargin et al.	 2007; Sanada et al.	 2009]. Dominant-negative consequences could be explained by competitive binding of mutant and wild-type CBL alleles to phosphotyrosine-containing motifs of activated EGFR in the combination with the inability of mutant CBL to recruit E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes to the RING domain. This	 however	 remains to be proved.  EGFR ubiquitylation is largely devoted to commit EGFR to lysosomal degradation [Haglund and Dikic	 2012]. In line with this	 we detected rapid and efficient EGFR degradation upon ectopic expression of CBLWT	 but not in cells expressing mutant CBL protein variants (Fig. 4A and B). Since all tested RASopathy-associated CBL variants and mock-transfection caused very similar degradation kinetics	 we suggest loss-of-function consequences of p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q on EGFR degradation. Interestingly	 the p.C381A mutation strongly delayed and blocked EGFR degradation. Cysteine 381 is a key residue for the binding of zinc	 an important cofactor for stabilizing the RING domain; mutations may disrupt zinc-chelating loops that accommodate significant contact with E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes [Zheng et al.	 2000]. However	 at the moment there is no valid mechanistic explanation for differing functional consequences of the p.C381A change and the RASopathy-associated mutations	 because all of these affect amino acids that seem to be essential for the formation of the binding interface for E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes [Zheng et al.	 2000; Martinelli et al.	 2010].  Noonan syndrome and related disorders are associated with dysregulated RAF-MAPK signal transduction [Schubbert et al.	 2007]. In cells expressing mutant CBL	 we detected ERK phosphorylation levels that were stronger than in CBLWT cells but similar to control cells (Fig. 5) indicating a loss of the ability to attenuate RAS-MAPK signaling. Thus	 this loss-of-function effect of RASopathy-associated CBL mutants is transformed into a gain of RAS-MAPK signaling. We conclude that inefficient degradation and affected internalization of EGFR (and possibly other CBL-regulated cell surface receptors) finally result in pronounced ligand-induced signaling events such as increased RAS-MAPK signal flux. This interrelation is well known from the pathogenesis of malignancies: enhanced RAS-MAPK signaling is common to human cancer and activating somatic mutations have been described in various genes encoding proteins of these signaling pathways [Dhillon et al.	 2007]; in addition	 somatic mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in the downregulation of receptors upstream of the RAS-MAPK signaling highway (e.g.	 CBL	 HIP1	 and TSG101) have been linked to malignancies [Bache et al.	 2004]. Consistently	 malfunction of the trafficking machinery inhibits either the early phase of receptor internalization or the transport of internalized receptor complexes toward degradation	 both of which promote the development of cancer [Dikic and Schmidt	 2007]. Taken together	 we suggest that RASopathy-associated lesions affect CBL binding with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes	 which results in loss of CBL ubiquitylation capacity and defective trafficking of EGFR (and other CBL-regulated cell surface receptors); this then again prolongs the availability of activated surface receptors in the cell	 which finally is transformed into increased RAS-MAPK signaling.  Germline CBL mutations are associated with a strikingly variable phenotype [Martinelli et al.	 2010; Niemeyer et al.	 2010; Perez et al.	 2010]	 as this is generally the case for Noonan syndrome and related disorders [Allanson et al.	 2010; Roberts et al.	 2013]. Modifier genes may explain these inter- and intragenic differences in disease expression indicating that these monogenic diseases rather are Mendelian disorders [Nadeau	 2001; Slavotinek and Biesecker	 2003; Genin et al.	 2008]. Since all the genes implicated in Noonan syndrome encode proteins integral to the EGFR-RAS-MAPK pathway	 phenocritical genetic modifiers may include genes involved in this signaling network. Remarkably	 Noonan syndrome and related disorders are caused by mutations in genes encoding more proximal components of RAS-MAPK signaling	 for example	 PTPN11 and SOS1	 whereas other RASopathies	 the cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome and Costello syndrome	 are associated with lesions in downstream components of RAS-MAPK cascades [Aoki et al.	 2008]. Therefore	 for Noonan syndrome it was proposed that in addition to RAS-MAPK signaling other downstream pathways could be affected	 which may account for the marked phenotypic variability [Roberts et al.	 2007]. Accordingly	 the position of CBL as the most upstream regulator of RAS-MAPK signaling associated with RASopathies by now may functionally explain the extreme clinical variability of patients with CBL germline mutations	 which has been reported recently [Martinelli et al.	 2010]. In this respect	 by describing a further regulatory level in the RASopathy network	 namely	 the trafficking of growth factor receptors upstream of RAS-MAPK signaling	 we underline the growing functional variability of RASopathy-associated gene lesions. Thereby	 we add important novel aspects to the knowledge of the pathophysiological basis of RASopathies	 which markedly expands the number of possible functional candidate genes for RAS-MAPK pathway associated diseases: mutations in genes coding for proteins that regulate trafficking of EGFR and other receptors upstream of RAS-MAPK signaling may account for genetically yet unclarified cases of RASopathies. This knowledge may facilitate the evaluation of genomic variants in exome data from mutation-negative patients with RASopathies and may open new pharmacogenomic approaches to rescue hyperstimulation of RAS-MAPK cascades. Oncogenic mutations in the monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) gene have been found in many tumors	 but their significance remains largely unknown. Several human c-Cbl (CBL) structures have recently been solved depicting the protein at different stages of its activation cycle and thus provide mechanistic insight underlying how stability-activity tradeoffs in cancer-related proteins may influence disease onset and progression. In this study	 we computationally modeled the effects of missense cancer mutations on structures representing four stages of the CBL activation cycle to identify driver mutations that affect CBL stability	 binding	 and activity. We found that recurrent	 homozygous	 and leukemia-specific mutations had greater destabilizing effects on CBL states than did random non-cancer mutations. We further tested the ability of these computational models assessing the changes in CBL stability and its binding to ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2	 by performing blind CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays in cells. Experimental CBL ubiquitin ligase activity was in agreement with the predicted changes in CBL stability and	 to a lesser extent	 with CBL-E2 binding affinity. Two-thirds of all experimentally tested mutations affected the ubiquitin ligase activity by either destabilizing CBL or disrupting CBL-E2 binding	 whereas about one-third of tested mutations were found to be neutral. Collectively	 our findings demonstrate that computational methods incorporating multiple protein conformations and stability and binding affinity evaluations can successfully predict the functional consequences of cancer mutations on protein activity	 and provide a proof of concept for mutations in CBL.  Keywords: CBL	 driver mutations	 protein interactions Go to: Introduction Whole exome sequencing of cancer patients has produced unprecedented amounts of data to analyze and interpret; these studies report a very large fraction of missense mutations which can potentially be implicated in tumorigenensis (1). Although some missense mutations can provide selective growth advantage to tumor cells (driver mutations)	 the large majority of them are considered to be neutral (passenger mutations). The mechanisms by which the driver variants may affect protein stability	 interactions	 and function remain largely unknown. Various computational methods have been developed to estimate the impacts of disease mutations on proteins but most of them exclusively use sequence features and do not explicitly utilize the protein three-dimensional structures	 their physico-chemical properties and dynamics (2	 3). Many cancers are characterized by (de)activation of certain proteins which may be a result of missense mutations (4). The interconversion between active and inactive states is highly regulated in proteins and it is not well understood how these regulatory mechanisms are disrupted in cancer. The development of in silico approaches to estimate the effects of disease mutations on protein activity	 stability and binding will help to define which are likely to be driver or passenger mutations. Moreover	 understanding the mechanisms of their actions would allow for prioritization of potential driver candidates for better targeted therapies to design drugs which might in turn compensate for the reduced/enhanced protein stability or activity.  The monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) RING finger ubiquitin ligase (E3) represents an exceptionally difficult yet important system to study the mechanisms of cancer mutations (5	 6). Strikingly	 proteins from this family play both positive and negative regulatory roles in tyrosine kinase signaling which is aberrantly activated in many cancers (5). Oncogenic mutations in the c-Cbl gene (referred to as CBL thereafter) were found in human myeloid neoplasms and other tumors (5) but the significance of these mutations and their impacts on CBL function were studied only for very few mutants (7). The mechanistic aspects of CBL cancer mutations can now be adequately addressed as several CBL structures have become available which represent the snapshots of different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1). All CBL proteins share a highly conserved N-terminus which includes a tyrosine kinaseâ€“binding domain (TKBD)	 a linker helix region (LHR) and a RING finger domain	 while the C-terminus comprises a proline-rich region (8). The RING domain of CBL has E3 activity and ubiquitinates activated receptor tyrosine kinases which subsequently targets them for degradation (8). At the same time	 since CBL proteins can bind to activated receptor tyrosine kinases via the TKBD domain	 they can serve as adaptors by recruiting downstream signal transduction components such as SHP2 and P13K (9	 10).  Figure 1 Figure 1 CBL activation cycle. The structures representing the activation cycle of CBL are shown. In the inactive closed state (nCBL) the protein exists in the cytosol. Upon activation of the RTK	 CBL can bind to the phosphorylated RTK (orange peptide) via TKBD ... Another aspect of CBL function which should be accounted for in modeling the effects of cancer mutations is that it can bind to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) in complex with ubiquitin (Ub) and a substrate protein	 thereby facilitating the transfer of Ub from E2 to a lysine residue of the substrate (11). The crystal structure of the inactive complex of CBL with E2 (UbcH7) was solved more than ten years ago (12) while the active phosphorylated CBL-E2 (UbcH5B) complex was resolved fairly recently (13). According to the latter study	 substrate binding and Tyr371 phosphorylation activates CBL by producing a large conformational change in order to place the RING domain and E2 in close proximity to the substrate. It was further confirmed that phosphorylation-induced conformational change is required for positioning of ubiquitin for effective catalysis (14).  Here we present a new approach	 which aims to assess the effects of cancer mutations on stability	 binding and activity of cancer related proteins. We apply computational models to four different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1) and perform blind in vivo experiments of CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination. We show a rather remarkable agreement of experimental EGFR ubiquitination by CBL mutants with the computed changes in CBL thermodynamic stability and to a lesser extent with CBL-E2 binding affinity. The computational models not only quantitatively predict the magnitude of the effects of mutations but also shed light on the mechanisms of their action. Namely	 we find that cancer mutations have greater destabilizing effects on four CBL states than random non-cancer mutations for recurrent	 homozygous and leukemia mutations. Most damaging cancer mutations happen in the sites involved in Zn-coordination and in the formation of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds within CBL or between CBL and E2. Overall cancer driver mutations affect different or multiple stages of the CBL activation cycle either completely abolishing its E3 activity or partially attenuating it. The computational models based on stability and binding affinity calculations can discriminate experimentally validated driver from passenger mutations (with the exception of two mutations) and outperform several state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods aiming to predict phenotypic impacts of mutations.  Go to: Materials and Methods Computational modeling and analysis  Mapping of CBL mutations The COSMIC database (15) stores data on somatic cancer mutations and integrates the experimental data from full-genome sequencing studies. We extracted 103 missense mutations for the CBL gene from the COSMIC database (15) that could be mapped to four available CBL structures in its activation cycle (Fig. 1). Cancer mutations were classified into different classes according to the frequency of observed samples (single and recurrent mutations)	 zygosity (homo- and heterozygous mutations)	 types of cancer (leukemia and sarcoma) and the involvement of mutations in Zn-coordination (Table S1). In addition	 all possible single nucleotide substitutions resulting in amino-acid changes in the CBL gene were performed to obtain a â€œRandomâ€ missense mutation reference set. After excluding mutations observed in COSMIC and mutations occurring on residues without known coordinates in crystal structures	 we obtained 2	102 random missense mutations (Table S1). We also searched the dbSNP database (16) but found very few benign variations in the CBL gene. Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.  Model preparation We investigated the effects of mutations on four states of the CBL activation cycle: (1) closed CBL state (nCBL)	 (2) partially opened CBL state bound to substrate (CBL-S)	 (3) unphosphorylated autoinhibitory CBL bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and (4) phosphorylated CBL bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1). It was previously noted that both UbcH5B and UbcH7 can bind specifically to CBL but only UbcH5B can facilitate ubiquitination (17). The crystal structures of nCBL (PDB id: 2Y1M) (13)	 CBL-S (PDB id: 2Y1N) (13) and pCBL-E2-S (PDB id: 4A4C) (13) were obtained directly from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (18). Only one crystal structure of the unphosphorylated inactive state of CBL bound to E2 (UbcH7) and Zap-70 peptide (PDB id: 1FBV) (12) was available in PDB. Although sequence identity between UbcH7 and UbcH5B proteins is 38%	 the structural similarity is very high with the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.04 Ã…. The unphosphorylated autoinhibitory structure of CBL-UbcH5B-S was therefore modeled based on CBL-UbcH7-S (PDB id: 1FBV) using Chimera (19). (Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.)  Minimization procedure We applied our recently developed optimization protocol for minimizing wild-type and mutant structures (20). Heavy side chain atoms without known coordinates and hydrogen atoms were added to the crystal structures using the VMD (version 1.9.1) program (21) with models immersed into rectangular boxes of water molecules extending up to 10 Ã… from the protein in each direction. Wild-type protein complexes were minimized for 40	000 steps using explicit TIP3P water model. The final minimized models of wild-type protein complexes were used to produce all mutant structures and then an additional 300-step minimization for all mutant structures was performed. The energy minimization was carried out with the NAMD program (version 2.9) (22) using the CHARMM27 force field (23). For unfolding free energy calculations we applied the optimization procedure implemented in the RepairPDB module of the FoldX program (24) which optimizes the side chain configurations to provide a repaired structure. (See Supplementary Materials and Methods for more information.)  Binding and unfolding free energy calculations Binding free energy and effects of mutations on binding affinity were calculated according to the approach introduced by us earlier (20). Energy calculations were based on the modified MM-PBSA method that combined the molecular mechanics terms with the Poissonâ€“Boltzmann continuum representation of the solvent (25) and statistical scoring energy functions with parameters optimized on experimental sets of several thousand mutations (equation 3). Binding free energy calculations were performed on minimized wild-type and mutant structures of inactive CBL-E2-S and active pCBL-E2-S states. The binding energy is defined as a difference between the free energies of the complex and unbound proteins.  Î”Gbind=GCBL-E2-S-GCBL-S-GE2 (1) The change of binding energy due to a mutation can be calculated as:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î”Gbindmut-Î”GbindWT (2) The effect of mutations on binding affinity was calculated in this work using the following energy function:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î±Î”Î”Evdw+Î²Î”Î”Gsolv+Î³Î”SAmut+ÎµÎ”Î”GBM+Î»Î”Î”GFD+Î´ (3) Here Î”Î”Evdw is the change of the van der Waals interaction energy and Î”Î”Gsolv is the change of the polar solvation energy of solute in water. Î”SAmut represents a term proportional to the interface area of the mutant complex. Î”Î”GBM and Î”Î”GFD are the binding energy changes from BeAtMuSiC and FoldX	 respectively. BeAtMuSiC (26) estimates the effect of mutations on binding based on statistical potentials.  The FoldX software program (24) was used to estimate the unfolding free energy and to model the unfolding state. FoldX calculates the effects of mutations on protein stability using an empirical force field. The BuildModel module was used to introduce a mutation	 optimize the configurations of the neighboring side chains and calculate the difference in stability (unfolding free energy) between mutant ( Î”Gfoldmut) and repaired native structure ( Î”GfoldWT).  Î”Î”Gfold=Î”Gfoldmut-Î”GfoldWT (4) For comparison we used three alternative methods to predict the impacts of mutations on unfolding free energy: the Eris server (27)	 the Rosetta program (28) and the PoPMuSiC server (29). We also applied four additional webtools to assess the impacts of amino acid substitutions on CBL function: PROVEAN (30)	 PolyPhen-2 (31)	 MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). (See Supplementary Methods for more information.)  Go to: Experimental procedures Expression constructs  Human CBL cDNA was originally obtained from Wallace Langdon and subsequently cloned into the pCEFL expression plasmid (34). Point mutation constructs	 described above	 were created from wild-type CBL using the QuikChange II Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions (Stratagene	 La Jolla	 CA). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.  Cell culture and transfections  The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T	 the human nonsmall cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the human cervical cancer cell line HeLa used in this study were originally obtained from ATCC and maintained in culture using DMEM (Gibco	 Grand Island	 NY) supplemented with 10% FBS	 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin sulfate. Cell lines were authenticated by Short Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis by using either Promega Powerplex 16 (Promega	 Madison	 WI) or the AmpFISTR Identifier Kit (Life Technologies	 Carlsbad	 CA) and compared to the ATCC or DSMZ databases. HeLa cells were received in the lab in 2013 last authenticated on 7-30-15	 A549 were received in the lab in 2015 and last authenticated on 8-12-15	 and HEK293T were received in the lab in 1995 and last authenticated on 10-8-15.HEK293T cells were transfected using calcium phosphate according to the instructions accompanying the reagent (Profection; Promega Corp.	 Madison	 WI)	 incubated 18 h prior to media change and grown for a total of 48 h prior to harvesting. A549 and Hela cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen	 Carlsbad	 CA). Transfections were allowed to incubate 6 h prior to media change	 and cells were grown an additional 48 h before being harvested. Cells were starved for 4 hours and treated with EGF (100 ng/ul). Each cell-based experiment was repeated at least two times.  Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation  To harvest proteins	 cells were washed twice in ice-cold Dulbeccoâ€™s PBS-containing 200 Î¼M sodium orthovanadate (Fisher Chemicals	 Fairlawn	 NJ) then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5	 150 mM NaCl	 5 mM EDTA	 1% Triton X-100	 10% glycerol	 100 mM iodoacetamide [Sigma-Aldrich Corp.	 St. Louis	 MO]	 2 mM sodium orthovanadate	 and protease inhibitors [Complete tabsÂ®	 Roche Diagnostics Corp.	 Indianapolis	 IN]). All whole cell lysates were cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 16	000 Ã— g for 15 m at 4 Â°C. Supernatant protein concentrations were determined using the BioRad protein assay (BioRad	 Hercules	 CA). For immunoblotting	 20Î¼g of whole cell lysates were boiled in a 1:1 dilution of 2X loading buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8	 10% glycerol	 2% SDS	 1 mg/ml bromophenol blue	 0.3573 M Î²-mercaptoethanol) for 5 m. For immunoprecipitations	 150 Î¼g of each of the whole cell lysates were incubated with rabbit anti-EGFR (Ab-3; Millipore) and with Protein A/G+ agarose beads (sc-2003; Santa Cruz Biotechnology	 Santa Cruz	 CA). All immunoprecipitations were incubated overnight at 4Â°C with tumbling. Immune complexes were washed five times in 1 mL cold lysis buffer	 then resuspended in 2X loading buffer	 boiled for 5 m	 then resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran BA85; Whatman	 Sanford	 MA). For immunoblot detection of proteins	 the following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-EGFR (2232L; Cell Signaling)	 rat monoclonal high affinity anti-HA-peroxidase	 (clone 3F10; Roche)	 rabbit anti-Cbl (sc-C-15; Santa Cruz) and mouse anti-Hsc70 (sc-7298; Santa Cruz). Horseradish peroxidase linked donkey anti-rabbit IgG (NA934V; GE Healthcare	 Piscataway	 NJ)	 or donkey anti-mouse IgG (NA931: GE Healthcare	 Piscataway	 NJ) immunoglobulin was used with SuperSignal (Pierce Biotechnology Inc.	 Rockford	 IL) to visualize protein detection.  Densitometric Analysis  Immunoblots were developed on HyBlot CL Autoradiography Film (Denville Scientific Inc.	 South Plainfield	 NJ) with an X-OMAT automated processor (Eastman Kodak	 Rochester	 NY). Protein expression levels were then recorded using an Epson Perfection V750 PRO scanner (Epson Inc.	 Long Beach	 CA) and densitometric analysis was performed using Adobe Photoshop software version 7.0 (Adobe Systems Inc.	 U.S.A). EGFR ubiquitination signal intensity was determined by optical density in a set area normalized against the EGFR band intensity in parallel immunoblots and expressed as a densitometric ratio of ubiquitination/EGFR levels. The mean densitometric ratio of EGFR ubiquitination	 in the presence of each CBL mutation	 was then assessed relative to wild-type CBL where the ratio was set at 1.0.  Go to: Results Cancer mutations impact CBL stability  We estimated the thermodynamic stability (unfolding free energy) changes	 Î”Î”Gfold	 upon mutation for closed (nCBL) and partially opened (CBL-S) CBL states (Fig. 1). These states did not involve binding to E2. The examination of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for random non-cancer mutations (Fig. 2A) showed that it was very similar to experimental distributions produced by random mutagenesis on a set of different proteins (35	 36). Namely	 the distribution for random non-cancer mutations was asymmetrically centered at positive energy values and there were about 10% of random mutations with highly damaging effects on CBL structures by more than 5 kcal molâˆ’1 (Fig. 2A). Despite the presence of highly damaging random mutations	 recurrent cancer mutations overall produced significantly larger destabilizing effects compared to random (p-value â‰ª 0.01) for both nCBL and CBL-S states (Fig. 2A and S1	 Table S2). This was not the case for single cancer mutations observed in only one patient (Table S2). Overall	 the form of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for recurrent cancer mutations was different from the Î”Î”Gfold distribution of random mutations (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p-value â‰ª 0.01) whereas the distribution for single cancer mutations was indistinguishable from a random mutation distribution. However	 it does not mean that all single cancer mutants can be considered passenger	 as we show later	 this is not the case for some of them.  Figure 2 Figure 2 (A) The distribution of unfolding (Î”Î”Gfold) and binding (Î”Î”Gbind) free energy changes for Single	 Recurrent and Random class mutations on nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states (see SI for other states). Positive and negative values ... The top 25% cancer mutations with the largest damaging effects are presented in Table S3. Many of them occurred in Zn-coordinating sites while many others did not involve Zn-coordination sites. Some of these latter mutations (G415V	 G413R and G415S) introduced large Van der Waals clashes with neighboring residues which could not be accommodated by side chain rearrangements	 whereas other mutations (S376F	 Y371D and L405P) affected disulfide or hydrogen bonds. For example	 L405P located in the middle of an Î±-helix affected the CBL structure by introducing an energetically unfavorable kink in the helix due to its inability to donate an amide hydrogen bond.  Effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding  The outcome of mutations can be assessed by the extent of structural changes they induce. We calculated the local root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between the minimized wild-type and mutant structures around the mutated site. We found that the protein backbone in the vicinity of a mutation of the CBL-E2 complex underwent larger local conformational changes upon recurrent cancer mutations	 especially for mutations occurring in Zn-coordinating site clusters	 compared to random mutations (p-value â‰ª 0.01	 Fig. S2 and S3). In the previous section we analyzed the original closed (nCBL) state and partially opened (CBL-S) state induced by substrate binding. In this section we study the effects of cancer mutations on two other CBL states: an autoinhibitory CBL state bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and phosphorylated active CBL state bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1) (13). Effects of mutations on binding can be in general linked with their structural locations	 therefore we examined the locations of mutations and found that about one third of all cancer mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface (Fig. S4). This preference was found to be statistically significant (p-value â‰ª 0.01) (Fig. S4).  It was previously experimentally shown that binding between CBL and E2 was rather weak with a micromolar dissociation constant (13). Despite the fact that the interface between CBL and E2 in the inactive state is several residues larger than in the active state	 consistent with experiments	 we found somewhat stronger binding between CBL and E2 for the active state of CBL (Table S4). Similarly to the impacts of cancer mutations on stability	 recurrent (but not single) mutations destabilized CBL-E2 binding significantly (Fig. 2B	 S1 and Table S2). Importantly	 cancer mutations reduced the CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state (p-value = 0.002) (Fig. 2B) and the effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding of the active state were noticeably larger compared to random mutations even if we excluded mutations in Zn-coordinating sites (Table S2). This latter observation does not hold true for the autoinhibitory CBL-E2-S conformation.  Next	 all cancer mutations were ranked with respect to their effects on CBL-E2 binding. About half of all highly damaging mutations (top 25% of most damaging mutations	 Table S3) impacted both stability and CBL-E2 binding for all four CBL states. Among them	 several mutations occurred in Zn-coordinating clusters and M400 and L405 sites. Another class of mutations (involving W408 and R420 sites) mostly influenced CBL-E2 binding. For example	 the W408S mutation caused the largest perturbation in CBL-E2 binding of the active state by decreasing binding affinity up to 3.5 kcal molâˆ’1 but having a moderate effect on stability of the nCBL and CBL-S states. It was previously suggested that amino acids in positions W408 and I383 constituted specificity of CBL-E2 binding and corresponded to binding hot spots (10	 12). Mutations in the I383 site are not recorded in the COSMIC database although they have a profound destabilizing effect on CBL-E2 binding for both states (see data for random mutations on the ftp site ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/panch/CBL). Another site affecting binding of CBL (R420) is a highly conserved site in the CBL family	 it strongly interacts with the Q92	 W93 and S94 residues of E2. It was previously experimentally verified that mutations in this site disrupted the CBL activity and could be associated with cytokine-independent growth (37). There are 24 cancer patient samples where mutations of this site (R420Q	 R420L and R420P) are found and they all produce strong destabilizing effects on the active pCBL-E2-S state.  According to the zygosity annotation	 there are 49 heterozygous (â€œHeteroâ€) and 27 homozygous (â€œHomoâ€) mutations (Table S1) and for the rest of cancer mutations their zygocity status is undetermined. Overall	 we found that destabilizing mutations were enriched among homozygous compared to heterozygous mutations for all stages of CBL activation cycle (p-value = 0.021 â€“ 0.035) and were more prevalent in leukemia compared to sarcoma patients (p-value = 0.000 â€“ 0.003) (Fig. 2B	 Table S2). This observation could not be attributed to the prevalence of homozygous mutations in Zn-coordinating clusters since these clusters had almost equal numbers of heterozygous and homozygous mutations. It was reported earlier that many homozygous mutations could be connected to uniparental disomy when germline heterozygosity would lead to neoplasia upon reduction to homozygosity (6	38	 39). If some patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms had germline heterozygous mutations in CBL	 then lost the wild-type CBL allele and duplicated mutant allele	 it would be possible that the damaging mutant allele would be duplicated in a cancer cell with a higher probability. Indeed	 human leukemia samples show the loss of the normal CBL allele.  CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination: comparing experiments with computational models  Next we randomly picked fifteen cancer mutations based on their predicted damaging status	 trying to equally sample highly damaging and benign mutations irrespective to their frequencies in cancer samples	 and experimentally tested the E3 activity of wild-type and mutant CBL proteins (see Methods	 Table 1). As can be seen in Fig. 3A	 in the presence of wild-type CBL	 activation of the EGFR induced more than a 10-fold increase in the ubiquitination of the EGFR compared to empty vector (endogenous CBL levels) in HEK293T cells (compare lane 4 to lane 2 in top panel of Fig. 3A). The E3 activity of wild-type CBL was mirrored by a decrease in the levels of immunoprecipitated EGFR consistent with the targeting of ubiquitinated EGFR for degradation (compare lanes 2 and 4 in second panel of Fig. 3A).  Figure 3 Figure 3 (A) EGFR ubiquitination. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant CBL proteins along with the EGFR and hemagglutinin (HA)-epitope tagged ubiquitin. The vector control and wild-type	 CBL transfectant cells were incubated ... Table 1 Table 1 Experimental relative densitometry values for HEK293T cells	 predicted changes in stability (Î”Î”Gfold kcal molâˆ’1)	 binding affinity (Î”Î”Gbind kcal molâˆ’1) and comparison with other methods for 15 experimentally ... We classified all mutations into three groups (damaging	 attenuating and benign) according to their experimental relative densitometry data and compared experimental data with the estimates produced by the computational models. The first group of damaging mutants included C396R	 H398Q	 Y371H	 K382E and C381A which completely abolished CBL activity (relative densitometry was less than 10%) (Fig. 3B) and the levels of total EGFR were not decreased by these mutants (Fig. 3A). Only two of these mutants belonged to the Recurrent class of mutations. Table 1 shows predicted and experimentally verified effects of mutations on all four CBL states. All five mutants were predicted to be damaging by stability and binding affinity calculations but the mechanisms of their action were different. C396R	 H398Q and C381A mutations disrupted Zn-coordinating clusters and had very damaging consequences according to the stability model for both nCBL and CBL-S states and damaging effects on CBL-E2 binding even though none of these mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface. On the other hand	 the K382E mutation did not affect Zn-coordination but destabilized the nCBL state. This	 in turn	 could be explained by the charge substitution that led to the disruption of the K382-E373 salt bridge within the closed state of nCBL (Figure 4 and Figure S5A). Moreover	 K382E mutation had a significant impact on CBL-E2 binding due to the disruption of a salt bridge between pY371 and K382 affecting the stability of CBL in the active state (Figure 4 and Figure S5D). No significant changes were observed for CBL-S and CBL-E2-S states (Figure S5B	C). K382E mutation was previously observed in Noonan syndrome and was speculated to affect CBL stability or binding (40). Finally	 the Y371H mutation not only abolished phosphorylation at the Y371 site but also had a profound destabilizing effect on all four states as evident from Table 1.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Structures of wild type (green) and K382E mutant (tan) are shown for nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states. Salt bridges are shown as dashed lines and in both cases mutation affects the stability by disrupting the salt bridge. The second group of mutants (M374V	 V430M	 P428L	 Q249E and double mutant S80N/H94Y) maintained the CBL activity equivalent to or greater than wild-type CBL (relative densitometry of 80% or higher) (Fig. 3B). Consistent with this	 the levels of the activated EGFR were also decreased in these samples (Fig. 3A). To confirm that the retained E3 activity of these mutants was not cell type specific	 we transfected these mutants into the non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the cervical cancer cell line Hela (Fig. S6). The S80N/H94Y and Q249E mutations were previously identified in human non-small cell lung cancers making the A549 cell line a relevant cell type to investigate the function of these CBL mutants while other cancer mutations were found in other cancer types. As in the HEK293T cells	 transfection of wild-type CBL into A549 and HeLa cells resulted in a significant increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of EGFR compared to the cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. S6). The increase in transfected CBL protein compared to endogenous CBL protein was less in HeLa than in either the A549 or HEK293T cells. Consistent with this	 the fold increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of the EGFR by wild-type CBL was smaller in Hela cells (about three fold) compared to either A549 or HEK293T cells (more than 10 fold in each). As in HEK293T cells	 the Y371H mutant did not stimulate ubiquitination compared to the vector transfected control for A549 or HeLa cells (Fig. S6A and C). The CBL mutants that were fully active in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3A and B) maintained CBL E3 activity in A549 and HeLa cells (Fig. S6). Two of these CBL mutants resulted in more ubiquitination of EGFR compared to wild type CBL. For example	 the Q249E mutant showed an increased ubiquitination of EGFR in 293T and HeLa cells while the M374V mutant resulted in higher ubiquitination levels in A549 and HeLa cells (Figure 3 and S6). Only V430M mutant was on the borderline with the densitometry ratio of 0.8. All mutations from the second group were predicted to be benign according to our computational models	 whereas V430M	 consistent with experimental data	 had a borderline destabilizing impact on CBL-E2 binding (Table 1).  Finally	 the third group constituted mutations (L399V	 G375P	 P395A and V391I) which attenuated the CBL E3 activity according to the relative densitometry data (Fig. 3B). Only one of these mutants was observed in two cancer samples while other three belonged to the Single mutation class. Concordant with this	 there were intermediate levels of EGFR (Fig. 3A). G375P and P395A mutations were predicted to have partially damaging effects while V391I and L399V were classified as benign in our predictions. Interestingly	 mutations from this third group affected only some of the CBL states. In contrast	 the highly damaging mutations from the first group had damaging impacts on almost all CBL states.  Next we tested if the reduction in CBL ubiquitination activity was directly correlated with the effects of mutations on stability (Fig. 5A). The relationship between experimental densitometry data and Î”Î”Gfold was better described by an exponential dependence with correlation coefficient (R) of 0.77 and 0.78 for CBL-S and nCBL states respectively (Table S5). Indeed	 the change in absorption between wild-type and mutant proteins which refers to a fraction of active mutants can be described by the Boltzmann equation relating the probability of a state with the energy of this state. A mutation may lead to damaging effects and a loss of function if it impacts at least one of the CBL functional states. Taking this into consideration we calculated the correlation between densitometry and stability changes taking a maximum of Î”Î”Gfold values for the nCBL and CBL-S states. As shown in Fig. 5A and Table S5	 changes in stability can indeed explain the effects of mutations on CBL ubiquitination activity with high correlation of R = 0.83. For comparison	 several alternative methods were applied to predict the effect of mutations on unfolding free energy	 they all reported correlation coefficients ranging from 0.21 to 0.52	 with only one method PopMusic reporting a statistically significant correlation of 0.52 (Table S5). The relationship between densitometry and binding affinity changes was on the borderline of significance with a linear correlation coefficient of 0.48 and 0.62 (if two highly damaging mutations were excluded) (Fig. 5B and Table S5).  Figure 5 Figure 5 (A) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (exponential model) and maximal predicted changes in stability. (B) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (linear model) and predicted changes in binding affinity of pCBL-E2-S state. ... There are various methods which predict the phenotypic effects of mutations	 (30â€“33	 41) and some of them use structural features (31	 41). We applied four state-of-the-art independent methods to predict the impacts of mutations on CBL function: PROVEAN (30)	 PolyPhen-2 (31)	 MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). Some of these methods outperformed our model in classifying cancer from random mutations since they were trained to distinguish disease from neutral variants (Table S6). However	 all four methods had a very limited accuracy in classifying CBL cancer mutations into those that disrupted function and those that did not. As evident from Table 1 and Table S5	 all methods except for PROVEAN over-predicted damaging effects of experimentally tested mutations while PROVEAN was the only method which produced a significant correlation between the densitometry data and PROVEANâ€™s score (R=0.58	 Table S5).  Go to: Discussion Stability-activity balance in cancer related proteins  Evolutionary selection to maintain structural	 foldable and functional proteins eliminates many mutations in protein sequences. On the other hand	 thermodynamic stability can be compromised in evolution to ensure certain arrangements of catalytic and binding sites	 which might not be energetically optimal (36	 42). In tumorigenesis	 protein stability or binding may be reduced (or in some cases increased) due to cancer mutations. As a consequence it can lead to decreased fitness at the protein level	 but may confer a fitness advantage for the population of tumor cells (43	 44). However	 the extent of the stability-activity tradeoff in oncogenes and tumor suppressors remains largely unknown. Using the example of the CBL protein	 here we tried to elucidate the stability-activity balance and to understand whether the loss or gain of activity in cancer-related proteins can be accompanied by compromised stability or binding.  In contrast to many other computational studies	 which attempt to link stability with activity by mostly focusing on one protein conformation	 we performed an analysis on four different stages of the CBL activation cycle. Our predictions of changes in stability and binding were further elucidated by the experimental CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays. We found a strong relationship between the effects of mutations on CBL stability and experimentally obtained densitometry data (quantifying activity)	 while a relatively weaker correlation was observed between changes in densitometry and CBL-E2 binding affinity. It could be explained either by a less significant impact of experimentally tested mutations on CBL-E2 binding or by a limited coupling (compared to CBL stability) between CBL-E2 binding and E3 activity.  Drivers or passengers?  According to our study	 about two thirds of all experimentally tested mutations either completely abolished or attenuated E3 activity	 while one third of them were neutral. Trying to assess the limitations of our models	 we applied state-of- the-art methods commonly used to predict functional effects of mutations. However	 these methods failed to distinguish inactivating from neutral mutations as accurately as the computational models which were solely based on accounting for the effects on stability and binding for different CBL states. Indeed	 many methods are not specifically designed to discriminate driver from passenger mutations within the pool of cancer mutations	 but rather they perform a task of distinguishing cancer from neutral mutations.  Certainly	 the large majority of all mutations detected in cancer genomics studies are likely to be neutral although the collective burden of passenger mutations may also alter the course of tumorigenesis (45). When we analyzed the distribution of all single cancer missense mutations observed in the CBL gene	 their average effects on stability or binding were not found to be significantly different from the pool of random mutations. These mutations either mostly constitute true passenger mutations or their oncogenic mechanisms are not directly connected to protein destabilization. The story is quite the opposite for the recurrent mutations as they have on average significantly higher destabilizing effects than random mutations and the majority of them should be drivers. An interesting group of mutations includes those which are highly damaging but found only in one cancer sample (10% of all single cancer mutations). These mutations may represent either rare driver or latent driver mutations (46). Several of these mutations were experimentally tested and are listed in Table 1.  CBL-E2 binding in deciphering the mechanisms of cancer  Our analysis showed that cancer mutations reduce CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state. It is in contrast to the stability-activity tradeoff reported for EGFR and other cancer related proteins (47)	 where cancer mutations may disrupt autoinhibitory interactions and activate the kinase (48	 49). Importantly	 all mutations with experimentally tested high inactivating effects have impacts on both CBL stability and CBL-E2 binding (Table 1). In fact	 the correlation between Î”Î”Gfold and Î”Î”Gbind for CBL cancer mutations from COSMIC is positive (R = 0.20 â€“ 0.48 depending on the CBL state	 p-value < 0.05). It might seem counterintuitive as some residues maintain stability by sustaining the RING-TKBD autoinhibitory interactions within CBL. This interface overlaps with the CBL-E2 interface and competes against E2 binding (13). One might think that disruption of RING-TKBD interactions and destabilization of CBL might facilitate binding to E2 and therefore lead to CBL activation. A slight activation was actually observed for two mutants	 one of which (M374V) was directly located on the CBL-E2 interface. However	 as we showed through the positive high correlation between stability and activity changes	 this mechanism is rarely observed and the vast majority of mutations disrupt CBL-E3 activity by either destabilizing CBL and/or CBL-E2 binding or by directly affecting phosphorylation of the critical tyrosine Y371.  Overall	 our results support the idea that decrease of E3 activity	 of the ability to ubiquitinate receptor tyrosine kinases	 of CBL stability and/or CBL-E2 binding can give a selective advantage for tumor cells. However	 there are several factors that complicate deciphering the mechanisms of action of CBL cancer mutations. CBL mutations can be dominant-negative and mutated CBL might not only change the CBL E3 activity but also might affect the concentration and activity of the wild-type CBL. According to a ratiometric method to identify driver genes in cancer (1)	 CBL can be regarded as an oncogene since it has several mutation hot spots. On the other hand	 as shown in our study and in other studies	 cancer driver mutations can inactivate the E3 activity of CBL	 so it can also be regarded as a tumor suppressor. Although the latter fact complicates the development of CBL targeted therapies	 understanding the delicate balance among different CBL-affected pathways may facilitate the indirect drug targeting of damaged CBL proteins. The current genetics-based frameworks to analyze cancer genome-wide sequence data are necessary but not sufficient for understanding the processes of carcinogenesis and developing informed	 targeted therapies. Our approach	 which can be applied in general to different proteins of interest	 emphasizes the importance of the physics of binding and protein conformational ensembles in deducing the mechanisms of cancer.  																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																
4	12||Noonan syndrome is an autosomal dominant congenital disorder that encompasses effects on multiple organ systems	 including distinctive facial features	 heart defects	 a short stature	 learning difficulties	 a predisposition to malignancies	 and other clinical manifestations [Roberts et al.	 2013]. It belongs to a group of genetic syndromes	 the RASopathies or RAS pathway disorders	 which are caused by mutations in genes that encode proteins involved in RAS-MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathways [Zenker	 2011]. Germline mutations in PTPN11	 SOS1	 KRAS	 NRAS	 RAF1	 BRAF	 MAP2K1	 or RIT1 underlie Noonan syndrome [Aoki et al.	 2013; Roberts et al.	 2013]. Disease-causing mutations usually enhance signal flow through RAS-MAPK cascades [Schubbert et al.	 2007]. Moreover	 mutations in two genes	 SHOC2 and CBL (MIM# 165360)	 have been reported in patients with Noonan-like phenotypes and additional untypical features [Cordeddu et al.	 2009; Martinelli et al.	 2010; Niemeyer et al.	 2010; Perez et al.	 2010]. Besides	 somatic CBL mutations have been found in various myeloproliferative disorders [Caligiuri et al.	 2007; Sargin et al.	 2007; Loh et al.	 2009; Makishima et al.	 2009; Muramatsu et al.	 2010].  CBL (also known as c-Cbl) is a multifunctional adaptor protein with ubiquitin ligase (E3) activity	 thereby catalyzing ubiquitylation of substrate proteins [Schmidt and Dikic	 2005]. CBL function has been implicated in ligand-mediated internalization and postendocytic sorting of various cell-surface proteins such as the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) [Piper and Lehner	 2011]	 which is a major cellular access to the RAS-MAPK signaling highway. In the present model	 CBL is recruited to the activated EGFR directly by interaction with the receptor at a phosphotyrosine residue [Levkowitz et al.	 1999] and indirectly through the adaptor protein Grb2 [Waterman et al.	 2002; Jiang et al.	 2003]. E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes are then recruited to the RING domain of CBL to promote receptor ubiquitylation; subsequently	 ubiquitin-binding proteins (e.g.	 Epsin) and other endocytic proteins (e.g.	 AP-2) attach and mediate EGFR internalization [Sorkin and Goh	 2009]. After trafficking into endosomes	 EGFR can either be recycled back to the plasma membrane or transported into lysosomes for degradation	 and ubiquitylation of EGFR is a prerequisite for degradative receptor sorting	 a process also called receptor downregulation [Sorkin and Goh	 2009]. Cells use EGFR internalization and sorting into a functional degradative pathway in order to attenuate the magnitude and duration of signaling events [Sorkin and Goh	 2009]. Thus	 CBL negatively regulates EGFR-RAS-MAPK signal traffic downstream of EGFR by controlling receptor internalization and degradation.  For the presented report	 our main objectives were to determine the functional consequences of pathogenic CBL mutations affecting evolutionary conserved amino acids on EGFR ubiquitylation and trafficking and to relate these data to RAS-MAPK pathway dysregulation in Noonan syndrome and other RASopathies. Materials and Methods  Plasmids  We used a human wild-type CBL construct (RefSeq: NM_005188.3) as a template and CBL-specific PCR primers to generate a wild-type CBL cDNA amplicon by PCR. Mutant CBL constructs were established by PCR-mediated mutagenesis. Purified PCR amplicons (CBLWT	 CBLC381A	 CBLK382E	 CBLD390Y	 and CBLR420Q) were cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO (Life Technologies	 Darmstadt	 Germany) according to the protocol provided. Constructs were sequenced for integrity and used for the transfer into GATEWAYâ„¢-compatible destination vector pcDNA3-DEST	 following the manufacturer's instructions. Wild-type CBL construct was a gift from Mirko Schmidt (Goethe University School of Medicine	 Frankfurt am Main	 Germany). Wild-type pcDNA3-EGFR construct (RefSeq: NM_005228.3) was a gift of Dr. Sarah J. Parsons (University of Virginia	 Charlottesville	 VA). pRK5-HA-ubiquitin (RefSeq: NM_021009.5) was purchased from Addgene (plasmid 17608). Cell culture and transfection  COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS; PAA Laboratories	 CÃ¶lbe	 Germany) and penicillin-streptomycin (100 U/ml and 100 Î¼g/ml	 respectively; Life Technologies) and incubated at 37Â°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with pcDNA3-DEST-CBL constructs using Lipofectamineâ„¢2000 Reagent (Life Technologies) or TurboFectâ„¢ (Thermo Scientific	 Bonn	 Germany) according to manufacturer's protocols. Immunoblotting  After transfection with expression constructs	 cells were incubated under serum-starved (0.1% FBS) conditions overnight. Next morning	 cells were stimulated with 10 or 20 ng/ml EGF (Sigmaâ€“Aldrich	 Taufkirchen	 Germany) for different times or left untreated. Cells were washed with ice-cold 1Ã— PBS and harvested in modified RIPA (radioimmunoprecipitation assay) buffer (150 mM NaCl	 50 mM Trisâ€“HCl	 pH 8.0	 0.5% sodium desoxycholate [w/v]	 1% Nonidet P40 [v/v]	 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate [w/v]) containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche	 Mannheim	 Germany) and	 if applicable	 phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche) or N-ethylmaleimide (Sigmaâ€“Aldrich). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 21	000 g for 10 min at 4Â°C and protein solutions were supplemented with sample buffer. Proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF (polyvinylidene difluoride) membranes. Following blocking (20 mM Trisâ€“HCl	 pH 7.4; 150 mM NaCl; 0.1% Tween-20; 4% nonfat dry milk) and washing (20 mM Trisâ€“HCl	 pH 7.4; 150 mM NaCl; 0.1% Tween-20) membranes were incubated in primary antibody solution (20 mM Trisâ€“HCl	 pH 7.4; 150 mM NaCl; 0.1% Tween-20; 5% BSA or 0.5% nonfat dry milk) containing the appropriate antibodies. Next	 membranes were washed and incubated with peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody. After final washing	 immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Millipore	 Schwalbach	 Germany). Antibodies and reagents  Following primary antibodies and dilutions were used: rabbit anti-Cbl (C-15	 WB 1:1	000; IF 1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology	 Heidelberg	 Germany); rabbit anti-EGFR (clone 1005	 WB 1:300; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); rat anti-HA-HRP (WB 1:12	000; Roche); rabbit anti-p44/42 MAP kinase (ERK 1/2	 approved protein symbols MAPK3 and MAPK1) antibody (WB 1:1	000; Cell Signaling Technology	 Danvers	 MA)	 rabbit anti-phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase (pERK 1/2) (Thr202/Tyr204) antibody (WB 1:1	000; Cell Signaling Technology)	 mouse anti-Î±-tubulin antibody (clone DM 1A; WB 1:7	500; Sigmaâ€“Aldrich). As secondary antibodies	 horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (1:5	000â€“1:30	000 dilution; GE Healthcare	 Munich	 Germany) were used. Further reagents used are as follows: Cycloheximide (10 Î¼g/ml; Sigmaâ€“Aldrich)	 N-ethylmaleimide (10 mM; Sigmaâ€“Aldrich)	 EGF complexed with Alexa Fluor 488 (100 ng/ml; Life Technologies)	 and unlabelled human EGF (10 ng/ml or 20 ng/ml; Sigmaâ€“Aldrich). High EGF concentrations were chosen because only higher concentrations of EGF (>10 ng/ml) induce nonclathrin-mediated endocytosis (NCE) in addition to clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) [Sigismund et al.	 2008; Sigismund et al.	 2013]. Notably	 EGFR ubiquitylation seems to be indispensable for NCE [Sigismund et al.	 2013]	 but not for CME [Madshus and Stang	 2009; Sorkin and Goh	 2009; Haglund and Dikic	 2012; Sigismund et al.	 2012]. Biotinylation-based EGFR cell surface assay  COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with CBL expression constructs and incubated under serum-starved (0.1% FBS) culture conditions overnight. Next day	 cells were stimulated with starvation medium supplemented with 10 ng/ml EGF for 30 min or left untreated. Subsequently	 cells were transferred on ice and washed three times with ice-cold HBSS (Life Technologies). Next	 cell surface proteins were biotinylated using 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-SS biotin (Thermo Scientific Pierce	 Bonn	 Germany) in HBSS for 15 min at 4Â°C. Unbound biotin was removed by washing twice with ice-cold HBSS containing 5 mM Trisâ€“HCl (pH 7.4) followed by rinsing with PBS. Subsequent to biotinylation	 cells were harvested in ice-cold RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Aliquots of the total cell lysates were kept for immunoblotting and the remaining supernatants were subjected to precipitation with streptavidin agarose (Sigmaâ€“Aldrich) overnight at 4Â°C. Biotin-labeled surface EGFR fractions coupled to agarose beads were collected by centrifugation for 1 min at 8	000 g at 4Â°C	 and agarose pellets were washed twice with ice-cold RIPA buffer. Precipitates and total cell lysates were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels	 transferred to PVDF membranes	 and subjected to immunodetection. Biotinylation-based EGFR internalization assay  COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with CBL expression constructs and incubated under serum-starved (0.1% FBS) culture conditions overnight. Cells were transferred to ice	 rinsed three times with ice-cold HBSS	 and cell surface proteins were biotinylated using 0.5 mg/ml biotin (Thermo Scientific Pierce) in HBSS for 15 min at 4Â°C. Unbound biotin was quenched by washing three times with 5 mM Trisâ€“HCl (pH 7.4) in HBSS. Internalization of biotinylated EGF receptors was induced by stimulation with 10 ng/ml EGF in prewarmed starvation medium (0.1% FBS) for 30 min at 37Â°C. To stop endocytosis and remove remaining cell surface-bound biotin	 cells were transferred on ice and immediately covered and washed with ice-cold glutathione-containing buffer (50 mM glutathione	 1 mM EDTA	 75 mM NaCl	 10% FBS [v/v]	 75 mM NaOH). After washing with ice-cold PBS	 cells were lysed in RIPA buffer; as controls and to demonstrate the efficiency of biotin-stripping	 unstimulated cultures were lysed in RIPA buffer. Biotinylated proteins were precipitated using streptavidin-conjugated agarose beads; intracellular EGFR fractions were collected in the precipitates. After washing precipitates with RIPA buffer	 both total cell lysates and precipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting. EGFR degradation assay  COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with CBL expression constructs and incubated under serum-starved (0.1% FBS) culture conditions overnight. Next day	 cells were incubated with 10 Î¼g/ml cycloheximide in starvation medium for 30 min to block protein synthesis. Then	 parallel cultures were stimulated by incubation in starvation medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml EGF for 60	120	 or 240 min at 37Â°C. As controls	 parallel cultures were harvested without EGF stimulation. Cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and lysed with ice-cold RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl	 1% Nonidet P40 [v/v]	 0.5% sodium deoxycholate [w/v]	 0.1% SDS [w/v]	 50 mM Tris	 pH 8). Finally	 lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Immunocytochemistry  COS-7 cells were cultivated on coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine and transiently transfected with CBL expression constructs. To visualize EGFR localization	 cells were serum-starved overnight and stimulated with 100 ng/ml fluorescently labeled EGF in starvation medium (0.1% FBS) for 30 min. Subsequently	 cells were rinsed with PBS	 fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigmaâ€“Aldrich) in PBS	 and washed three times with PBS. After treatment with permeabilization/blocking solution (2% BSA	 3% goat serum	 0.5% Nonidet P40 in PBS)	 cells were incubated in antibody solution (3% goat serum and 0.1% Nonidet P40 in PBS) containing rabbit anti-Cbl (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) primary antibody. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor Dyes; Life Technologies) in antibody solution. After extensive washing with PBS	 cells were embedded in mounting solution (25% Mowiol 4â€“88 in PBS mixed with 5% propyl gallate in PBS/glycerol in a ratio of 4:1) on microscopic slides. Cells were examined with a Leica DMIRE2 confocal microscope equipped with an HCX PL APO 63Ã—/1.32 oil immersion objective lens. Quantification of EGF488 signals was performed using Image J software. EGFR ubiquitylation assay  COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with CBL expression constructs together with HA-tagged ubiquitin and EGFR expression constructs. Transfected cells were incubated under serum-starved (0.1% FBS) culture conditions overnight. Next day	 cells were stimulated with starvation medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml EGF for 30 min at 37Â°C. Cells were washed with ice-cold 1Ã— PBS and harvested in ice-cold RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail and 10 mM N-ethylmaleimide (Sigmaâ€“Aldrich) to inhibit deubiquitylating enzymes. Next	 the cell debris was removed by centrifugation and aliquots of the total cell lysates were kept for immunoblotting. The remaining supernatants were incubated with 1 Î¼g of anti-EGFR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 hr at 4Â°C	 followed by incubation with protein A-agarose beads (Roche) overnight at 4Â°C. EGFR coupled to agarose beads were collected by centrifugation for 30 sec at 12	000g at 4Â°C	 and agarose pellets were washed three times with ice-cold Triton lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100 [v/v]	 150 mM NaCl	 5 mM EDTA	 50 mM HEPES	 pH 7.5) supplemented with 0.05% (w/v) SDS. Precipitates and total cell lysates were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels	 transferred to PVDF membranes	 and subjected to immunodetection. Scanning densitometry and statistical analysis  Signals on microscopic images and on autoradiographs were quantified by densitometric analysis using the ImageJ software (NIH; http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/index.html). Relative EGF488 and EGFR levels were assessed as described in the figure legends. One-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were used to compare means of all conditions (CBL protein variants) for statistical significance. Means were considered significant different at P value <0.05. Subsequently	 post hoc two-tailed unpaired Student's t-tests were used to determine statistical significance of the difference of the mean values between two conditions each (i.e.	 CBLWT versus CBLC381A	 CBLK382E	 CBLD390Y	 or CBLR420Q). Values are presented as the mean Â± SD and were considered significant different at P value <0.05. Results  CBL missense mutations in patients with Noonan syndrome-like phenotypes affect amino acids within the linker-RING finger domain [Martinelli et al.	 2010; Niemeyer et al.	 2010; Perez et al.	 2010] (Fig. 1A). Since an intact RING finger domain is essential for both ligand-mediated internalization and degradation of the EGFR [Sorkin and Goh	 2009]	 we analyzed functional consequences of three disease-associated CBL amino acid changes within this domain (Fig. 1A).  Figure 1.  Figure 1. Open in figure viewerDownload Powerpoint slide Modular architecture of CBL and consequences of CBL mutants on EGFR surface levels. A: CBL protein domains and motifs. The total number of amino acids (aa) is given. Tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain (aa 47â€“345)	 linker sequence (linker	 aa 346â€“380)	 RING finger domain (RING	 aa 381â€“423)	 proline-rich region (ProR	 aa 481â€“688)	 and ubiquitin-associated domain (UBA	 aa 857â€“894) are schematically shown. Amino acid substitutions analyzed in this study are indicated. B: p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q amino acid changes compromise CBL function during removal of surface EGFR. COS-7 cells transiently expressing the indicated CBL protein variants or transfected with empty vector (mock) were cultured under serum-starved conditions overnight. Next day	 cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml EGF for 30 min (30 min tEGF) at 37Â°C or left untreated (0 min tEGF). Subsequently	 surface proteins were biotinylated at 4Â°C and precipitated from cell extracts by using streptavidin-conjugated agarose beads. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-EGFR antibodies. Representative autoradiographs show EGFR levels in total cell lysates (tcl) and precipitates (pcpt). Expression of CBL protein variants in total cell lysates was monitored by immunoblotting using anti-CBL antibodies and anti-tubulin antibodies were used to control for equal loading. C: Densities of autoradiographic signals obtained from experiments as described in (B) were quantified by scanning densitometry. Amounts of surface EGFR (i.e.	 precipitated EGFR) was normalized to total EGFR and considered as 100% for unstimulated parallel cultures (0 min tEGF). Thus	 surface EGFR upon EGF stimulation (30 min tEGF) is expressed as percentage of surface EGFR in unstimulated cells. Data represent the mean of n independent experiments Â± SD. One-way ANOVA between groups: P > 0.05 (not significant). Post hoc testing was not performed. CBL amino acid changes p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q alter cellular EGFR distribution  If CBL mutations interfere with EGFR internalization	 the amount of surface and intracellular EGFR should be altered in cells expressing mutant CBL proteins. Therefore	 we determined the level of surface and intracellular EGFR in cells stimulated with EGF for 30 min by using surface biotinylation-based assays. Expression of CBLWT resulted in a clear reduction of surface EGFR upon EGF stimulation (Fig. 1B	 CBLWT	 precipitates	 30 min) relative to unstimulated cells (Fig. 1B	 CBLWT	 precipitates	 0 min). In contrast	 transfection of cells with CBL mutants (Fig. 1B; CBLK382E	 CBLD390Y	 or CBLR420Q) or with empty vector (Fig. 1B	 mock) did not induce marked alterations of surface EGFR levels (Fig. 1B	 compare precipitates for 0 and 30 min each). In line with this	 CBLC381A	 a RING finger mutant (Fig. 1A) that has already been shown to perturb EGFR internalization [Waterman et al.	 1999; Thien et al.	 2001] and that we used as an internal control	 also did not stimulate removal of surface EGFR (Fig. 1B). Densitometric measurements and statistical analysis revealed that only 55.6% of initial EGFR (unstimulated cells) remained at the surface of cells ectopically expressing CBLWT; however	 cells expressing mutant CBL variants or mock-transfected cells displayed between 73.8% and 88.1% of initial EGFR at the cell surface after 30-min EGF treatment (Fig. 1C). Thus	 CBLWT may promote EGF-induced EGFR internalization	 whereas mutations associated with Noonan syndrome-like phenotypes (p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q) as well as the established RING finger mutation p.C381A may compromise this CBL effect. Even though differences of mean values did not reach statistical significance in these experiments by using one-way ANOVA (data not shown)	 a tendency for impaired removal of surface EGFR caused by CBL mutations is obvious. Indeed	 we could substantiate our results by the determination of the amounts of intracellular EGFR after ligand stimulation. CBLWT overexpression resulted in a marked enrichment of the intracellular EGFR fraction upon 30-min EGF treatment (Fig. 2A	 blots on the left-hand side	 precipitates	 30 min) indicating efficient ligand-induced EGFR internalization. Cells expressing any of the tested CBL mutants (CBLK382E	 CBLD390Y	 CBLR420Q	 or CBLC381A) showed slightly decreased levels of intracellular EGFR relative to CBLWT-expressing cells (Fig. 2A	 autoradiographs on the left-hand side	 precipitates	 30 min). Mock-transfected cells also showed reduced amounts of internalized EGFR compared to CBLWT-expressing cells (Fig. 2A	 autoradiographs on the right-hand side	 precipitates; [note: all bands on these autoradiographs represent results after 30-min EGF stimulation]). On the other hand	 CBL mutants seemed to have even less intracellular EGFR upon 30-min EGF stimulation than mock-transfected cells (Fig. 2A	 autoradiographs on the right-hand side	 precipitates). By densitometric measurements and statistical analysis of several independent experiments	 we could prove that expression of mutant CBL variants resulted in significantly decreased ligand-induced internalization of EGFR compared to CBLWT-expressing cells by about 25%â€“33% (Fig. 2B). These data suggest loss-of-function consequences of disease-associated CBL amino acid changes. Interestingly	 mock transfection led to intermediate amounts of intracellular EGFR	 minus 15% compared to CBLWT but about plus 15% compared to CBL mutants (Fig. 2B)	 which may indicate that CBL mutations exert additional dominant-negative effects on EGFR internalization. To confirm our observations by microscopic analysis	 we stimulated COS-7 cells with fluorescently labeled EGF (EGF488) for 30 min (Fig. 3). For these analyses	 we used anti-CBL antibodies	 which recognize ectopically expressed as well as endogenous CBL protein; thus	 untransfected cells and cells expressing very low levels of CBL protein variants cannot be differentiated and both are considered as control cells. Strong expression of CBLWT resulted in increased intracellular EGF488 compared to control cells on the same specimen (Fig. 3A). In contrast	 cells strongly expressing CBLK382E	 CBLD390Y	 CBLR420Q	 or CBLC381A showed reduced amounts of intracellular EGF488 when compared to control cells on the respective same specimen (Fig. 3A). We validated these observations by quantification	 normalization	 and statistical evaluation of immuncytochemical specimens: although expression of CBLWT strongly increased intracellular EGF488 levels	 expression of any CBL mutant decreased the amount of intracellular EGF488 (Fig. 3B). Taken together	 our data demonstrate that CBL amino acid changes p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q alter the cellular distribution of EGFR and we suggest that impaired EGFR internalization underlies this defect.

A: COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with CBL expression constructs or with empty vector (mock) as indicated and cultured under serum-starved conditions overnight. Next day	 surface proteins were biotinylated at 4Â°C and	 subsequently	 stimulated with 10 ng/ml EGF for 30 min (30 min tEGF) at 37Â°C or left untreated (0 min tEGF). Cells were transferred on ice	 remaining cell surface bound biotin was removed	 and cells were harvested. Internalized biotinylated proteins were precipitated with streptavidin-conjugated agarose and samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. To represent each CBL protein variant at least once	 autoradiographs from two different experiments are shown. To demonstrate the efficiency of biotin stripping	 the autoradiographs on the left-hand side also show the levels of precipitated EGFR in unstimulated (0 min tEGF) cells. EGFR levels in total cell lysates (tcl) and precipitates (pcpt) were determined using anti-EGFR antibodies	 expression of CBL protein variants in total cell lysates was monitored by using anti-CBL antibodies	 and anti-tubulin antibodies were used to control for equal loading.

CBL amino acid changes p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q impair CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitylation and abrogate the stimulating effect of CBL on EGFR degradation  The CBL RING finger domain is central to the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity [Zheng et al.	 2000]	 and CBL-mediated ubiquitylation strongly affects the postendocytic EGFR fate by lysosomal targeting and subsequent degradation of ubiquitylated receptors [Swaminathan and Tsygankov	 2006; Sorkin and Goh	 2009]. First	 we monitored the capacity of wild-type and mutant CBL proteins to ubiquitylate EGFR upon 30-min EGF stimulation by using precipitation-based ubiquitylation assays. Overexpression of CBLWT resulted in a strong ubiquitylation signal in EGFR precipitates (Fig. 4A	 top panel; CBLWT) relative to mock-transfected cells (Fig. 4A	 top panel; mock). In contrast	 transfection of cells with CBL mutants associated with Noonan-like phenotypes did not result in augmented EGFR ubiquitylation (Fig. 4A	 top panel; CBLK382E	 CBLD390Y	 or CBLR420Q). Similarly	 cells expressing ubiquitylation-deficient CBLC381A [Waterman et al.	 1999; Thien et al.	 2001] showed slightly lower levels of ubiquitylated EGFR than CBLWT cells (Fig. 4A	 top panel; CBLC381A and CBLWT). Perfectly in line with the function of ubiquitin-labeling as a trigger for degradation [Swaminathan and Tsygankov	 2006; Sorkin and Goh	 2009]	 the total amount of EGFR in cells expressing CBLWT was markedly decreased (Fig. 4A	 second and third panel). These representative data from one out of three independent experiments strongly indicate that disease-associated CBL amino acid changes p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q abrogate CBL ubiquitin ligase activity. To measure the impact of CBL mutations on EGFR degradation	 we determined the amounts of total EGFR upon 60	120	 and 240 min of EGF stimulation. Ectopic expression of CBLWT induced a rapid loss of cellular EGFR within 60 min of EGF stimulation followed by constant EGFR levels over the rest of the observation period (Fig. 4B); this indicates that EGFR is subject to effective degradation. In contrast	 in cells transfected with empty vector	 EGFR levels slowly decreased over the time	 starting with a slight reduction of EGFR at 60 min to a marked loss at 240 min of EGF treatment (Fig. 4B). Cells expressing CBLK382E	 CBLD390Y	 or CBLR420Q showed very similar EGFR degradation kinetics to that of mock-transfected cells (Fig. 4B)	 which indicates loss of the stimulating effect of CBL on EGFR degradation. Interestingly	 it seemed that expression of CBLC381A most effectively blocks EGFR degradation (Fig. 4B). We verified these observations by densitometric measurements and statistical analysis of several independent experiments (Fig. 4C): CBLWT induced a reduction to 30.8% of initial EGFR after 60-min EGF stimulation	 whereas mock transfection or expression of CBLK382E	 CBLD390Y	 or CBLR420Q resulted in a decrease to 69.0%	68.80%	74.90%	 and 64.2% of initial EGFR	 respectively (Fig. 4C). These data demonstrate that the promoting effect of CBLWT on EGFR degradation is impaired by disease-associated mutations p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q. Notably	 the control mutant CBLC381A strongly delayed EGFR degradation with only 20% of initial EGFR amounts having been degraded at 240 min upon EGF treatment (Fig. 4C). This may indicate additional negative consequences of the p.C381A change on EGFR trafficking.  Figure 4.  Figure 4.

COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with CBL expression constructs (as indicated) or with empty vector (mock) together with HA-tagged ubiquitin and EGFR expression constructs. Subsequent to incubation under serum-starved culture conditions overnight	 cells were stimulated with 20 ng/ml EGF for 30 min (tEGF) and harvested in ice-cold RIPA buffer containing 10 mM N-ethylmaleimide to inhibit deubiquitylating enzymes.

Levels of ubiquitylated EGFR in precipitates (ip) were monitored by using anti-HA antibodies.

Cell extracts (tcl) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-EGFR antibodies. Anti-tubulin antibodies were used to control for equal loading	 and the expression of CBL protein variants in total cell lysates was monitored by using anti-CBL antibodies; note that the gradually reduction of CBL protein expression after EGF treatment has been reported previously [Schmidt et al.	 2006]. C: Autoradiographic signals obtained from experiments as described in (B) were quantified by scanning densitometry. Amounts of EGFR in unstimulated cells (0 min tEGF) were considered as 100% and EGFR levels upon EGF stimulation (60	120	 and 240 min tEGF) are expressed as percentage of EGFR in unstimulated cells (0 min tEGF).

Post hoc P values were calculated by unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01. Disease-associated mutations disrupt the ability of CBL to attenuate RAS-MAPK signaling  RASopathies are caused by hyperstimulation of RAS-MAPK signaling cascades [Aoki et al.	 2008]. Therefore	 by measuring ERK phosphorylation levels in COS-7 cells	 we determined activation of ERK proteins	 which are well-defined key players in RAS-MAPK signaling [Dhillon et al.	 2007]. We documented a time course for ERK phosphorylation upon EGF stimulation and we found no statistically significant differences after 10- and 30-min EGF stimulation between cells expressing CBLWT and either cells expressing disease-associated CBL protein variant or mock-transfected cells (Fig. 5A and B). At 60 min upon EGF stimulation	 cells expressing CBLWT showed reduced ERK1/2 phosphorylation compared with mock-transfected cells; however	 cells expressing CBLC381A	 CBLK382E	 CBLD390Y	 or CBLR420Q did not (Fig. 5A and B). In fact	 phospho-ERK1/2 levels were significantly increased in CBLC381A	 CBLK382E	 CBLD390Y	 or CBLR420Q cells relative to CBLWT-expressing cells at 60 min upon EGF stimulation (Fig. 5A and B). Quantification revealed between 1.43-fold and 2.24-fold higher ERK phosphorylation levels in cells expressing CBL mutant proteins or in mock-transfected cells than in CBLWT-expressing cells (Fig. 5B). We conclude that amino acid changes p.C381A	 p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q abrogate the potential of CBL to attenuate RAS-MAPK signaling.  Figure 5.  Figure 5.

B: Autoradiographic signals obtained from experiments as described in (A) were quantified by scanning densitometry.

Discussion  Here	 we provide evidence that dysfunction of EGFR trafficking contributes to a clinically variable condition out of RASopathy-spectrum disorders. Defective endocytic sorting of receptors has been already proposed as a pathomechanistic basis for Noonan syndrome related phenotypes [Martinelli et al.	 2010]. By detailed analyses	 we could now demonstrate that RASopathy-associated amino acid changes p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q in the CBL RING domain (i) derange the cellular distribution of EGFR	 (ii) interfere with CBL-mediated ubiquitylation of EGFR	 (iii) abrogate the stimulating effect of CBL on EGFR degradation	 and (iv) disrupt CBL-mediated downregulation of RAS-MAPK signaling.  EGFR is internalized through different mechanisms: non-clathrin-mediated endocytosis (NCE) and clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) [Sorkin and Goh	 2009]. EGFR ubiquitylation seems to be indispensable for NCE [Sigismund et al.	 2013]	 whereas the need of EGFR ubiquitylation for CME is discussed controversially [Madshus and Stang	 2009; Sorkin and Goh	 2009; Haglund and Dikic	 2012; Sigismund et al.	 2012]. In line with our data on CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitylation (Fig. 4A)	 recently it has been reported that the disease-associated CBL amino acid changes p.D390Y and p.R420Q result in impaired EGFR ubiquitylation in response to EGF stimulation [Martinelli et al.	 2010]; this indicates loss-of-function consequences regarding the CBL ubiquitin ligase capacity. Several reports have shown that an intact CBL linker-RING domain is essential for EGF/EGFR internalization [e.g.	 Waterman et al.	 1999; Thien et al.	 2001; Jiang and Sorkin	 2003]. Taken together	 we suggest that RASopathy-associated amino acid changes	 which disrupt the ability of CBL to ubiquitylate EGFR	 compromise EGFR internalization and	 therefore	 result in higher amounts of surface and lower amounts of intracellular EGFR (Figs. 1B and C and 2). Notably	 intracellular EGFR levels in mock-transfected cells	 which lie between those in wild-type and mutant CBL-expressing cells (Fig. 2)	 may indicate a dominant-negative effect of CBL changes p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q on EGFR internalization. Accordingly	 dominant-negative effects of myeloid neoplasm-associated CBL missense mutations (p.Q367P	 p.Y371 S	 and p.R420Q) on CBL ubiquitin ligase function and receptor endocytosis have been demonstrated [Sargin et al.	 2007; Sanada et al.	 2009]. Dominant-negative consequences could be explained by competitive binding of mutant and wild-type CBL alleles to phosphotyrosine-containing motifs of activated EGFR in the combination with the inability of mutant CBL to recruit E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes to the RING domain. This	 however	 remains to be proved.  EGFR ubiquitylation is largely devoted to commit EGFR to lysosomal degradation [Haglund and Dikic	 2012]. In line with this	 we detected rapid and efficient EGFR degradation upon ectopic expression of CBLWT	 but not in cells expressing mutant CBL protein variants (Fig. 4A and B). Since all tested RASopathy-associated CBL variants and mock-transfection caused very similar degradation kinetics	 we suggest loss-of-function consequences of p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q on EGFR degradation. Interestingly	 the p.C381A mutation strongly delayed and blocked EGFR degradation. Cysteine 381 is a key residue for the binding of zinc	 an important cofactor for stabilizing the RING domain; mutations may disrupt zinc-chelating loops that accommodate significant contact with E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes [Zheng et al.	 2000]. However	 at the moment there is no valid mechanistic explanation for differing functional consequences of the p.C381A change and the RASopathy-associated mutations	 because all of these affect amino acids that seem to be essential for the formation of the binding interface for E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes [Zheng et al.	 2000; Martinelli et al.	 2010].  Noonan syndrome and related disorders are associated with dysregulated RAF-MAPK signal transduction [Schubbert et al.	 2007]. In cells expressing mutant CBL	 we detected ERK phosphorylation levels that were stronger than in CBLWT cells but similar to control cells (Fig. 5) indicating a loss of the ability to attenuate RAS-MAPK signaling. Thus	 this loss-of-function effect of RASopathy-associated CBL mutants is transformed into a gain of RAS-MAPK signaling. We conclude that inefficient degradation and affected internalization of EGFR (and possibly other CBL-regulated cell surface receptors) finally result in pronounced ligand-induced signaling events such as increased RAS-MAPK signal flux. This interrelation is well known from the pathogenesis of malignancies: enhanced RAS-MAPK signaling is common to human cancer and activating somatic mutations have been described in various genes encoding proteins of these signaling pathways [Dhillon et al.	 2007]; in addition	 somatic mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in the downregulation of receptors upstream of the RAS-MAPK signaling highway (e.g.	 CBL	 HIP1	 and TSG101) have been linked to malignancies [Bache et al.	 2004]. Consistently	 malfunction of the trafficking machinery inhibits either the early phase of receptor internalization or the transport of internalized receptor complexes toward degradation	 both of which promote the development of cancer [Dikic and Schmidt	 2007]. Taken together	 we suggest that RASopathy-associated lesions affect CBL binding with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes	 which results in loss of CBL ubiquitylation capacity and defective trafficking of EGFR (and other CBL-regulated cell surface receptors); this then again prolongs the availability of activated surface receptors in the cell	 which finally is transformed into increased RAS-MAPK signaling.  Germline CBL mutations are associated with a strikingly variable phenotype [Martinelli et al.	 2010; Niemeyer et al.	 2010; Perez et al.	 2010]	 as this is generally the case for Noonan syndrome and related disorders [Allanson et al.	 2010; Roberts et al.	 2013]. Modifier genes may explain these inter- and intragenic differences in disease expression indicating that these monogenic diseases rather are Mendelian disorders [Nadeau	 2001; Slavotinek and Biesecker	 2003; Genin et al.	 2008]. Since all the genes implicated in Noonan syndrome encode proteins integral to the EGFR-RAS-MAPK pathway	 phenocritical genetic modifiers may include genes involved in this signaling network. Remarkably	 Noonan syndrome and related disorders are caused by mutations in genes encoding more proximal components of RAS-MAPK signaling	 for example	 PTPN11 and SOS1	 whereas other RASopathies	 the cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome and Costello syndrome	 are associated with lesions in downstream components of RAS-MAPK cascades [Aoki et al.	 2008]. Therefore	 for Noonan syndrome it was proposed that in addition to RAS-MAPK signaling other downstream pathways could be affected	 which may account for the marked phenotypic variability [Roberts et al.	 2007]. Accordingly	 the position of CBL as the most upstream regulator of RAS-MAPK signaling associated with RASopathies by now may functionally explain the extreme clinical variability of patients with CBL germline mutations	 which has been reported recently [Martinelli et al.	 2010]. In this respect	 by describing a further regulatory level in the RASopathy network	 namely	 the trafficking of growth factor receptors upstream of RAS-MAPK signaling	 we underline the growing functional variability of RASopathy-associated gene lesions. Thereby	 we add important novel aspects to the knowledge of the pathophysiological basis of RASopathies	 which markedly expands the number of possible functional candidate genes for RAS-MAPK pathway associated diseases: mutations in genes coding for proteins that regulate trafficking of EGFR and other receptors upstream of RAS-MAPK signaling may account for genetically yet unclarified cases of RASopathies. This knowledge may facilitate the evaluation of genomic variants in exome data from mutation-negative patients with RASopathies and may open new pharmacogenomic approaches to rescue hyperstimulation of RAS-MAPK cascades. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML)	 mutational activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) Flt3 is frequently involved in leukemic transformation. However	 little is known about a possible role of highly expressed wild-type Flt3 in AML. The protooncogene c-Cbl is an important regulator of RTK signaling	 acting through its ubiquitin ligase activity and as a platform for several signaling adaptor molecules. Here	 we analyzed the role of c-Cbl in Flt3 signal transduction and myeloid transformation. C-Cbl physically interacted with Flt3 and was tyrosine phosphorylated in the presence of Flt3-ligand (FL). Overexpression of a dominant-negative form of c-Cbl (Cbl-70Z) inhibited FL-induced Flt3 ubiquitylation and internalization	 indicating involvement of c-Cbl in Flt3 signaling. DNA sequencing of AML bone marrow revealed a case with a c-Cbl point mutation (Cbl-R420Q). CblR420Qinhibited Flt3internalization and ubiquitylation. Coexpression of Cbl-R420Q or Cbl- 70Z with Flt3 induced cytokine-independent growth and survival of 32Dcl3 cells in the absence of FL. Also	 the mutant Cbl proteins altered the amplitude and duration of Flt3- dependent signaling events. Our results indicate an important role of Cbl proteins in Flt3 signal modulation. Also	 the data suggest a novel mechanism of leukemic transformation in AML by mutational inactivation of negative RTK regulators. (Blood. 2007; 110:1004-1012) Â© 2007 by The American Society of Hematology Introduction Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) bind extracellular growth factors and activate intracellular signaling networks. The magnitude and kinetics of RTKs activation are tightly regulated	 since they determine the quality and extent of the biologic response.1 Attenuation of RTK signaling occurs by endocytosis and subsequent protein degradation.2-4 Cbl proteins have been shown to be central players in these processes.5-7 The members of the Cbl family	 c-Cbl	 Cbl-b	 and Cbl-3	 contain an N-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain that allows direct interaction with activated RTKs	 and a RING finger domain that classifies Cbl proteins as E3 ubiquitin ligases.5	8-10 Ubiquitylation of RTKs is important for their internalization	 endocytic sorting	 and targeting for degradation.2 In addition to their ubiquitin E3 ligase activity	 Cbl proteins also associate with the endocytic machinery via their C-terminus by recruiting proteins such as CIN85 and endophilins.11	12 However	 not only are Cbl proteins important for RTK signal termination	 but they also mediate positive RTK signaling events to downstream effectors. Upon phosphorylation	 Cbl molecules bind signaling molecules including SHP-2	 Gab2	 and PI3-kinase.13 In animal models	 but not in human cancers	 oncogenic forms of Cbl have been described that are characterized by loss of the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity.14	15 It has been reported that these oncogenic mutants of Cbl interact with activated RTKs and function in a dominant-negative fashion.16	17 Aberrant signaling by the type III RTK Flt3 is an important event in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Flt3 strongly influences hematopoietic progenitor cell homeostasis and is highly expressed in AML.18-21 Also	 about one third of AML cases harbor somatic	 activating Flt3 mutations that cause myeloid transformation.21-24 In contrast to activating mutations	 little is known about the potential functions of Flt3 in AML cases lacking Flt3 mutations. Also	 the mechanisms of Flt3 signal regulation and the role of Cbl proteins in these processes remain undetermined	 although it has been shown that Flt3 activation is followed by Cbl phosphorylation.25 Here	 we analyzed the role of c-Cbl in the internalization	 ubiquitylation	 and biologic functions of wild-type Flt3 (Flt3-WT) and the most commonly described Flt3 mutations in AML	 internal tandem duplication (Flt3-ITD). We found that the inhibition of Cbl function severely disturbed Flt3 signal transduction kinetics by blocking Flt3 internalization and ubiquitylation. As a consequence	 interference with Cbl function induced ligand-independent	 autoactive biologic effects of Flt3. Also	 we describe a novel E3-ligase inactivating c-Cbl mutation isolated from the blasts of one AML patient. This mutant Cbl protein interfered with the function of endogenous c-Cbl and displayed in vitro transforming activity in myeloid cells that was dependent on the presence of Flt3. To our knowledge	 this represents the first case of a transforming Cbl mutation in a human cancer specimen	 pointing toward a novel mechanism of disturbed RTK signal termination in human cancers that could be amenable to pharmacological kinase inhibition.

Cell lines The IL-3â€“dependent murine myeloid cell line 32Dcl3 (subsequently referred to as 32D) was kindly provided by Dr Felicitas Rosenthal (Freiburg	 Germany) and was cultured as described.23	26 COS-7 and 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (Invitrogen	 Karlsruhe	 Germany). Cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37Â°C and 5% CO2. Generation of stable cell lines The generation of 32D cells stably expressing wild-type Flt3 or Flt3-ITD has been previously described.23	24 For generating Cbl-overexpressing 32D cell lines	 parental 32D or 32D cells stably expressing Flt3 receptors were electroporated with different Cbl constructs (c-Cbl-WT	 Cbl-70Z	 CblR420Q)	 as described.23 The stable Cbl-expressing bulk cultures were selected using neomycin (800  g/mL). To avoid possible clonal selection	 for each cell line	 at least 2 bulk cultures were generated. All cell lines were generated and maintained in medium supplemented with WEHIconditioned medium as source of IL-3 until being used for the experiments. Transient transfections For transient expression experiments	 COS-7 cells were transfected using SuperFect (QIAGEN	 Hilden	 Germany) according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. At 48 hours after transfection	 cells were lysed and analyzed for expression of indicated proteins. Patient samples The patient samples were collected from patients enrolled in a treatment optimization trial in Germany.27 Control total bone marrow samples were obtained from healthy donors. Written informed consent was obtained from all individuals in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The use of human material for scientific purposes was approved by the ethics committees of the Medical Faculty of MuÂ¨nster University	 Goethe University Medical School	 and the Technical University of Munich. RNA isolation	 cDNA preparation	 and sequencing RNA was isolated from AML blasts using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen	 San Diego	 CA). A total of 1  g RNA from each sample was reverse-transcribed using oligo-d(T) primer and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Clontech	 Palo Alto	 CA). DNA generated by reversetranscriptionâ€“polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was amplified with the sense primer 5-CCTGGCTACATGGCTTTTTTG-3 and the antisense primer 5-GTCAAGTCGTGGTGGCACC-3	 yielding a 708-bp PCR product corresponding to nucleotides 796 to 1503 of the published sequence of human c-Cbl. An ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator kit (Applied Biosystems	 Darmstadt	 Germany) was used according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. A standard cycle sequencing protocol with Taq polymerase was performed and analyzed on an automated sequencing system (ABI Prism 3700; Perkin Elmer	 Shelton	 CT). For direct sequencing of the PCR products	 the PCR primers were used. Immunoprecipitations and Western blot analyses COS-7 or 32D cells transfected with Flt3 and Cbl constructs were washed twice with PBS and starved overnight in medium containing 0.5% FCS and were then stimulated for 10 minutes at 37Â°C with either 40 ng/mL FL or 1 ng/mL IL-3. Flt3 immunoprecipitations were performed as described.23	26 For the immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged proteins	 cell lysates were incubated overnight with an anti-HA antibody conjugated affinity matrix (Roche	 Mannheim	 Germany). The immunoprecipitates were washed 4 times with lysis buffer	 resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfateâ€“polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)	 and probed with the indicated antibodies overnight at 4Â°C. Lysate preparation and Western blot analyses were performed as described earlier.23	26 GST pull-down and Far Western assays 293T cells were transfected with the indicated constructs and lysed 48 hours after transfection. For GST pull-down assays	 lysates were incubated overnight with equal amounts of either GST alone	 GST-Cbl-PTB	 or GST-Cbl-PTB-G306E coupled to sepharose beads. The beads were subsequently washed 5 times with lysis buffer and the precipitated proteins were then subsequently resolved by SDS-PAGE. After transfer to a PVDF membrane	 the membrane was probed for Flt3 and signals were detected by Western blot. For Far Western analyses	 lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and the proteins transferred to PVDF. The membranes were then incubated overnight with TBS buffer (150 mM NaCl	 10 mM Tris-HCl	 pH 8.0) containing 5% BSA and then incubated for 2 hours at room temperature	 with purified GST-Cbl-PTB in TBS-T buffer (TBS buffer containing 0.05% Tween-20) containing 2 mM Ca2Cl	 at a final concentration of 1  g/mL. After washing the membrane 3 times with TBS-T buffer	 the GST fusion proteins were detected by Western blotting using anti-GST antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Flt3 protein half-life degradation analyses 32D cells expressing the indicated Flt3 proteins were cytokine deprived overnight in medium containing 0.5% FCS. Subsequently	 cells were then exposed to 50  g/mL cycloheximide for 2 hours at 37Â°C. Cells were then incubated with 100 ng/mL FL at 37Â°C. The experiment was stopped by cell lysis at the indicated time points. For densitometry	 blots were scanned and the bands were quantified using the GelPro Analyser software (INTAS	 GoÂ¨ttingen	 Germany) according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Analysis of cell growth The 32D cells expressing Flt3 or Cbl constructs were washed twice and resuspended in RPMI 1640 with 10% FCS alone or supplemented with the indicated growth factors at a concentration of 2  105 cells/mL. Viable cells	 determined by trypan blue exclusion	 were counted daily until day 4. [3H]-thymidine incorporation assays were performed as described previously.23 Experiments were repeated at least 3 times. Each data point represents the mean plus or minus standard deviation of 3 wells. Site-directed mutagenesis Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuickChange sitedirected mutagenesis kit (Stratagene	 Amsterdam	 the Netherlands) according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. To construct Cbl-R420Q	 the point mutation was introduced in the c-Cbl cDNA. For generating kinasedeficient Flt3 (Flt3-K644A)	 lysine 644 of Flt3-WT was replaced with alanine. Both mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Internalization assays A total of 5  105 32D cells expressing HA-tagged Flt3 alone or in combination with the indicated Cbl constructs were incubated with FL for the indicated time points. Internalization of the receptor was stopped by BLOOD	 1 AUGUST 2007   VOLUME 110	 NUMBER 3 ROLE OF CBL MUTATIONS IN MYELOID TRANSFORMATION 1005 From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 26	 2017.

After washing	 the cells were incubated with a PE-labeled anti-HA antibody for 30 minutes at 4Â°C. The mean fluorescence intensity of the stained cells was analyzed by flow cytometry using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences	 Palo Alto	 CA). For ligand-binding assays of the EGFR and PDGFR	 CHO cells were transfected with EGFR or PDGFR and c-Cbl-WT	 Cbl-R420Q	 or Cbl-70Z or with GFP as a control. After 48 hours	 cells were serum deprived for 6 hours and receptor internalization was induced with 50 ng/mL EGF/PDGF for the indicated times. Cells were transferred on ice and washed with PBS plus 0.1% BSA (pH 3.4) to remove surface-bound EGF/PDGF. Receptors remaining at the cell surface were labeled with 1 ng/mL [125I]-EGF or [125I]-PDGF for 1.5 hours. After rigid washing for 5 times	 cells were lysed and analyzed in a gamma counter (1470 Wizard; Perkin Elmer). Each time point was measured in triplicate and receptor down-regulation was determined by comparison with the EGFR/PDGFR level on the surface of nonstimulated cells. In vitro ubiquitylation 293T cells were transfected with HA-tagged Flt3 and lysed as described in â€˜â€˜Immunoprecipitations and Western blot analyses.â€™â€™ HA-tagged Flt3 was then immunoprecipitated	 extensively washed with lysis buffer	 and washed 3 times with ubiquitylation buffer (UB) containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)	 2.5 mM Mg2Cl	 and 1 mM DTT. Immunoprecipitated HA-Flt3 (10  g) was diluted in UB buffer with 25  M His-Ub	 100 nM E1 enzyme (Boston Biochem	 Cambridge	 MA)	 500 nM E2 enzyme (Boston Biochem)	 4 mM ATP	 2  g of either purified GST-Cbl-RING	 GST-Cbl-70Z-RING	 or GST-Cbl-R420Q-RING	 in a final volume of 25  L. The reaction mixture was incubated at 30Â°C for 4 hours and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Results Cbl associates with and is phosphorylated by Flt3 In order to analyze the effects of Cbl on Flt3 signal mitigation	 we generated 32D cell lines that stably overexpressed Flt3 together with c-Cbl or a published dominant-negative version of c-Cbl	 Cbl-70Z.15	28 First	 we analyzed whether ligand-induced Flt3 activation led to enhanced phosphorylation of c-Cbl. As shown in Figure 1A	 Flt3 activation led to marked enhancement of c-Cbl phosphorylation	 regardless of activation of Flt3 by mutation or Flt3 ligand (FL)	 while the dominant-negative c-Cbl mutant was significantly phosphorylated even in the absence of exogenously added FL. Next	 we analyzed whether c-Cbl interacted with Flt3-WT and Flt3-ITD. Western blot analyses of Flt3 immunoprecipitates revealed the physical association of c-Cbl with both receptor types (Figure 1B). Furthermore	 immunoprecipitation of exogenously overexpressed	 hemagglutinin (HA)â€“tagged c-Cbl constructs with anti-HA antibodies resulted in immunocomplexes that contained Flt3 (Figure 1C). The association of c-Cbl with Flt3-WT was apparently enhanced by the presence of FL	 whereas Cbl-70Z	 a dominant-negative form	 strongly associated with Flt3 receptors even in the absence of FL. We then analyzed whether Flt3 could directly interact with c-Cbl in vitro. GST pull-down experiments revealed that the Cbl phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain associated with exogenously overexpressed Flt3 from cellular lysates (Figure 1D). A mutation that is known to interfere with the function of the Cbl-PTB domain (G306E) strongly inhibited its association with Flt3 (Figure 1D). By Far Western blot experiments	 we readily detected the association of immunoprecipitated Flt3 separated by SDS-PAGE with purified GST-Cbl-PTB fusion proteins	 indicating the direct nature of the interaction (Figure 1E). Figure 1. Flt3 phosphorylates and physically interacts with c-Cbl. (A) c-Cbl is phosphorylated upon Flt3 activation. The 32D-Flt3-WT or 32D-Flt3-ITD cells stably transfected with HA-tagged Cbl-WT or Cbl-70Z were starved from IL-3 for 12 hours	 and were subsequently exposed to Flt3-ligand (FL) for 10 minutes where indicated. Cbl proteins were immunoprecipitated by anti-HA antibodies and immunoprecipitates were resolved on SDS-PAGE. The phosphorylation of c-Cbl was analyzed using a phosphotyrosine-specific antibody (4G10) and the amount of total immunoprecipitated c-Cbl was analyzed by reprobing the membranes with an anti-HA antibody. (B-C) Flt3 physically interacts with c-Cbl. 32D-Flt3-WT or 32D-Flt3-ITD cells expressing endogenous c-Cbl were starved overnight (B). The next day	 cells were exposed to FL as indicated. Flt3 was immunoprecipitated using anti-Flt3 antibody (as control rabbit IgG was used). Coimmunoprecipitation of Cbl was analyzed using anti-Cbl antibody. (C) 32D-Flt3-WT or 32D-Flt3-ITD cells were stably transfected with HA-tagged c-Cbl or Cbl-70Z. Cells were treated as in panel B. Cbl was immunoprecipitated using anti-HA antibody (as control mouse IgG was used). Coimmunoprecipitation of Flt3 was analyzed using anti-Flt3 antibodies. (D-E) Cbl phosphotyrosinebinding (PTB) domain interacts with Flt3-WT in vitro. (D) 293T cells were transfected with Flt3-WT and lysed after 48 hours. The lysates were incubated with the indicated GST-fusion constructs coupled to sepharose beads. The precipitated proteins were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-Flt3 antibodies. Equal loading of the GST-fusion proteins was confirmed by staining the membranes with Ponceau S. (E) Cell lysates prepared from 293T cells transfected with the indicated plasmid constructs were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes. The membranes were then incubated with purified GST-Cbl-PTB fusion protein and the binding of GST-fusion proteins was detected with anti-GST antibodies. EGFR was used as positive control. 1006 SARGIN et al BLOOD	 1 AUGUST 2007   VOLUME 110	 NUMBER 3 From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 26	 2017. For personal use only. These data show that activated Flt3 physically associates with c-Cbl and induces its phosphorylation. Interestingly	 Cbl-70Z associated strongly with Flt3 receptors and was significantly phosphorylated in Flt3-WTâ€“expressing cells even in the absence of FL. Cbl facilitates ubiquitylation of Flt3-WT and Flt3-ITD Under physiological conditions	 activation of RTKs induces receptor internalization and degradation that are important for RTK signal mitigation. Cbl proteins play an important role in these processes.5-7 Thus	 we examined whether these mechanisms were intact for constitutively active Flt3-ITD and whether they involved Cbl function. We analyzed the degradation of Flt3-WT and Flt3-ITD in cycloheximide-pretreated cells in the presence or absence of Flt3 ligand (Figure 2A). Previously	 it has been shown that Flt3 migrates in SDS-PAGE as 2 bands that differ in their glycosylation pattern.23	26 These bands correspond to an immature intracellular receptor of 130 kDa and the maturely glycosylated receptor of 155 kDa on the cell surface. Recently	 it has been shown that intracellular activation of Flt3-ITD in the endoplasmic reticulum delayed exit of the receptor from the ER.29 As shown in Figure 2A	 degradation of the mature form of Flt3-ITD protein was slightly enhanced	 if compared with wild-type Flt3. However	 our results indicate that degradation of the intracellular form of Flt3-ITD	 but not of Flt3-WT	 occurred slower than degradation of the presumably cell-surface localized receptors (Figure 2A). Next	 we analyzed whether Cbl proteins are involved in Flt3 ubiquitylation (Figure 2B). For this purpose	 HA-tagged ubiquitin was coexpressed with Flt3-WT or Flt3-ITD in COS-7 cells. In immunoprecipitates of the Flt3 and upon overexpression of HAtagged ubiquitin (Ubq)	 we detected the ubiquitylated form of both Flt3-WT and Flt3-ITD. Ubiquitylation of wild-type Flt3 was increased by FL	 while the addition of FL to COS-7 cells that expressed Flt3-ITD did not result in an enhancement of Flt3 ubiquitylation. Importantly	 coexpression of the dominant-negative Cbl-70Z almost abolished ubiquitylation of the receptor	 suggesting Cbl proteins as the major E3 ubiquitin ligases for Flt3. Hence	 Cbl protein function is necessary for Flt3 ubiquitylation. The degradation kinetics of Flt3-WT and Flt3-ITD are not grossly different. These data suggest that c-Cbl is involved in the degradation of wild-type and mutationally activated Flt3 proteins. Cbl-70Z induces ligand-independent growth in cooperation with Flt3 Having observed critical importance of Cbl proteins for Flt3 ubiquitylation	 we examined whether interference with Cbl function would alter the biologic outcome of Flt3 activation. Therefore	 we coexpressed the receptor with Cbl-70Z in 32D cells and analyzed their growth and survival. To exclude clonal evolution of the cultures that may lead to a selection of cells with autoactivated Flt3 receptors	 we analyzed bulk cultures instead of single clones. We starved cells from IL-3 that stably expressed different c-Cbl forms and/or Flt3 receptors and assessed the transforming potential of Cbl in the presence or absence of Flt3 by analyzing cellular proliferation and viability. Interestingly	 cells coexpressing Flt3-WT and Cbl-70Z rapidly proliferated in the absence of exogenous growth factors. However	 in the absence of Cbl-70Z	 cells expressing Flt3-WT alone proliferated only in the presence of FL (Figure 3A and data not shown). Cultures expressing only Cbl-70Z (without Flt3 receptors) survived longer after cytokine withdrawal (Figure 3B). However	 these cultures failed to proliferate in a cytokine-independent manner and died off after a few days of culture in cytokine-free media (Figure 3A). These findings suggest that Cbl-70Z conferred apoptosis resistance to these cells but was incapable of inducing significant proliferative activity. Interestingly	 coexpression of Flt3-WT and Cbl-70Z rescued proliferation	 and these cells were able to grow cytokine independently for extended time periods. In contrast	 expression of Flt3-WT (in the absence of FL) alone did not lead to proliferation. Finally	 we analyzed the effects of Cbl-70Z on cytokine-independent and Flt3-dependent proliferation by directly comparing it with IL-3â€“ dependent proliferation in thymidine incorporation assays (Figure 3C). In the absence of Flt3	 Cbl-70Z induced only minimal proliferation (Figure 3C). Coexpression of Cbl-70Z with Flt3-WT induced a robust proliferative response that was further enhanced by Flt3 activation. Importantly	 a Flt3-specific inhibitor	 SU11248	 suppressed proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Notably	 the major effects of Cbl-70Z were again independent from the presence of FL	 although they required the presence of the receptor. In contrast to wild-type Flt3	 we did not observe any significant synergistic effects of the coexpression of Flt3-ITD with Cbl-70Z	 Figure 2. c-Cbl facilitates ubiquitylation of Flt3. (A) Flt3 receptor is rapidly degraded in 32D cells. The 32D cells expressing Flt3-WT or Flt3-ITD receptors were starved overnight	 and pretreated for 2 hours with cycloheximide before incubating with FL for the indicated time points. Cells were harvested at the indicated time points	 cell lysates were resolved on SDS-PAGE	 and Flt3 protein levels were determined using anti-Flt3 antibodies. The densitometric analyses were performed as described in â€œMaterials and methods.â€ The closed circles (upper) depict degradation of the presumably mature form of Flt3 (160 kDa)	 while the open circles (lower) show degradation of the immature form of Flt3 (130 kDa). (B) Ubiquitylation of Flt3 is inhibited by Cbl-70Z. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with plasmid constructs encoding Flt3-WT or -ITD with or without Cbl-70Z	 together with a plasmid encoding HA-tagged ubiquitin. At 48 hours after transfection	 cells were left unstimulated or were exposed to FL as indicated. Flt3 immunoprecipitates were resolved on SDS-PAGE and ubiquitylation of Flt3 was analyzed by immunoblotting the membranes with an anti-HA antibody.

For personal use only. presumably due to full activation of proliferative signals by the constitutively active Flt3-ITD alone (data not shown). Identification and characterization of a novel Cbl point mutation in AML The data presented above suggested that interference with Cbl function may be involved in myeloid transformation. In animal models	 several oncogenic Cbl mutations have been described	 and all are clustered in the RING domain or in the linker region.15	30 Therefore	 we analyzed the coding sequences of the corresponding exons in c-Cbl and Cbl-b from the blasts of 150 AML patients by direct cDNA and genomic DNA sequencing. The cDNA and genomic DNA of c-Cbl from one AML patient with a normal karyotype and no Flt3 mutation contained a G to A substitution at position 1259 of the published human c-Cbl sequence that results in the substitution of the charged arginine residue at position 420 with glutamine (R420Q) (Figure 4A). The presence of the mutation was independently verified in the cDNA and the genomic DNA in both directions	 using different PCR products and different sequencing primers. Arginine 420 is evolutionary highly conserved and has been suggested to be involved in the contact site of Cbl with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugation enzyme UbcH7.31 We cloned this c-Cbl mutant (Cbl-R420Q) into an expression vector and analyzed its association with Flt3 and the consequences of its presence for Flt3 ubiquitylation and internalization. As shown in Figure 4B	 CblR420Q associates with Flt3-WT. Flt3 was readily ubiquitylated after ligand activation in the presence of wild-type c-Cbl	 but not in the presence of Cbl-R420Q (Figure 4B-C). In vitro ubiquitylation assays revealed that in contrast to the wild-type RING domain	 the RING domain containing the R420Q mutation was unable to function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for Flt3 (Figure 4D). RTK signal mitigation has been shown to be dependent on Cbl-mediated receptor internalization and ubiquitylation.5	7	31	32 Therefore	 we analyzed the consequences of Cbl-R420Q overexpression for RTK internalization. Interestingly	 Cbl-R420Q strongly inhibited ligand-induced internalization of EGFR and PDGFR	 a process dependent on intact Cbl function (Figure 4E). Furthermore	 Cbl-R420Q inhibited Flt3 internalization to a similar extent as Cbl-70Z. In conclusion	 we have identified a Cbl mutation in primary blasts from an AML patient that effectively inhibits ubiquitylation and internalization of RTKs upon overexpression. Cbl-R420Q has transforming capacity in the presence of Flt3 We next analyzed the biologic significance of the AML-associated Cbl mutation (Cbl-R420Q) in myeloid cells. Similar to Cbl-70Z	 Cbl-R420Q mutant induced proliferation and survival of 32D cells (Figure 5A-C) and induced long-term	 cytokine-independent proliferation of the cultures exclusively in the presence of Flt3. The effects of SU11248 on the biologic effects of concomitant Cbl-70Z and Flt3 expression (Figure 3D) indicated that the Flt3 kinase activity was necessary for the observed synergistic biologic effects. To exclude the possibility that off-target effects of chemical kinase inhibitors might be responsible for growth inhibition of the cells	 we coexpressed a kinase-inactive Flt3 mutant with Cbl-R420Q in 32D cells. As expected from the inhibitor experiments	 kinase-dead Flt3 (Flt3-K644A) failed to induce autonomous growth of 32D cells	 even in the presence of Cbl-R420Q (Figure 5A-C). We then analyzed the effects of Cbl proteins on the strength	 the quality	 and the duration of Flt3 signaling (Figure 5D-E). Coexpression of wild-type Cbl with Flt3 receptors led to diminished activation of Akt and Erk signaling. In contrast	 coexpression of Cbl-70Z (Figure 5D) or Cbl-R420Q (Figure 5E and data not shown) induced a stronger activation of the Akt and Erk pathways as indicated by phosphorylation of the respective signaling intermediates after 10 minutes. In time course experiments	 we observed a signifi- cantly prolonged activation of Erk activity up to 60 minutes after FL stimulation in cells coexpressing Cbl-70Z or Cbl-R420Q (Figure 5E). In summary	 our data show that the newly identified AML-associated Cbl mutation R420Q disturbs Flt3 signal mitigation comparable with Cbl-70Z	 and likewise affects 32D cell growth in an Flt3 kinaseâ€“dependent manner. Discussion In human cancers	 deregulated activation of receptor tyrosine kinases is a frequent event. Aberrant activation of RTKs can be induced by inappropriate ligand stimulation	 by overexpression due to genetic amplification	 or by activating or sensitizing mutations in the coding region of the RTKs.33-35 Also	 inappropriate activation of RTKs by loss of negative regulators is increasingly recognized as a possible alternative mechanism to lead to aberrant RTK activity in cancer cells.36-39 The RTK Flt3 is highly expressed in AML and it is widely accepted that deregulated Flt3 activity has important functions in AML pathogenesis. To understand the mechanisms that control Flt3 signaling	 we have analyzed the role of c-Cbl for Flt3 regulation. We show that c-Cbl physically Figure 3. Cbl-70Z and Flt3 synergize to induce autonomous growth. (A	B) Cbl-70Z induces ligand-independent proliferation and survival of 32D-Flt3-WT cells. The 32D cells overexpressing the indicated Flt3 and or Cbl proteins were grown in the presence of 10% FCS alone or supplemented with FL or IL-3. Cells were counted at the indicated time points by the trypan blue exclusion method. The data are shown as fold change of the cell number compared with the start of the experiment (panel A). (B) The proportion of cells in the culture that was alive is shown. The data represent the average and standard deviation of 3 independent experiments. (C) Ligandindependent DNA synthesis of Flt3-WT cells coexpressing Cbl-70Z. The 32D cells overexpressing Flt3-WT and/or Cbl constructs were starved from IL-3 and proliferation was measured in [3H]-thymidine incorporation assays. Data are shown as percentage of thymidine incorporation relative to the thymidine incorporation of the respective cell line with IL-3 supplementation. (D) The Flt3-specific inhibitor SU11248 inhibits proliferation of Cbl-70Zâ€“coexpressing 32D-Flt3-WT cells. Proliferation of 32D cells expressing Flt3-WT with or without Cbl-70Z was analyzed as in panel C. 1008 SARGIN et al BLOOD	 1 AUGUST 2007   VOLUME 110	 NUMBER 3 From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 26	 2017. For personal use only. associates with Flt3-WT as well as with the most common activating Flt3 mutation	 Flt3-ITD.We also show that upon ligand stimulation	 Flt3 is rapidly ubiquitylated and that a known dominant-negative mutant of c-Cbl (Cbl-70Z) inhibits Flt3 internalization and ubiquitylation (Figure 2) with the consequence of a longer duration of Flt3 signaling (Figure 5). Also	 we confirm previous results that tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl is enhanced by Flt3 activation.25 Sequencing analysis of Cbl in blasts from a cohort of AML patients revealed a single case of a somatic mutation in the RING domain of c-Cbl (Cbl-R420Q). Analysis of the amino acid substitution and comparison of the resulting mutant protein with the published structure of the c-Cbl ubiquitin ligase domain suggests that this mutant residue is critically involved in the binding of c-Cbl with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc-H7 and suggests that a mutation at this position may inhibit the E3 ligase activity of c-Cbl.31 Indeed	 we present biochemical evidence that the R420Q mutation strongly inhibits the ubiquitin ligase activity of c-Cbl	 the essential function of c-Cbl required for RTK signaling mitigation. Our data also provide evidence that Cbl-mediated regulation of Flt3 is biologically important. Coexpression of Cbl-70Z or Cbl-R420Q with Flt3 readily transformed 32D cells	 even in the absence of Flt3 ligand. It has been previously reported that dominant-negative Cbl mutants enhance the survival of myeloid cells. However	 as in our report	 they alone did not support cellular proliferation.40 Here	 we observed a strong synergism between Cbl-70Z or Cbl-R420Q and Flt3 receptors in myeloid transformation. Its exact molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. However	 our data obtained with a Flt3-specific inhibitor (Figure 3D) and the kinase-inactive Flt3 receptor (Figure 5A) suggest that Flt3 kinase activity is required for the observed synergism. It appears likely that Cbl-70Z and Cbl-R420Q cause a low but constitutive activation of the Flt3 receptor. Since Cbl proteins have been shown to also associate with c-kit and influence c-kit activity	6	41	42 it may well be that the observed synergism relates not only to Flt3	 but also to other hematopoietic type III RTKs. Further work will be required to analyze the effects of dominant-negative Cbl proteins in cells expressing various RTKs. Taken together	 these data show that Cbl proteins are directly involved in Flt3 signal control and suggest that interference with the function of negative regulators of RTK signaling may play a role in AML transformation. To our knowledge	 the novel Cbl-R420Q mutation identified here is the first reported Cbl mutation with obvious transforming ability in human disease. Although we identified this mutation in a single patient	 it is possible that alterations in the negative regulatory machinery of RTKs are more frequently involved in leukemogenic signal transduction. First	 Cbl proteins consist of a family of several members with presumably redundant function. Dominant-negative mutations in any Cbl family member may induce similar effects as observed for Cbl-R420Q. Also	 termination of RTK signaling is a complex multistep process	 which requires several sorting	 segregation	 and degradation steps	 each of which involve many different proteins.43-45 It may well be that other proteins involved in these processes may be mutated more frequently in AML and possibly in other human cancers. This notion	 at least in part	 is also supported by data showing that proteins involved in the endocytosis machinery are often constituents of oncogenic fusion proteins.39	46	47 Furthermore	 inappropriate expression of proteins involved in endocytic sorting (ie	 Hrs and Tsg101) have also been implicated in human cancers.39 The potent effects of Figure 4. Cbl-R420Q inhibits ubiquitylation and endocytosis of RTKs. (A) Identification of a novel Cbl mutant from an AML patient. The cDNA from 150 AML patients was screened for Cbl mutations by direct sequencing as described in â€œMaterials and methods.â€ c-Cbl of one patient showed a heterozygous mutation at position 1259 (G A)	 resulting in replacement of arginine 420 by glutamine of c-Cbl. (B	C) Cbl-R420Q binds to Flt3 and inhibits ubiquitylation of Flt3. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with the indicated plasmids together with a plasmid for HA-tagged ubiquitin. Forty-eight hours later	 cell lysates were prepared and equal amounts of lysate were immunoprecipitated using anti-Flt3 or anti-HA antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were resolved on SDS-PAGE and analyzed with anti-HA or anti-Cbl (panel B) or anti-Flt3 (panel C) antibodies. (D) The R420Q mutation results in loss of Cbl E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. The 293T cells were transiently transfected with Flt3 and Flt3 was immunoprecipitated. The immunoprecipitated Flt3 was incubated with His-tagged ubiquitin and the indicated Cbl RING finger constructs and in vitro ubiquitylation was performed as described in â€œMaterials and methods.â€ The reaction mixtures were separated on SDS-PAGE and ubiquitylation of Flt3 was analyzed by immunoblotting the membrane with anti-His antibodies. (E) Internalization of EGFR	 PDGFR	 and Flt3 is inhibited by the mutant Cbl. The surface level of receptors following time lapse (up to 60 minutes) after EGF	 PDGF	 or FL stimulation was analyzed by receptor down-regulation assays. The results are expressed as a percentage of the [125I]-labeled EGF or PDGF bound to cell surface receptor after stimulation by nonlabeled EGF or PDGF for the indicated times. For Flt3	 the surface expression of HA-tagged Flt3 was analyzed by flow cytometry after staining with an anti-HA antibody. The total level of steady-state surface EGFR after 2.5 days of transfection was detected using [125I]-EGF without preceding incubation with nonlabeled EGF. Results are expressed as means plus or minus SD of 3 independent experiments.

For personal use only. the point mutation of c-Cbl on myeloid cell proliferation and survival warrant further search for such mutations in clonal myeloid disorders	 especially in patients without known activating mutations in signaling intermediates. Originally	 c-Cbl was described as a proto-oncogene of an animal virus that induced lymphoma in mice.48 It has been shown that the corresponding viral oncogene	 v-Cbl	 is a relatively weak oncogene.5 V-Cbl is a truncated protein	 consisting of the Nterminal half of Cbl	 retaining not much more than the PTB domain of c-Cbl. Subsequently	 the description of other	 more potent Cbl oncogenes led to the definition of requirements for the transforming potential of Cbl proteins.5	38 Presence of the PTB domain and simultaneous interference with the E3 ligase function of c-Cbl have been defined to be essential minimal requirements for Cblmediated transformation	 presumably through dominant-negative interference with the normal Cbl function. Our biochemical analyses here show that Cbl-R420Q fulfils these requirements. However	 it is not quite clear	 whether Cbl-mediated transformation is solely due to dominant-negative effects of oncogenic Cbl proteins	 or whether the mutations also provide a gain of function. Homozygous c-Cbl knock-out mice do not display an obvious tumor phenotype	5	49 suggesting that the c-Cbl mutations that we analyzed here are dominant-negative over not only c-Cbl. One explanation could be that they are dominant negative over several Cbl family members	 circumventing redundancy that could explain the lack of the knock-out phenotype. Alternatively	 the transforming phenotype of oncogenic Cbl mutants could be due to an additional gain of function	 which provides activating signals to the cells. For example	 it has been shown that c-Cbl binds to and activates Cool-1	 which on the one hand inhibits Cbl-mediated receptor endocytosis and degradation	 and on the other hand functions as a regulated guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Cdc42. This (presumably protooncogenic) GEF activity is activated by its phosphorylation in Cbl-Cool-1-tyrosine kinase complexes.50	51 Furthermore	 phosphorylated c-Cbl forms complexes with PI3-K leading to Akt and Erk activation.52 The Src family kinases Fyn and Lyn associate more strongly with increasingly phosphorylated c-Cbl.53-55 Recruitment of the CrkL adaptor protein by c-Cbl has been reported to facilitate activation of Jnk and Rap1. All these examples illustrate the extensive positive involvement of Cbl proteins in signaling.56-58 Most of these activities have been mapped to the C-terminal multiadaptor domain	 which contains phosphotyrosine sites that can bind to positive signal regulators such as SHP2 and PI3- K.13	52	56	59 Consequently	 oncogenic Cbl proteins that retain the C-terminal part have been shown to be more potent than Cbl oncogenes lacking this domain.5	15 Furthermore	 the phosphotyrosine sites in the C-terminus are highly phosphorylated in Cbl-70Z	 suggesting that this region of Cbl may play an important role in oncogenic properties at least of Cbl-70Z. Interestingly	 the novel Cbl-R420Q mutation fulfils all the requirements of potent Cbl oncogenes	 since it consists only of a point mutation in the E3 ligase domain of c-Cbl	 maintaining all other protein domains that are potentially involved in positively mediating oncogenic RTK signaling. Importantly	 Cbl mutantâ€“mediated transformation depended on the presence of Flt3 and can be blocked by Flt3 kinase inhibitors. Given the near-universal importance of the Cbl-associated machinery in RTK signal mitigation	 it is very likely that mutations in the involved proteins (such as Cbl R420Q) are influenced in their transforming activity by different RTKs. Thus	 our data provide an important example for the critical involvement of tyrosine kinases in a transformation mechanism	 where the primary genetic defect is localized in the negative regulatory machinery. Hence	 patients without activating mutations in RTKs may suffer from RTK-driven disease and may benefit from kinase inhibitor treatment	 similar to patients harboring activating RTK mutations. Collectively	 the data presented here illustrate a novel mechanism of Flt3-mediated transformation in AML through somatic mutation in a protein involved in the termination of RTK signaling. We show that dominant-negative forms of the E3 ligase c-Cbl induce autonomous growth in cytokine-dependent myeloid progenitor cells. However	 this effect is strictly dependent on the presence of Flt3 kinase activity and can be targeted by Flt3 kinase inhibitors. Our results justify further analyses of negative tyrosine kinase regulatory networks that may be dysfunctional to cause oncogenic signal transduction in AML.  Recent evidence has demonstrated that acquired uniparental disomy (aUPD) is a novel mechanism by which pathogenetic mutations in cancer may be reduced to homozygosity. To help identify novel mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs)	 we performed a genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) screen to identify aUPD in 58 patients with atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML; n = 30)	 JAK2 mutationâ€“negative myelofibrosis (MF; n = 18)	 or JAK2 mutationâ€“negative polycythemia vera (PV; n = 10). Stretches of homozygous	 copy neutral SNP calls greater than 20Mb were seen in 10 (33%) aCML and 1 (6%) MF	 but were absent in PV. In total	 7 different chromosomes were involved with 7q and 11q each affected in 10% of aCML cases. CBL mutations were identified in all 3 cases with 11q aUPD and analysis of 574 additional MPNs revealed a total of 27 CBL variants in 26 patients with aCML	 myelofibrosis or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Most variants were missense substitutions in the RING or linker domains that abrogated CBL ubiquitin ligase activity and conferred a proliferative advantage to 32D cells overexpressing FLT3. We conclude that acquired	 transforming CBL mutations are a novel and widespread pathogenetic abnormality in morphologically related	 clinically aggressive MPNs.  Introduction  Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by overproliferation of one or more myeloid cell lineages in the bone marrow and increased numbers of mature and immature myeloid cells in the peripheral blood. Excess proliferation is frequently associated with splenomegaly and cardiovascular complications as well as increased risk of transformation to acute leukemia. MPNs are categorized into subtypes based on specific morphologic	 hematologic	 and laboratory parameters	 the best characterized being the 4 so-called classic MPNs: polycythemia vera (PV)	 essential thrombocythemia (ET)	 primary myelofibrosis (MF)	 and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).1 In addition	 several atypical MPNs are recognized	 some of which show both dysplastic and proliferative features	 such as atypical	 BCR-ABL negative CML (aCML).2  MPNs are associated with acquired	 activating mutations or gene fusions of tyrosine kinases	 abnormalities that are believed to be critical drivers of excess proliferation as a result of deregulated or constitutive signaling.3 The 2 most prominent examples are BCR-ABL in CML4 and the V617F JAK2 mutation in PV	 ET	 and MF	5â‡“â‡“â€“8 but more than 40 variant tyrosine kinase fusions have been identified in MPNs as well as other mutations in JAK2 and FLT3.2 Activating mutations have been described in components that signal upstream (eg	 MPL) or downstream (eg	 NRAS) of tyrosine kinases9	10; however	 the molecular pathogenesis of the majority of atypical MPNs and approximately 50% of ET and MF cases remains obscure.  V617F JAK2 was initially identified by several different routes	 one of which was based on the observation that many PV patients show evidence of acquired uniparental disomy (aUPD) at chromosome 9p.11	12 Regions of aUPD exhibit loss of heterozygosity (LOH) compared with constitutional DNA without change of copy number and arise by mitotic recombination followed by selection for one of the products. After the initial observations in PV	 it has emerged that aUPD is common in both hematologic and epithelial malignancies	 and is associated with known oncogenic changes in a variety of genes within the affected regions.13 In this study we set out to determine whether aUPD characterizes MPNs of unknown molecular etiology and	 if so	 whether it could be used as a tool to help identify novel driver mutations.  Methods  Patients  Peripheral blood or bone marrow samples were received from patients diagnosed with an MPN or other hematologic malignancy according to standard morphologic	 hematologic	 and laboratory criteria. Clinical data were available from a subset of these cases. The study was approved by the Internal Review Boards from participating institutions and informed consent was obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.  SNP array analysis  DNA labeling and hybridization to Affymetrix 50k XbaI chips was performed at the Deutsches Ressourcenzentrum fÃ¼r Genomforschung (RZPD	 Berlin	 Germany). Raw data were imported into the Affymetrix GeneChip Operating Software	 analyzed using Affymetrix (High Wycombe	 United Kingdom) GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE 4.1) and copy number analysis tool (CNAT). Data were exported to custom-designed spreadsheets that display loss of heterozygosity and copy number changes in ideogram format. Data were also analyzed using Affymetrix Genotyping Console (version 2.1). Overall	 a median of 98.2% (range	 91.5%-99.6%) of SNPs gave readable calls.  Mutation analysis  Detection of mutations by high resolution melting (HRM) analysis was performed as described14 using a Rotor-Gene 6000 (Corbett Life Sciences	 St Neots	 United Kingdom). Direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products was performed by standard techniques on an ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems	 Warrington	 United Kingdom) and analyzed using Mutation Surveyor (SoftGenetics	 State College	 PA). CBL mutations are numbered relative to the ATG (A = 1) in the Ensembl cDNA sequence ENSG00000110395. A dropping factor (relative intensity drop of the wild-type allele peak relative to that seen in a concurrently run normal sample) of 60% or more was considered indicative of a biallelic mutation whereas a dropping factor of less than 60% was considered as monoallelic. Primer sequences for CBL exon 8 were CBL_i7f (5â€²-tgtggtttcactttaaaccctgga-3â€²) and CBL_i8r (5â€²-gccaggccaccccttgtatc-3â€²) and for CBL exon 9 were CBL_i8f (5â€²-ggcctggcttttgggttagg-3â€²) and CBL_i9r (5â€²-cacaatggattttgccagtctcc-3â€²). CBL reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) was performed on random hexamerâ€“reverse transcribed RNA using primers CBLe7F: 5â€²-gaatcctgatctgactggcttatg-3â€² and CBLe10R 5â€²-gctgcggcagaaggtcaagt-3â€². Other primer sequences are available on request.  Microsatellite analysis  DNA samples were amplified with a series of fluorescently labeled primer pairs flanking highly polymorphic microsatellite markers on chromosome 11q as described.10 aUPD was scored if 4 or more consecutive markers encompassing CBL were homozygous without change in allelic copy number (P < .05 of this occurring in the absence of aUPD based on published rates of heterozygosity). Copy number at 11q was estimated by multiplex ligation probe amplification (MLPA) using the Marfan probeset 1 (P065; MRC Holland	 Amsterdam	 The Netherlands)	 a kit that contains four 11q control probes including one at 11q23.3.  Constructs  pMY-wtCBL and pMY-CBLR420Q express wild-type and R420Q CBL	 respectively	 along with green fluorescent protein (GFP).15 Other CBL mutant constructs were derived from pMY-wtCBL using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene	 La Jolla	 CA). pAL/FLT3 and pCMVâ€“HA ubiquitin have also been described previously.15  Cell lines  The IL-3â€“dependent murine myeloid cell 32Dcl3 (32D) was purchased from the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (Braunschweig	 Germany) and was maintained in 90% RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10% WEHI-3B conditioned medium (WEHI). All cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37Â°C and 5% carbon dioxide. 32D cells were stably transduced by electroporation with wt-FLT3 in a pAL vector as previously described16 and maintained in 15 ng/mL blastocidin (Invitrogen	 Paisley United Kingdom). The Platinum-E (Plat-E) retrovirus packaging cell line17 was transfected using the calcium phosphate method with 5 Î¼g CBL construct DNA: 106 32D/wtFLT3 cells were cocultivated with the Plat-E cells for 48 hours in a volume of 2 mL (50% RPMI	 50% DMEM	 10% FBS	 5% WEHI). GFP positive cells were flow sorted to highest possible purity using a BD FACSAria cell sorter (Becton Dickinson	 Stanford	 CA). If insufficient cells were obtained for experiments after flow sorting	 the cells were maintained in culture and resorted to greater than 95% purity.  Growth factor withdrawal assays  Cell growth was compared with wt-FLT3	 vector-only transfected cells and the parental 32D line in stably transfected cells. Cells (105/mL) were grown over 3 days in triplicate for each CBL mutant and a wt-CBL control in 96-well plates. Cultures were analyzed daily for proliferation using the Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit (MTS assay; Promega	 Southampton	 United Kingdom). All experiments were performed at least 3 times independently and results were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 4 software (GraphPad Software	 San Diego	 CA).  Ubiquitin ligase activity  The ubiquitin ligase activity of CBL mutants in comparison to wild-type CBL was determined by transiently transfecting 107 32D/wtFLT3 cells expressing wild-type or CBL mutants by electroporation with 20 Î¼g pCMV-HA ubiquitin. Cells were maintained in culture with WEHI for 12 hours after transfection before being washed	 serum deprived overnight	 exposed to FLT3 ligand for 10 minutes	 and lysed in buffer as described.18 Lysates were incubated with a FLT3-specific polyclonal antibody overnight at 4Â°C. Protein G agarose beads (100 Î¼L) were added and incubated at 4Â°C for 4 hours. The beads were washed 4 times in ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer. The supernatant was mixed with sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) sample loading buffer before immunoblot analyses with antibodies against HA-ubiquitin (sc-805; Santa Cruz Biotechnology	 Santa Cruz	 CA)	 CBL (2111C3a; Abcam	 Cambridge	 United Kingdom)	 and FLT3 (sc-479; Cell Signaling Technology	 Danvers	 MA).  Results  SNP array analysis  We performed genome-wide SNP analysis on leukocyte DNA extracted from 58 MPD patients: aCML (n = 30)	 V617F JAK2 negative MF (n = 18)	 and JAK2 mutation negative PV/idiopathic erythrocytosis (n = 10). As comparators	 we also analyzed cases of CML in transformation to blast crisis (n = 30	 of which 20 were myeloid and 10 lymphoid) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; n = 20). We conservatively defined likely regions of aUPD as at least 20 Mb of absent or significantly reduced heterozygous SNP calls (ie	 < 5% SNPs called as heterozygous) running to a telomere without change in copy number (Figure 1A). Such large regions are uncommon in healthy individuals.19 Strikingly	 we found that aUPD was common in aCML with 10 (33%) of cases affected. In contrast	 aUPD was only seen in a single case of MF and was not seen in other patient subgroups. In total	 7 different chromosomes were affected	 with abnormalities at 7q and 11q each seen recurrently in 10% of aCML cases. The affected regions ranged in size from 29 Mb to a complete copy of chromosome 13 (Table 1).

(A) Array analysis of 2 control patients showing copy number (CN) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) outputs. The x-axis for the CN plots show (copy number)âˆ’2 as determined by CNAT	 with values approaching or exceeding âˆ’1 indicating deletions and greater than +1 indicating amplifications. The x-axis for LOH shows log10 P values (ie	 20 indicates 10âˆ’20). The 2 panels on the left are from a polycythemia vera (PV) case with a homozygous V617F JAK2 mutation. There is no gross copy number change (individual datapoints spread around the zero line)	 but a large block of homozygous SNP calls at 9p indicative of aUPD. The 2 panels on the right are from a chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) blast crisis case and show LOH accompanied by a 20q deletion. (B) For case UPN 5	 a large block of 11q aUPD is apparent on analysis of granulocytes but almost completely absent from mononuclear cells (MNCs) extracted from the same sample. (C) Chromosome 1p aUPD in case UPN 27 is associated with a biallelic G>T MPL mutation that is predicted to result in a W515L substitution. (D) Whole chromosome 13 isodisomy in case UPN 28 associated with a homozygous FLT3 ITD. Two controls are shown: an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient previously known to have a heterozygous FLT3 ITD and a healthy individual. View inlineView popup Table 1 Chromosomal regions and cases affected by aUPD Association between aUPD and known acquired oncogenic mutations  Although we did not have constitutional DNA to formally confirm that the regions of homozygosity were acquired	 in 1 individual we found a marked reduction in the proportion of 11q aUPD positive cells on comparison of mononuclear cells and granulocytes	 consistent with an acquired abnormality (Figure 1B). Some of the affected regions harbor genes known to be relevant to hematologic malignancies and therefore we assessed their mutational status. Sequencing of the MPL gene in the case UPN 27 with 1p aUPD revealed a homozygous G>T change (Figure 1C) that results in the previously reported W515L substitution.9 Case UPN 28 with whole chromosome 13 UPD had a homozygous FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD; Figure 1D). Candidate genes for the abnormalities at 17q and 21q include NF1 and RUNX1	 respectively; however	 these were not investigated.  11q aUPD is associated with CBL mutations  Next	 we focused our analysis on the 2 recurrent regions of aUPD at 7q and 11q. Because of the strong association between MPNs and aberrant tyrosine kinase signaling	 we analyzed genes encoding tyrosine kinases and associated signaling components. The minimally affected region at chromosome 7q contains 3 tyrosine kinases: MET	 EPHA1	 and EPHB6. We fully sequenced the coding exons of these genes in the 3 cases with 7q aUPD and 2 normal controls but found no abnormalities. Similarly	 we found no sequence changes in exons 11 through 17 of BRAF	 a gene encoding a downstream component of RAS signaling that is mutated in malignant melanoma and other cancers.20 There are no tyrosine kinase genes on chromosome 11q	 and although there are several genes encoding signal transduction components	 CBL stood out as a known oncogene that negatively regulates tyrosine kinase signaling.21 Sequencing of CBL in the three 11q aUPD cases revealed that UPN 2 and UPN 5 each had a T>C change at nucleotide 1277 in exon 8 that predicts a L380P substitution. Case UPN 3 had a C>G missense change in exon 9 at nucleotide 1387 that predicts a P417A change (Figure 2). Consistent with the array results	 the mutations in cases UPN 3 and UPN 5 were predominant with the residual wild-type alleles only weakly visible. For case UPN 2 both the mutation and level of aUPD was less prominent	 presumably due to a greater background of normal cells.

Prevalence and nature of CBL mutations  To determine the prevalence of CBL mutations	 we sequenced exons 8 and 9 (that encode amino acids 366 through 409 and 410 through 477	 respectively) in an additional 574 MPN cases. A total of 27 sequence variants were identified in 26 patients	 of whom 3 had MF	 10 had chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML)	 12 had aCML and 1 had hypereosinophilic syndrome/chronic eosinophilic leukemia (HES/CEL; Tables 2 and 3). To ensure that we were not missing mutations elsewhere in the gene we analyzed all coding exons in 70 CBL mutation negative aCML or unclassified	 CML-like MPN cases by high resolution melt (HRM) analysis but failed to detect any further sequence changes apart from known polymorphisms. Similarly	 no mutations in CBLB exons 9 or 10 or CBLC exons 7 and 8 (the exons that correspond to CBL exons 8 and 9) were identified. The activity of BCR-ABL is known to increase during progression of CML from chronic phase to blast crisis22 and we speculated that abrogation of CBL activity might be at least partially responsible for this increase. HRM analysis of CBL exons 8 and 9 in blast crisis cases (n = 31)	 however	 failed to reveal any mutations.  View inlineView popup Table 2 Cases analyzed for CBL mutations View inlineView popup Table 3 List of CBL sequence variants Of the 27 CBL variants	 21 (78%) were missense substitutions affecting 12 amino acids (15 different substitutions)	 5 (19%) were candidate splicing abnormalities	 and 1 (3%) produced a stop codon (Table 3). Most of the changes were novel	 although 4 cases had R420Q as previously identified in a single case of AML.15 Apart from N454D	 all residues affected by missense mutations were completely conserved in CBL orthologues as well as the 2 other human CBL family members (Figure 3). The mutation to a stop codon was found in a patient (UPN 9) who also had the Y371H variant; PCR across the affected regions and sequencing indicated that the 2 changes were on different alleles.

Residues affected by missense mutations found in this study are indicated by â–¼. CBL mutations are acquired and rarely seen in conjunction with other known mutations  For 2 cases (UPN 5 and UPN 14) we were able to compare the mutational status of leukocytes and T cells or buccal epithelia cells. In both cases the L380P mutation was only present in leukocytes and was therefore acquired (Figure 4A). A third case (UPN 15) originally presented with V617F JAK2 negative ET in 1989 but progressed to MF in 2004. Analysis of DNA extracted from sequential bone marrow slides indicated that the R420Q mutation was absent at the ET phase but acquired on transformation (Figure 4B). The 3 CBL-positive MF cases tested negative for MPL 515 mutations and all CBL mutation positive cases were negative for cytogenetic indicators of tyrosine kinase fusions	 FLT3 ITD	 activating NRAS mutations and V617F JAK2	 with the exception of 1 case (UPN 14) with MF who tested positive for both L380P CBL and V617F JAK2. Analysis of retrospective bone marrow slides for this case indicated the presence of V617F JAK2 at low level initially but absence of L380P CBL. The CBL mutation was detectable 7 years later and completely displaced V617F after a further 3 years	 corresponding with a significant rise is peripheral leukocyte counts (Figure 4C). A further case (UPN 21) presented with systemic mastocytosis before evolving to CBL mutation-positive CMML but retrospective samples were unavailable.

The JAK2 V617F mutation	 which had been present at low level since diagnosis	 was still detectable when CBL L380P first appeared but was undetectable in the 2008 sample	 when the CBL mutated clone predominated (* on sequence trace). (D) RT-PCR analysis. All cases and controls show the expected product from CBL exons 7-10. Cases UPN 18 and UPN 20 show smaller bands that result from complete deletion of exon 8. Splicing abnormalities  RNA was available for 3 of the 5 cases with potential splicing mutations. Patients UPN 18 and UPN 20 both exhibited double bands by RT-PCR	 sequencing of which showed one to be the normal product and the smaller band to result from the complete deletion of exon 8 in each case (Figure 4D)	 similar to that described in the cell line MOLM-13.23 Patient UPN 19 showed a single band by RT-PCR that was entirely normal on sequence analysis indicating that the exon 8+4 C>T change does not alter splicing. It seems likely	 therefore	 that the variant identified in case UPN 6 is also of no consequence. The pathogenicity of the intronic variant seen in case UPN 13 remains unknown.  The association between CBL mutations and UPD  To examine the association between CBL mutations and aUPD in more detail we performed microsatellite analysis on all mutated cases using 9 polymorphic markers spanning chromosome 11q13-qter. Of the 26 cases	 11 displayed patterns that indicated significant tracts of homozygosity	 including all 3 with 11q aUPD detected by SNP arrays. Case UPN 9 with 2 mutations was heterozygous for all markers. Of the 11 cases with biallelic CBL mutations as judged by sequence analysis	 5 showed complete homozygosity at all microsatellite loci tested and 6 had at least 4 consecutive homozygous calls encompassing the location of the CBL gene at 11q23.3 (Figure 5). We performed multiplex ligation probe amplification (MLPA) analysis to determine whether the observed homozygosity was a consequence of a deletion but no copy number changes were detected (data not shown) and therefore it is likely that homozygosity arose by aUPD. The number of mutated alleles estimated by sequencing was concordant with the microsatellite analysis in 20 cases (Figure 5). Of those that were discordant	 UPN 6 and UPN 25 had significant tracts of 11q homozygosity but had a monoallelic CBL mutation whereas UPN 10 and UPN 16 did not show 11q homozygosity but had clear biallelic CBL mutations. The reason for these discrepant cases is unclear	 but it is possible that the aUPD seen in UPN 6 and UPN 25 targeted another gene at 11q before acquisition of the CBL mutation. Homozygosity for the CBL mutations in the absence of 11q aUPD in UPN 10 and UPN 16 might be explained by a subcytogenetic deletion of 1 allele.

The number of CBL mutated alleles (1 monoallelic; 2 biallelic) was estimated by sequence analysis as described in â€œExperimental procedures.â€ Microsatellites were scored as homozygous (Embedded Image) or heterozygous (â–¡) for each case and their positions on chromosome 11q are indicated. Correlation between CBL mutations and clinical features  We compared clinical and hematologic features in patients with or without CBL mutations	 restricting the analysis to cases with aCML	 MF and CMML because these were the subgroups in which CBL mutations were most commonly found. Patients with CBL mutations had a shorter overall survival and progression-free survival compared with mutation negative cases (overall survival: 33 months vs 39 months; progression-free survival: 22 months vs 32 months) but the differences were not significant (Figure 6). Similarly there was no significant difference in gender distribution	 age and standard hematologic parameters between mutation positive and mutation negative cases and no differences emerged when individual disease entities were considered.

Overall survival (A) and progression-free survival (B) for atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML)	 chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML)	 and MF cases with (n = 19) or without (n = 87) CBL mutations. The differences between mutation positive and negative cases was not significant as determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Transforming activities of CBL mutants  We determined whether selected CBL variants had oncogenic activity by testing whether they could transform the interleukin-3 (IL-3)â€“dependent cell line 32D to growth factor independence in conjunction with overexpression of wild-type FLT3	 as has been described previously for R420Q.15 We found that S376F	 H398Y	 P417A	 and R420Q alone each conferred a degree of growth factor independence to 32D cells	 but this effect was considerably enhanced in 32Ds that overexpressed wild-type FLT3. In contrast	 wild-type CBL conferred no growth advantage either with or without FLT3 overexpression. The N454D change was not transforming	 indicating that it is probably a rare polymorphism or a pathogenetically unimportant passenger mutation (Figure 7). Reproducible differences in survival between the different mutants were seen	 as illustrated in Figure 8A.  Figure 7 Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpoint Figure 7 Transforming activity of CBL mutants. 32D cells or 32Ds overexpressing wild-type FLT3 were transfected with wild-type or mutant CBL constructs and assayed for IL-3 independent growth over 3 days.

The y-axis shows proliferation in arbitrary units as determined by MTS assay (Promega) and the x-axis time in days.

(A) Relative survival/proliferation of 32D cells expressing wild-type or mutant CBL constructs 48 hours after growth factor withdrawal as determined by MTS assay. (B) 32D cells expressing wild-type FLT3 and CBL constructs as indicated were transfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin and stimulated with FLT3 ligand. After lysis	 FLT3 was immunoprecipitated	 blotted	 and probed with anti-HA. Total blots for FLT3 AND CBL are also shown. Abrogation of E3 ubiquitin ligase activity  It has been shown that FLT3 physically associates with CBL and that	 upon ligand stimulation	 FLT3 is rapidly ubiquitinylated by wild-type but not R420Q CBL.15 We found that transforming activity correlated directly with the ubiquitin ligase activity of the CBL variants	 as assayed by their ability to transfer HA-tagged ubiquitin to FLT3 after stimulation with FLT3 ligand. The S376F	 H398Y	 P417A and R420Q mutants showed loss of ubiquitin ligase activity	 whereas N454D was comparable to wild-type CBL (Figure 8B).  Discussion  The initial aim of our study was to identify large regions of aUPD and therefore we undertook a relatively low resolution genome scan using 50k SNP arrays. Because we did not have constitutional DNA available from most of our cases	 we were not able to unambiguously determine whether the extended blocks of homozygosity that we observed were a consequence of aUPD	 constitutional UPD or autozygosity due to consaguinity	 however we used a very conservative definition of candidate aUPD regions (at least 20 Mb homozygous SNPs calls running to a telomere) and therefore expected that most or all would be acquired. We found that aUPD was relatively common in aCML	 but was uncommon in other MPNs that were negative for known mutations	 plus also CML blast crisis and CLL. Six distinct regions of aUPD were identified in aCML	 indicating substantial genetic heterogeneity in the genesis of this disorder. However	 we identified 2 recurrent regions of aUPD at 7q and 11q that were each seen in 10% of cases indicating the presence of common molecular abnormalities.  Our mutation screening focused primarily on tyrosine kinases and associated signal transduction components because of the known association between deregulated tyrosine kinase signaling and MPNs.3 Although we failed thus far to identify any abnormality on chromosome 7q	 we found missense CBL mutations in all three 11q aUPD cases. Screening of further MPNs revealed a total of 27 CBL variants in 26 patients who had been diagnosed with aCML (n = 12; 8%)	 MF (n = 3	 6%)	 CMML (n = 10	 13%)	 or HES/CEL (n = 1	 1%); that is	 morphologically and clinically related diseases that generally exhibit a poor prognosis. We were unable to discern	 however	 any specific clinical or prognostic features specifically associated with CBL mutated cases.  Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (CBL) is a well characterized protein that plays both positive and negative regulatory roles in tyrosine kinase signaling. In its positive role	 CBL binds to activated receptor tyrosine kinases via its N-terminal tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain and serves as an adaptor by recruiting downstream signal transduction components such as SHP2 and P13K. However the RING domain of CBL has E3 ligase activity and ubiquitinylates activated receptor tyrosine kinases on lysine residues	 a signal that triggers internalization of the receptor/ligand complex and subsequent recycling or degradation.21	24	25 CBL was originally identified after the characterization of v-Cbl	 the transforming component of the Cas NS-1 retrovirus	 and thus its association with neoplasia is well established26; however	 it is only very recently that CBL mutations were first identified in a human malignancy	 specifically occasional cases of AML.15	23	27 We have found that CBL mutations are much more common in MPNs	 and previous reports of 11q aUPD in MDS28 suggest that CBL mutations will also prove to be common in this disease. Indeed	 7 of 12 MDS cases with aUPD at 11q were recently shown to harbor CBL mutations.29 There are 2 other human CBL family members	 CBLB and CBLC	 but we did not identify aUPD in the regions containing these genes and did not detect any mutations of the linker/RING domain of CBLB.  We identified a total of 15 different CBL missense mutations affecting 12 residues (Table 2; Figure 3). Mutations of some of these residues (eg	 Y371	 C381	 H398 and W408) have been analyzed previously in a study that concluded that loss of E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and concomitant impairment of EGFR internalization by RING finger mutations was insufficient for oncogenicity	 as assayed in NIH3T3 cells. However mutations of key residues within the Î±-helix of the linker region abolished ubiquitin ligase activity and were transforming.30 Although the precise amino acid substitutions we identified were different from those studied	 we found that mutations in both the RING finger and linker regions conferred autonomous growth to 32D/wt-FLT3 cells	 consistent with a causal relationship to the MPN phenotype. The fact that one mutation (N454D) was not transforming emphasizes the importance of functional analysis to distinguish driver mutations from irrelevant passengers or infrequent polymorphisms.31 Notably	 this mutation was only weakly conserved between species	 in contrast to all other missense mutations that affected highly conserved residues and are therefore likely to be functionally significant.  Enhanced autonomous growth in the presence of CBL mutations and overexpression of wild-type FLT3 may simply reflect the paucity of receptor tyrosine kinase gene expression in 32D cells or	 alternatively	 may indicate that the mutants are only weakly transforming and require the cooperation of other events to give rise to clinically manifest disease. Consistent with the latter hypothesis	 we identified 2 cases in which CBL mutations were acquired during progression of a preexisting MPN (Figure 4). In both cases the identity of the cooperating change is unknown: although one presented with a (relatively low level) V617F JAK2 mutation	 this disappeared on progression to CBL L380P positive disease	 indicating that the 2 mutations must have arisen independently in different clones. This is reminiscent of the observation that the leukemic blasts of approximately half of V617F positive MPNs that evolve to AML are negative for the JAK2 mutation.32	33 It remains to be established	 however	 if CBL mutations are usually secondary events or whether the 2 cases we identified are exceptional.  Further evidence for the requirement for additional cooperating genetic events comes from published mouse studies in which neither complete CBL knockout nor heterozygous knockin of the RING finger inactivating mutant C379A (mouse C379 is equivalent to human C381) resulted in evidence of an MPN or other malignancy.34	35 However	 closer analysis revealed subtle hemopoietic perturbations that clearly relate to the pathogenesis of MPNs. Specifically	 hemopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from these animals were increased in number	 hyperresponsive to thrombopoietin and more potent than wild-type HSCs in repopulating the hemopoietic system. These effects were associated with increased STAT5 accumulation and phosphorylation.34	35 Hyperresponsiveness to growth factors and stem cell involvement are 2 of the cardinal features of MPNs. Furthermore	 the association between STAT5 activation and MPNs is well documented.36	37 While it is possible that overt hematologic disease might have been induced by a homozygous knockin mutant	 these findings suggest that CBL mutations may not be solely responsible for a full MPN phenotype.  The nature of any cooperating abnormalities remains largely obscure. Our results show that overexpression of a tyrosine kinase can cooperate with CBL mutants to promote transformation	 however we failed to identify any kinase that was consistently overexpressed in mutation positive cases by tyrosine kinase expression profiling (data not shown). One CBL mutation positive case	 however	 also tested positive for 7q UPD by SNP array	 suggesting that these 2 abnormalities may complement each other. A CBL mutation resulting in skipping of exon 8 has also been identified in a murine model of NUP98-HOXD13 on progression from MDS to AML	38 further corroborating the theory that acute leukemia arises from complementary mutations	 one of which inhibits differentiation	 and a second (in this case CBL) that enhances proliferation or inhibits apoptosis.  The fact that many CBL mutations are associated with aUPD strongly suggests that clones with homozygous mutations have a selective advantage over those that are heterozygous. This contrasts with the prevailing view that transforming CBL RING finger and linker region mutants act in a dominant negative fashion. Although it is conceivable that another	 unknown locus on 11q is the target of aUPD	 the finding of 1 case with a Y371H mutation and a stop codon on opposite alleles strongly suggests that homozygous CBL mutations do indeed confer a direct selective advantage. Because we did not screen the entire gene for mutations	 it is possible that other cases with heterozygous mutations may also be functionally homozygous due to premature stop codons on the other allele. Alternatively	 heterozygosity in these cases may only be apparent due to variable proportions of background normal cells that are not part of the malignant clone. Although the nontransforming N454D mutant was heterozygous	 2 cases with heterozygous R420Q were observed and thus absence of homozygosity cannot be used to infer the presence of an irrelevant	 nontransforming sequence variant.  In summary	 we have found that oncogenic CBL mutations are acquired in a subset of hematologically related	 poor prognosis MPNs. Our findings further strengthen the notion that MPNs are primarily â€œtyrosine kinopathies	â€ that is	 diseases caused by aberrant activation of proliferation and survival pathways as a consequence of mutations that either directly or indirectly promote excess tyrosine kinase signaling. In view of the fact that tyrosine kinases are such good drug targets	 the possibility that CBL-mutated cases might be amenable to therapeutic inhibition is clearly attractive.  Somatic mutations of Kit have been found in leukemias and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. The proto-oncogene c-Cbl negatively regulates Kit and Flt3 by its E3 ligase activity and acts as a scaffold. We recently identified the first c-Cbl mutation in human disease in an acute myeloid leukemia patient	 called Cbl-R420Q. Here we analyzed the role of Cbl mutants on Kit-mediated transformation. Coexpression of Cbl-R420Q or Cbl-70Z with Kit induced cytokine-independent proliferation	 survival	 and clonogenic growth. Primary murine bone marrow retrovirally transduced with c-Cbl mutants and transplanted into mice led to a generalized mastocytosis	 a myeloproliferative disease	 and myeloid leukemia. Overexpression of these Cbl mutants inhibited stem cell factor (SCF)â€“induced ubiquitination and internalization of Kit. Both Cbl mutants enhanced the basal activation of Akt and prolonged the ligand-dependent activation. Importantly	 transformation was observed also with kinase-dead forms of Kit and Flt3 in the presence of Cbl-70Z	 but not in the absence of Kit or Flt3	 suggesting a mechanism dependent on receptor tyrosine kinases	 but independent of their kinase activity. Instead	 transformation depends on the Src family kinase Fyn	 as c-Cbl coimmunoprecipitated with Fyn and inhibition abolished transformation. These findings may explain primary resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeted at receptor tyrosine kinases. (Blood. 2009;114:4197-4208) Introduction Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) play a pivotal role in embryonic development and in hematopoiesis. Extracellular binding of a ligand to its respective RTK induces dimerization followed by intracellular signaling.1 The amplitude and duration of RTK signaling are tightly controlled; termination of RTK signaling occurs by receptor ubiquitination	 internalization	 and degradation.2-4 Ubiquitination requires an E3 ubiquitin ligase	 which leads to the covalent attachment of the ubiquitin molecule to the target protein.5	6 Cbl proteins are RING domain-based E3 ligases with 3 mammalian homologs; c-Cbl	 Cbl-b	7 and Cbl-c.8 c-Cbl consists of a tyrosine kinase binding domain	 a linker domain	 a RING finger	 a proline-rich region	 and finally a ubiquitin-associated domain overlapping with a leucine zipper motif.9 The highly conserved Cbl RING finger domain possesses E3 ligase activity and recruits E2 enzymes for the transfer of ubiquitin to substrates.10-12 It has been shown that Cbl directs monoubiquitination and polyubiquitination on multiple sites of RTKs	 for example	 for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)	 which then leads to internalization and degradation in the lysosomes.2	13	14 Mutations in either the tyrosine kinase binding domain	 linker	 or RING finger domain of Cbl result in dysregulation of RTKs.15-17 Most of these mutants are thought to act in a dominant-negative manner by competing with the wild-type receptor. V-Cbl	 a mutant form of Cbl	 has been found in Cas NS-1 retrovirus as a fusion protein. It lacks the C-terminus part of wild-type c-Cbl and can induce preâ€“B-cell lymphomas and leukemia in mice.18 Cbl-70Z is a 17-amino acid deletion mutant (at the boundary of the linker and RING finger domain) isolated from 70Z/3 mouse preâ€“B-cell lymphoma.17 We recently identified the first c-Cbl oncogenic mutation in human disease in an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient	 called Cbl-R420Q	 and analyzed the role of this Cbl mutant in Flt3 signaling.19 Cbl-R420Q and Cbl-70Z were able to confer interleukin-3 (IL-3)â€“independent growth to the 32Dcl3 cell line in the presence of wild-type Flt3 receptor.19 Subsequently	 several other Cbl mutations were found in AML patients.20-24 Cbl proteins are not only important for RTK signal termination; they also mediate positive RTK signaling events to downstream effectors. Cbl has been shown to bind to signaling molecules	 including the Src family kinases.25	26 Cbl has also been shown to bind to several RTKs	 including the Kit receptor. Kit is a member of class III RTK family	 structurally related to PDGFR	 having 5 immunoglobulin-like domains	 a single transmembrane helix	 a cytoplasmic juxtamembrane domain	 and split kinase domain.27-29 Gain-of-function mutations in Kit can lead to a malignant disease	 including gastrointestinal stromal tumors and leukemia.27	30	31 In AML	 Kit involves mutations at residue 816	 which is encoded by exon 17.32-34 Cbl binds to Submitted November 30	 2008; accepted July 12	 2009.

Kit directly35 and indirectly via Grb2.36 Cbl is known to be phosphorylated by Src family kinases (SFKs)37	38 and mediates ubiquitination35 of the Kit receptor on activation. The role of Cbl in Kit signaling in the context of leukemia is not well understood. Here	 we found that mutant Cbl proteins	 Cbl-R420Q and Cbl-70Z	 displayed in vitro transforming activity for myeloid cells that was dependent on the presence of Kit. These Cbl mutants altered internalization	 ubiquitination	 and downstream signaling of the Kit receptor. Surprisingly	 we found that kinase activity of Kit and Flt3 was not required for the transformation of Cbl-70Z. We were able to show the contribution of Src family kinases for this synergistic transformation of Cbl-70Z and kinase-dead (KD) forms of Kit and Flt3. These data suggest a kinase-independent role of Kit and Flt3 for Cbl-dependent cellular functions. Retroviral expression of Cbl mutants in transplanted bone marrow induced a generalized mastocytosis	 a myeloproliferative disease and	 in rare care cases	 myeloid leukemia. To our knowledge	 this is the first report of an in vivo model investigating the role of Cbl mutations in malignant transformation. These results point toward their critical role in preventing RTK signaling termination.

The PI3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Cell lines The 32Dcl3 and COS-7 cell lines were cultured as described previously.19 To generate stable cell lines	 32D cells were electroporated with 10  g of pAL Kit-WT	 pAL Kit-D790N (Kit-KD)	 or pAL Flt3-K644A (Flt3-KD) together with 1  g of pMAM/BSD (Kaken Pharmaceutical) as selection marker in 0.4-cm cuvettes at 280 V and 975  F. Cells were selected with 15  g/mL blasticidin (Invitrogen) in IL-3â€“supplemented culture. Later these cells were infected with retroviral supernatants of pMY Cbl-R420Q	 pMY Cbl-70Z	 or pMY (empty vector). Transduced cells were sorted with the help of green fluorescent protein marker using flow cytometry. To avoid possible clonal selection	 at least 2 bulk cultures were generated for each cell line. All cell lines were maintained as previously described.19 Retrovirus preparation Platinum-E ecotropic packaging cells39 and NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Platinum-E cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)	 and retroviral stocks were collected twice at 12-hour intervals beginning 24 hours after transfection. Retrovirus was titered by transduction of 5  104 NIH3T3 cells with serial dilutions of retrovirus in the presence of 4  g/mL polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich). Percentage of infected cells was determined by flow cytometric analysis of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression after 48 hours. The titer was calculated and tested for the presence of replication-competent viral particles by transferring supernatant onto NIH3T3 cells. The NIH3T3 cells were subsequently analyzed for EGFP expression by fluorescenceactivated cell scanner (FACS) analysis. Transduction and transplantation of murine bone marrow Murine bone marrow was harvested from female Balb/C donor mice 4 days after injection of 150 mg/kg 5-fluorouracil (Ribosepharm) and prestimulated overnight in Iscove modified Dulbecco medium/20% FCS supplemented with growth factors (10 ng/mL murine IL-3 [mIL-3]	 10 ng/mL mIL-6	 50 ng/mL mSCF). Cells were transduced by 4 rounds of spin infection (1200g	 32Â°C	 90 minutes) every 12 hours in retroviral supernatant supplemented with growth factors and 4  g/mL polybrene (SigmaAldrich). Retroviral experiments were performed using the murine stem cell virus-based retroviral construct pMY.40 Subsequently	 cells were resuspended in Hanks balanced salt solution (Sigma-Aldrich) and injected into the tail vein of lethally irradiated (8 Gy) female Balb/C recipient mice. Transplanted animals were monitored for signs of disease development and by serial measurement of peripheral blood counts. All procedures were reviewed and approved by the University of Frankfurt supervisory animal care committee. Flow cytometric immunophenotyping (FACS analysis) Single-cell suspensions of indicated tissue samples were prepared	 and red blood cells of peripheral blood were lysed before analysis. Cells were subsequently stained with PE-conjugated anti-CD117 (Kit)	 anti-CD11b (Mac-1)	 antiâ€“Gr-1	 anti-CD45R/B220	 or anti-CD3 antibodies. All antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences PharMingen. Ubiquitination assays and immunoprecipitations COS-7 cells were transfected transiently with the indicated constructs together with a plasmid for HA-tagged ubiquitin (Ubq) using Nanofectin according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. At 48 hours after transfection	 cells were serum starved for 12 hours and then stimulated with 50 ng/mL SCF for 10 minutes. Cells were lysed as described before.19 For immunoprecipitation	 cell lysates were incubated with goat polyclonal antibody against murine Kit and with protein A/G-Plus-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times with lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitates as well as total lysates were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfateâ€“polyacrylamide gel electrophoreses (SDS-PAGE) and probed with anti-HA (anti-Ubq) or anti-Kit antibodies. Immunoprecipitations and Western blot analyses were performed as described previously.19 Analysis of cell growth The 32D cells expressing the indicated constructs were washed twice and resuspended in RPMI 1640 with 10% FCS alone or supplemented with the indicated growth factors or with inhibitors at 2  105 cells/mL. Viable cells were determined by trypan blue exclusion and were counted daily. 3[H]-thymidine incorporation A total of 3  104 cells were starved from IL-3 in 10% FCS for 12 hours	 subsequently placed in the presence of indicated cytokines	 nothing	 or either 15  M of PP-1 or PP-2. After 6 hours of incubation at 37Â°C with 5% CO2	 0.037 MBq (1  Ci)3[H]-thymidine was added to each well	 cells were harvested after incubation of 15 hours	 and DNA was analyzed with scintillation counter. Experiments were repeated at least 3 times. Site-directed mutagenesis To generate Kit KD (Kit-D790N)	 aspartic acid 790 of Kit-WT was replaced with asparagine (confirmed by sequencing)	 using mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). 4198 BANDI et al BLOOD	 5 NOVEMBER 2009   VOLUME 114	 NUMBER 19 From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 28	 2017.

Internalization assays Internalization assay was as described before19; briefly	 32D or COS-7 (5  105) cells expressing indicated constructs were incubated with SCF for the indicated time points. Internalization of the receptor was stopped by adding ice-cold PBS containing 0.4% sodium azide. After washing	 the cells were stained with PE-labeled anti-Kit antibody and fluorescence intensity was analyzed by flow cytometry. Clonal growth in methylcellulose Clonal growth was performed as described previously.41 Briefly	 stably transfected 32D cells expressing Kit-WT or Kit-KD with the indicated Cbl constructs were seeded at a concentration of 103 cells/dish in the absence of any growth factors. The assays were plated as triplicates	 and colonies were photographed and counted on day 6. Results Cbl mutants (Cbl-R420Q and Cbl-70Z) confer ligand-independent growth in cooperation with Kit Recently	 we published the role of 2 dominant-negative Cbl mutants	 Cbl-R420Q and Cbl-70Z	 in Flt3 signaling.19 Because early hematopoietic stem cells and leukemic progenitor cells express high levels of the Kit receptor tyrosine kinase	 we were interested to analyze whether dominant-negative Cbl proteins would synergize with this receptor. First	 we generated IL-3â€“ dependent 32D cell lines stably expressing Kit (Kit-WT) and/or Cbl mutants and analyzed proliferation and viability in the presence or absence of the Kit ligand SCF. Interestingly	 cells expressing either Cbl mutant in the presence of Kit-WT rapidly proliferated in the absence of exogenous SCF or IL-3 (Figure 1A). However	 in the absence of Cbl mutants	 cells coexpressing Kit-WT alone proliferated only in the presence of SCF (data not shown). Proliferation was more pronounced in the cells coexpressing Cbl-70Z and Kit-WT compared with cells coexpressing Cbl-R420Q and Kit-WT. Cultures expressing one of the Cbl mutants with Kit-WT survived for extended time periods in the absence of any growth factors (Figure 1B). Importantly	 32D cells expressing either of the Cbl mutants or Kit-WT alone were not able to proliferate ligand-independently and survived for a shorter duration (Figure 1B). Finally	 we analyzed the effect of Cbl mutants on IL-3â€“ independent and SCF-dependent proliferation in3[H]-thymidine incorporation assays. Coexpression of Cbl mutants with Kit-WT induced a pronounced proliferative growth advantage in the absence of SCF	 and this growth was further enhanced after SCF stimulation (Figure 1C). Neither Cbl-R420Qâ€“ nor Kit-WTâ€“ expressing cells led to SCF-independent growth. Cells expressing Cbl-70Z alone showed a moderate growth advantage	42 which was only for a short duration (Figure 1A-B). Coexpression of Cbl-WT with Kit-WT did not show any effect on proliferation (data not shown). To further investigate the transforming potential of the 2 mutant Cbl proteins	 we examined their ability to confer clonogenic Figure 1.

For personal use only. growth to 32D cells (Figure 1D-E). When expressed in 32D cells	 Cbl-70Z induced the formation of very few	 small colonies in the absence of growth factors (Figure 1D-E). In contrast	 expression of Cbl mutants together with Kit induced the growth of numerous large and dispersed colonies (Figure 1E). Cbl mutants induce a generalized mastocytosis and a myeloproliferative disease in a murine bone marrow transplantation model To investigate the transforming capability of different Cbl mutants in vivo	 we generated murine ecotropic retrovirus (pMY) expressing Cbl-R420Q	 Cbl-70Z	 or empty vector. We used a bicistronic retroviral vector coexpressing the Cbl mutants together with the EGFP via an internal ribosomal entry site.40 Bone marrow was transduced with each retrovirus at a titer of 4  105 retroviral particles per milliliter and analyzed by flow cytometry for EGFP expression	 and the total cell number was determined. A total of 150 000 EGFP cells was injected into the tail vein of lethally irradiated (8 Gy) female Balb/C recipient mice. Initial control experiments showed a similar level of expression between CblR420Q and Cbl-70Z (data not shown). Almost all recipients of bone marrow cells transduced with Cbl mutants developed a lethal hematologic disorder with a mean latency of 341 days in the Cbl-R420Q group and 395 days in the Cbl-70Z group (Figure 2A	C). Eleven of 13 mice in the Cbl-R420Q group and 8 of 11 mice in the Cbl-70Z group died. Two animals in the Cbl-R420Q group died of a â€œmyeloid leukemia with maturation	â€ matching all 5 criteria for nonlymphoid leukemia of the Bethesda proposals.43 These 2 mice showed leukocytosis of up to 140 000/ L (supplemental Figure 1B	 available on the Blood website; see the Supplemental Materials link at the top of the online article) with more than 20% blasts in the peripheral blood (supplemental Figure1A) and up to 70% blast infiltration in the spleen (Figure 3). Splenomegaly (Figure 2B-D) developed with large differences in spleen weights (Figure 2D) and expansion of myeloid cells in liver and spleen were observed (Figure 3). Histology sections of spleen	 liver	 and bone marrow and FACS analyses of spleen	 bone marrow	 and peripheral blood showed extensive infiltration of blasts and mature myeloid cells (Figures 2E	 3; supplemental Figure 1D). Importantly	 all the animals in the Cbl-R420Q and Cbl-70Z group showed a diffuse organ infiltration (spleen	 liver	 bone marrow	 lung	 kidney	 heart) of mast cells with a very variable range of mast cell infiltration (Figure 3; supplemental Figure 2A). Six mice showed massive mast cell infiltration	 reminiscent of mast cell sarcoma. These cells have clear mast cell morphology with numerous granules in Giemsa staining and are highly positive in naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase (NACE) staining. The lesions have characteristic cytology with uniform	 closely packed cells with round nuclei and clear	 abundant cytoplasm with granules	 which are characteristic features of mast cells (Figure 3; supplemental Figure 2B-C). One mouse had an organ infiltration of mast cells together with mature myeloid cells and 5% to 10% myeloid blast cells. Importantly	 none of the control mice had histologic evidence of mastocytosis or other hematologic disease. Figure 2.

Thus	 bone marrow transplantation of cells expressing Cbl mutants led to a generalized mastocytosis (in extreme cases mast cell sarcoma)	 a myeloproliferative disorder	 and myeloid leukemia with a long latency and at high penetrance. Cbl mutants inhibit ubiquitination and internalization of ligand-activated Kit The observation that Flt3 and Kit proteins cooperated with Cbl mutants to transform myeloid cells in vitro and in vivo prompted us to study the underlying mechanisms. First	 we analyzed the physical interaction between the Cbl and Kit proteins. Immunoprecipitation of overexpressed HA-tagged c-Cbl resulted in immunocomplexes that also contained Kit (Figure 4A). The association of Cbl mutants with Kit was enhanced by the presence of SCF. A consistent association of Cbl-70Z with Kit receptor was noticed in the absence of ligand (Figure 4A). Under physiologic conditions	 ligand activation of RTKs induces receptor internalization and degradation	 which are important for RTK signal mitigation. Cbl proteins play an important role in these processes.9	44	45 Therefore	 we analyzed whether Cbl mutants could abolish ubiquitination of the activated Kit receptor. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with Kit-WT and HAtagged Ubq in the presence or absence of Cbl mutants to study the ubiquitination. Kit was effectively ubiquitinated in the presence of endogenous Cbl after stimulation with SCF (Figure 4B)	 but the presence of Cbl-R420Q completely abolished ubiquitination of the activated receptor. Cbl-70Z also repressed ubiquitination	 but not to the same extent as Cbl-R420Q. The expression of the Kit receptor and the Cbl mutants was similar in all the cases. As ubiquitination often leads to endocytosis of the activated receptor	2-4 we examined the effect of Cbl mutants on endocytosis of activated Kit receptor in 32D and COS-7 cells to avoid cell typeâ€“specific effects on endocytosis. Cells transfected with Kit-WT in the presence or absence of Cbl mutants were stimulated with SCF	 and the amount of Kit receptor at the surface was analyzed by FACS at the indicated time points. Cbl mutants quite effectively inhibited the initial rapid rate of ligand-induced receptor internalization (Figure 4C; supplemental Figure 3A). Figure 3. Cbl mutants induce a myeloid leukemia or mast cell sarcoma. Histopathology of the bone marrow (BM)	 liver	 and spleen from mice transplanted with Cbl mutant-transduced bone marrow cells. Spleen	 liver	 and bone marrow sections (hematoxylin and eosin [HE]	 Giemsa	 NACE; original magnifications	 100-1000) from a representative leukemic mouse (Cbl-R420Q) and a mouse with mast cell sarcoma (Cbl-70Z)	 which received bone marrow cells transduced with Cbl-R420Q or Cbl-70Z	 respectively. Normal organ architecture is visible in a control mouse. The leukemic mouse (CblR420Q) reveals a massive infiltration of immature myeloid cells with its maximum in the spleen and consecutive destruction of the normal organ structure. There are also mast cells sporadically visible in between the immature cell infiltration (arrow in the spleen pictures and Giemsa staining). In contrast	 mast cells in the mice with mast-cell sarcoma have characteristic cytology with uniform	 closely packed cells with round nuclei and clear	 abundant cytoplasm with granules and the typical features of mast cells with numerous granules in Giemsa staining and are highly positive in NACE staining.

Cbl mutants alter signal quality after ligand stimulation of Kit We then analyzed the effects of Cbl mutants on the quality	 amplitude	 and duration of Kit signaling (Figure 4D-H). Coexpression of Cbl-70Z or Cbl-R420Q with Kit receptors induced a stronger activation of the Akt and Erk pathways as indicated by phosphorylation of the respective signaling intermediates after 10 minutes (Figure 4E). Furthermore	 Akt and	 to a lesser extent	 Erk were phosphorylated (ie	 activated) even in the absence of growth factors (Figure 4E). No activation of intracellular signaling mediators was observed when the Cbl mutants were overexpressed alone (Figure 4D). In time course experiments	 we observed a prolonged activation of Kit	 Akt	 and Erk activity up to 240 minutes after SCF stimulation in cells expressing Cbl-70Z or Cbl-R420Q (Figure 4F-H). In addition	 Cbl-70Z expression led to autophosphorylation of the Kit receptor in the absence of any ligand (Figure 4F). Kinase activity of Kit and Flt3 is dispensable for Cbl-70Zâ€“mediated transformation To elucidate the mechanism of transformation by Cbl mutants and Kit receptor	 we generated 32D cells stably expressing KD mutants of Kit (Kit-D790N	 Kit-KD) in the presence or absence of Cbl mutants. Analyzing the proliferative capacity of cells that coexpressed Kit-KD and Cbl-R420Q	 we surprisingly found a subtle growth and survival advantage compared with Kit-KD alone (Figure 5A-B). This effect was more pronounced with Cbl-70Z. Interestingly	 cells coexpressing Kit-KD and Cbl-70Z rapidly Figure 4. Cbl mutants bind to Kit	 inhibit ubiquitination and endocytosis	 and potentiate Kit-induced signaling. (A) Kit physically interacts with c-Cbl. 32D-Kit-WT cells stably transfected with HA-tagged Cbl proteins (Cbl-WT	 Cbl-R420Q	 and Cbl-70Z) were deprived from cytokines overnight and subsequently exposed to the indicated cytokines for 10 minutes. Cbl proteins were immunoprecipitated by anti-HA antibodies	 and immunoprecipitates were resolved on SDS-PAGE. Coimmunoprecipitation of Kit was analyzed using anti-Kit antibodies. (B) Cbl mutants inhibit ubiquitination of Kit. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with the indicated constructs together with a plasmid for HA-tagged Ubq. After 48 hours of transfection	 cells were serum-starved for 12 hours and stimulated with 50 ng/mL SCF for 10 minutes or left unstimulated. Cell lysates were prepared and equal amounts of lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-Kit antibody. The immunoprecipitates were resolved on SDS-PAGE and analyzed with anti-HA or anti-Kit antibodies. Expression of overexpressed Cbl mutants is shown in total cell lysates (TCLs) using anti-Cbl antibody. (C) Internalization of Kit is inhibited by Cbl mutants. The 32D cells stably expressing Kit in the presence or absence of different Cbl mutants were washed with PBS and then stimulated with SCF for the indicated time points. Subsequently	 the amount of Kit remained on the cell surface was measured by flow cytometry after staining with a PE-labeled anti-Kit antibody. Sodium azide was used to stop the internalization. Results are expressed as mean   SD of 3 independent experiments. (D-E) Cbl influences Kit-mediated signaling.

Western blot analyses using phospho-specific antibodies for Kit (F)	 Akt (G)	 and Erk1/2 (H) were performed. 4202 BANDI et al BLOOD	 5 NOVEMBER 2009   VOLUME 114	 NUMBER 19 From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 28	 2017. For personal use only. proliferated and survived for extended time periods in the absence of exogenous growth factors (Figure 5B-C). We generated 32D cells that expressed KD Flt3 (Flt3-K644A	 Flt3-KD) in the presence and absence of Cbl mutants. Interestingly	 cells coexpressing Flt3-KD and Cbl-70Z also proliferated and survived growth factor independently (Figure 5D-F). We confirmed in viability assays (data not shown) and 3[H]-thymidine incorporation assays that both KD receptors were not responsive to their respective ligand (Figure 5C	F). To find out the signaling molecules supporting this transforming effect of Cbl-70Z	 we examined Akt	 Erk	 and Stat pathways in 32D cell lines coexpressing Kit-KD or Flt3-KD and Cbl mutants. Surprisingly	 we found ligand-independent activation of Akt only in the cells overexpressing Cbl-70Z in the presence of either of the KD receptors	 but not in the cells overexpressing Cbl-R420Q or in the control cells (Figure 6B; supplemental Figure 3D). There were no differences in Erk or Stat5 activation (Figure 6B). Importantly	 inhibition of Akt activity by its respective inhibitor abolished the cytokine-independent growth of these cells (Figure 6D). The presence of Cbl-70Z conferred ligand-independent autophosphorylation to Kit-WT (Figures 4F	 6A)	 but we were not able to detect autophosphorylated KD receptors in the absence or presence of any dominant-negative Cbl mutant (Figure 6A). Furthermore	 we analyzed the turnover of the KD Kit receptor by ubiquitination experiments	 to understand the basic mechanism of degradation of this receptor. Interestingly	 we did not observe basic levels of ubiquitination of the receptor	 compared with the basic level of the unstimulated Kit-WT receptor (Figure 6C). Taken together	 Cbl- 70Z and Cbl-R420Q not only strongly synergized with unstimulated receptor tyrosine kinases with intact kinase function	 but surprisingly also induce biologically meaningful signaling events emanating from kinase-inactive class III receptor tyrosine kinases. SFKs are necessary for Cbl-70Zâ€“mediated transformation SFKs play an important role in intracellular signaling processes	 for example	 of cytokine receptors	 which do not have tyrosine kinase activity.46	47 Because we had observed RTK activity-independent proliferation in cells overexpressing RTKs and Cbl mutants	 we speculated whether SFKs could play a role in Cbl-70Zâ€“mediated transformation. First	 we analyzed the SFKs activation status in the presence of Cbl mutants. In 32D cells	 we observed that some SFKs were already constitutively active in the absence of any growth factors; this activation was not further enhanced by IL-3 stimulation but was strongly enhanced in the presence of both Cbl mutants (data not shown). In addition	 the overexpression of Kit in the presence of Cbl mutants showed a similar phosphorylation of SFKs irrespective of the kinase activity of the RTK (Figure 7A). Next	 we examined the binding of Kit-KD	 Cbl proteins	 and SFKs. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed a constitutive association between phosphorylated SFKs and Cbl proteins in the absence of Kit (Figure 7B left panel). Surprisingly	 immunoprecipitation of Cbl mutants resulted also in immunocomplexes with Kit-KD (Figure 7B right panel). Differences in the expression levels of Cbl mutants can be excluded as reason for the different phenotypical behavior of these mutants (Figure 7B; and data not shown). The association Figure 5. Kinase activity of Kit and Flt3 is dispensable for Cbl-70Zâ€“mediated transformation.

For personal use only. of Cbl mutants with Kit-KD was not enhanced by the presence of SCF. However Cbl mutants associated with KD Kit receptor	 which could be a prerequisite for the transformation potential of Kit-KD together with Cbl mutants. To test this hypothesis	 we used the well-established Src family inhibitors PP-1 and PP-2 and the more clinically relevant inhibitor dasatinib.48	49 Here	 the phosphorylation of SFKs was completely inhibited in the presence of all Src inhibitors (supplemental Figure 3B). In addition	 PP-2 completely abrogated the interaction between activated SFKs and Cbl (Figure 7C). We checked which SFKs were expressed in 32D cells and defined their binding to Cbl. By immunoprecipitation	 we showed that Fyn binds to Cbl in a phosphorylation-dependent manner	 but not Lck	 Hck	 Src	 Yes	 and Lyn (Figure 7D; and data not shown). Consistently	 we observed in proliferation assays that cells coexpressing Kit-KD or Flt3-KD together with Cbl-70Z were unable to grow in the presence of PP-1 or PP-2 (Figure 7F). Next	 we investigated the effect of the Src inhibitors on the clonogenic growth mediated by Cbl mutants. Importantly	 the presence of Src inhibitor PP-2 significantly inhibited the clonogenic growth in the presence of Cbl mutants and Kit or Flt3 receptor (Figure 7G). It was of interest whether the constitutive Akt activation in cells coexpressing Kit-KD and Cbl-70Z was also suppressed by Src inhibitors. We hypothesized that SFKs might be activating the PI3K pathway either directly or by phosphorylating Cbl at tyrosine 731 (Y731)	 which is known to be the PI3K binding site.9 Dasatinib and PP-2 completely inhibited Akt activation and Cbl phosphorylation at Y731 (Figure 7E; supplemental Figure 3C)	 suggesting that SFKs are upstream of Akt and are critically involved in Cbl-70Zmediated synergistic transformation. Finally	 we used imatinib (inhibitor of Kit) and dasatinib (inhibitor of Kit and SFKs)49 to demonstrate the growth and survival mediated by Cbl mutants in the absence of Kit kinase activity. As shown in Figure 7H	 dasatinib strongly inhibited the proliferation of Kit-WT (or Kit-KD) cells overexpressing Cbl-70Z	 whereas imatinib reduced proliferation to a much lesser extent	 most probably because imatinib does not inhibit SFKs. Discussion The RTKs Flt3 and Kit play an important role in leukemogenesis.50-52 Approximately 25% of all AML patients carry mutations in Flt3	 whereas Kit mutations are found less frequently. Kit mutations have been preferentially associated with the corebinding factor leukemias.53 Activating mutations of Flt3 (such as Flt3-ITD and activating point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain	 Flt3-TKD) and Kit lead to aberrant signal transduction and have spurred considerable interest in the development of specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors for these RTKs.34	52	53 Recently	 we identified a c-Cbl mutation in an AML patient	 which leads to a defective E3 ligase activity. This was the first Cbl mutation identified in human disease.19 Several more additional mutations were subsequently found in c-Cbl and Cbl-b	20-24 suggesting that Cbl mutations are recurring events in AML. Cbl mutations probably occur in other hematologic and solid tumors as well. Cbl has been shown to degrade several RTKs	 including the EGFR and PDGFR.9	26	54	55 Recently	 we showed that Flt3 is degraded in a Cbl-dependent manner.19 As shown here	 the expression of Kit in myeloid 32D cells does not lead to cytokineindependent growth. However	 in the presence of Cbl-R420Q or Cbl-70Z	 Kit expression promotes cytokine-independent growth (Figure 1A). This effect can be enhanced after SCF stimulation. Similarly	 coexpression of Kit with either Cbl-R420Q or Cbl-70Z promotes survival (Figure 1B) and proliferation (Figure 1C). In addition	 coexpression of Kit and either of the Cbl mutants led to colony growth in the absence of growth factors (Figure 1D-E). We observed similar effects with Flt3	19 suggesting that this may be a general mechanism in most RTKs. Figure 6. Cbl mutants are in part restoring KD Kit-mediated signaling. (A-B) Constitutive Akt activation in Kit-KD cells expressing Cbl-70Z. The 32D cells with Kit-WT or Kit-KD were engineered to express the indicated Cbl proteins	 deprived from cytokines overnight	 and subsequently exposed to the indicated cytokines for 10 minutes. Western blot analyses with the indicated antibodies were performed. (C) Kit-KD is not ubiquitylated. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with the indicated constructs together with a plasmid for HA-tagged ubiquitin. After 48 hours of transfection	 cells were serum starved for 12 hours and stimulated with 50 ng/ mL SCF for 10 minutes or left unstimulated. Cell lysates were prepared	 and equal amounts of lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-Kit antibody. The immunoprecipitates were resolved on SDS-PAGE and analyzed with anti-HA or anti-Kit antibodies. (D) Proliferation of Kit-KD cells expressing Cbl-70Z is dependent on Akt activation.

BLOOD	 5 NOVEMBER 2009   VOLUME 114	 NUMBER 19 Cbl MUTATIONS IN MYELOID TRANSFORMATION 4205 From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 28	 2017. For personal use only. In a murine bone marrow transplantation model	 we observed 2 distinct diseases with high penetrance and long latency (Figures 2-3): a generalized mastocytosis and a myeloproliferative disease. In addition	 2 mice developed a myeloid leukemia with high leukocyte counts	 splenomegaly	 and organ infiltration by myeloid immature cells (Figure 3). Six mice developed mast cell sarcomas. A tantalizing explanation for the massive mast cell proliferation could be the typical expression of Kit in these cells. In our opinion	 the long latency is very suggestive of secondary events (mutations	 epigenetic changes) occurring. These may occur in different animals	 at different times with different rates	 explaining the variability of disease onset and death. Postmortem analysis of Cbl expression was not performed	 as endogenous Cbl is widely expressed. As the Cbl mutants affect the stability of several intracellular and surface molecules	 including Flt3 and Kit in these in vivo experiments	 we were unable to pinpoint the contribution of the Cbl targets to the disease phenotype. Although unproven	 the similarity of Cbl-70Z and Cbl-R420Q in disease development suggests a similar mechanism for both mutants. A recent report showed that hematopoietic stem cells from Cbl /  mice have an increased pool size	 are hyperproliferative	 and show enhanced long-term repopulating capacity.56 It is tempting to speculate that Cbl-inactivating mutations may promote similar function in leukemiainitiating cells. Importantly	 Cbl /  hematopoietic stem cells expanded more in the presence of SCF and thrombopoietin	 which is explained by the fact that Cbl is the negative regulator of Kit and the thrombopoietin receptor (cMpl) and supports the validity of increased SCF responsiveness we observed in cells coexpressing Kit and Cbl mutants (Figure 1C). NUP98-HOXD13 (NHD13) fusion gene plays an important role in myelodysplastic syndrome and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. Recently	 an acquired Cbl mutation was shown in a Nup98-HoxD13 mouse model	 which strongly supports the prominent role of Cbl mutations in vivo.57 To our knowledge	 the in vivo data presented in Figures 2 and 3 are the first in vivo evidence that a Cbl mutant identified from human malignancy is involved in disease pathogenesis. The minor differences observed between Cbl-R420Q and Cbl-70Z are within the variability of animal experimentation that we and others have observed. It is well established that an intact RING domain is required for the E3 ligase activity of Cbl.58	59 Cbl-70Z and Cbl-R420Q have a disrupted RING domain and are E3 ligase defective.19 Cbl-R420Q and Cbl-70Z therefore prevent ubiquitination and endocytosis of Kit (Figure 4B-C). We were interested to further clarify the mechanisms of transformation by Cbl mutants and performed a careful analysis of the signaling properties conferred by Kit in the presence or absence of Cbl mutants. These experiments revealed enhanced basal RTK autophosphorylation and prolonged ligandactivated MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling in the cells expressing Cbl mutants and Kit (Figure 4F-H)	 which is in line with published data for EGFR	60 PDGFR	 61 and Flt3.19 However	 we also observed basal activation of Akt and Erk (Figure 4E-H)	 which contrasts with data for Flt3	 where no differences in Akt basal signaling were identified.19 The reasons for this difference are unknown but may be the result of differences in Kit and Flt3 expression. In any case	 as Akt activation has been shown to cause cytokine-independent colony growth	62 this may partly explain why coexpression of Cbl mutants with Kit (in the absence of ligand) led to colony growth (Figure 1D). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that Cbl mutants are part of a complex with Kit after ligand stimulation (Figure 4A). Importantly	 Cbl-70Z (and to a lesser extent Cbl-R420Q) coimmunoprecipitated with Kit in the absence of ligand. This suggests a constitutive complex formation between Cbl mutants and Kit (Figure 4A)	 which was similarly observed for EGFR60 and Flt3.19 Our data reveal functional differences between Cbl-70Z and Cbl-R420Q. The loss of E3 ligase activity is more pronounced in cells expressing Cbl-R420Q than in those expressing Cbl-70Z (Figure 4B)	 whereas the consequences of expression of either Cbl mutant appear to be very similar in both the in vitro and in vivo experiments with primary murine bone marrow (Figures 2-3). However	 the biologic consequences of Cbl-70Z are more dramatic in cell culture experiments performed in 32D cells (Figures 1	 5-6). Further studies are necessary to decipher these differences between Cbl mutants	 including the novel mutations that have been described since our initial observation20-24 and have not yet been molecularly characterized. However	 it is possible that conformational changes or differences in subcellular localization are involved. We were interested in defining the kinase requirements of the Cbl mutants/RTK interaction. Importantly	 although our data revealed that the biologic functions mediated by Kit and Cbl-70Z were in large part dependent on the receptor kinase activity	 we observed a small but biologically dominant effect also of kinaseinactive Kit and Flt3 on cells expressing Cbl mutants (Figure 5). Although it was not sufficient for cytokine-independent growth that the cells expressed Cbl-70Z	 KD Kit (Figure 5A-C)	 and Flt3 (Figure 5D-F) synergized with Cbl mutants. It could be speculated that Kit or Flt3	 which can be found to be in complex with the Cbl proteins	 may act as a necessary scaffold. This is in line with a recent report that survival of cancer cells was maintained by EGFR independently of its kinase activity.63 The yet unimpressive clinical outcomes of tyrosine kinase inhibitors for treatment of multiple types of cancer suggest that kinase-independent functions of RTKs may be a significant contributor for cancer progression. Biochemical analysis demonstrated neither autophosphorylation (or ligand-dependent phosphorylation) of Kit-KD (Figure 6A) nor downstream Erk or Stat5 activation (Figure 6B). Similarly	 Kit-KD was not ubiquitinated in response to SCF (Figure 6C). Finally	 constitutive Akt activation seems to play an important role in cells expressing Kit-KD and Cbl-70Z (Figure 6B	D). Cbl has been shown to degrade SFKs by ubiquitination.38	64 Therefore	 up-regulation of SFK activity in the presence of Cbl mutants could be explained by inhibition of their degradation (Figure 7A). In addition	 we found Cbl-R420Q and Cbl-70Z in complex with Kit-KD and SFKs (Figure 7B). Inhibition of SFKs led also to Akt inhibition (Figure 7E)	 suggesting that SFKs act upstream of PI3K/Akt pathway as previously reported.65	66 SFKs activate Akt either directly or by phosphorylating Cbl at tyrosine 731	 which is the binding site for the PI3K.9 SFK inhibition with PP-1	 PP-2	 or dasatinib completely inhibited proliferation and clonogenic growth (Figure 7F-H). Previously	 Fyn has been shown to bind and phosphorylate Cbl and to activate PI3K.67 Our data show that the Src family member Fyn binds to Cbl (Figure 7D). Kit inhibition with imatinib reduced the proliferation of cells overexpressing Kit-WT and Cbl-70Z stronger compared with cells expressing Kit-KD and Cbl-70Z (Figure 7H)	 but much lesser than dasatinib	 which in addition inhibits SFKs. This indicates that Kit kinase activity is required but not essential. These findings are extending and complementing our previous findings.19 SFKs therefore are crucial components of the complex formed by KD RTKs and Cbl mutants	 and their inhibition prevents transformation. Therefore	 RTKs may not be the ideal target kinases for tyrosine kinase inhibitors in a Cbl mutationâ€“driven disease. Instead	 SFKs may be interesting target kinases	 for which inhibitors are readily 4206 BANDI et al BLOOD	 5 NOVEMBER 2009   VOLUME 114	 NUMBER 19 From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 28	 2017. For personal use only. available. Dasatinib	 for example	 is a multitargeted kinase inhibitor of Brc-Abl	 SFKs	 Kit	 PDGFR	 and ephrin A receptor kinases.68-70 It also emerged as a potent inhibitor of imanitibresistant protein tyrosine kinase activation loop mutants of Kit	 and it is able to induce apoptosis in mast cell and leukemic cell lines expressing these mutations.71 The data presented here demonstrate that SFKs play a critical role in the mechanism of transformation of Cbl mutants. AML blasts expressing Cbl mutants (or dysregulated Cbl function by other mechanisms) might be resistant to tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeted for Flt3 or Kit. Although direct Cbl mutations may be rare in AML	 similar mechanisms in the RTK degradation machinery may be operational in a large proportion of AMLs. Further studies are required to determine whether kinase inhibitors targeted at both RTKs and SFKs may overcome this primary resistance to RTK inhibitors.  
4	13||Noonan syndrome is an autosomal dominant congenital disorder that encompasses effects on multiple organ systems	 including distinctive facial features	 heart defects	 a short stature	 learning difficulties	 a predisposition to malignancies	 and other clinical manifestations [Roberts et al.	 2013]. It belongs to a group of genetic syndromes	 the RASopathies or RAS pathway disorders	 which are caused by mutations in genes that encode proteins involved in RAS-MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathways [Zenker	 2011]. Germline mutations in PTPN11	 SOS1	 KRAS	 NRAS	 RAF1	 BRAF	 MAP2K1	 or RIT1 underlie Noonan syndrome [Aoki et al.	 2013; Roberts et al.	 2013]. Disease-causing mutations usually enhance signal flow through RAS-MAPK cascades [Schubbert et al.	 2007]. Moreover	 mutations in two genes	 SHOC2 and CBL (MIM# 165360)	 have been reported in patients with Noonan-like phenotypes and additional untypical features [Cordeddu et al.	 2009; Martinelli et al.	 2010; Niemeyer et al.	 2010; Perez et al.	 2010]. Besides	 somatic CBL mutations have been found in various myeloproliferative disorders [Caligiuri et al.	 2007; Sargin et al.	 2007; Loh et al.	 2009; Makishima et al.	 2009; Muramatsu et al.	 2010].  CBL (also known as c-Cbl) is a multifunctional adaptor protein with ubiquitin ligase (E3) activity	 thereby catalyzing ubiquitylation of substrate proteins [Schmidt and Dikic	 2005]. CBL function has been implicated in ligand-mediated internalization and postendocytic sorting of various cell-surface proteins such as the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) [Piper and Lehner	 2011]	 which is a major cellular access to the RAS-MAPK signaling highway. In the present model	 CBL is recruited to the activated EGFR directly by interaction with the receptor at a phosphotyrosine residue [Levkowitz et al.	 1999] and indirectly through the adaptor protein Grb2 [Waterman et al.	 2002; Jiang et al.	 2003]. E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes are then recruited to the RING domain of CBL to promote receptor ubiquitylation; subsequently	 ubiquitin-binding proteins (e.g.	 Epsin) and other endocytic proteins (e.g.	 AP-2) attach and mediate EGFR internalization [Sorkin and Goh	 2009]. After trafficking into endosomes	 EGFR can either be recycled back to the plasma membrane or transported into lysosomes for degradation	 and ubiquitylation of EGFR is a prerequisite for degradative receptor sorting	 a process also called receptor downregulation [Sorkin and Goh	 2009]. Cells use EGFR internalization and sorting into a functional degradative pathway in order to attenuate the magnitude and duration of signaling events [Sorkin and Goh	 2009]. Thus	 CBL negatively regulates EGFR-RAS-MAPK signal traffic downstream of EGFR by controlling receptor internalization and degradation.  For the presented report	 our main objectives were to determine the functional consequences of pathogenic CBL mutations affecting evolutionary conserved amino acids on EGFR ubiquitylation and trafficking and to relate these data to RAS-MAPK pathway dysregulation in Noonan syndrome and other RASopathies. Materials and Methods  Plasmids  We used a human wild-type CBL construct (RefSeq: NM_005188.3) as a template and CBL-specific PCR primers to generate a wild-type CBL cDNA amplicon by PCR. Mutant CBL constructs were established by PCR-mediated mutagenesis. Purified PCR amplicons (CBLWT	 CBLC381A	 CBLK382E	 CBLD390Y	 and CBLR420Q) were cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO (Life Technologies	 Darmstadt	 Germany) according to the protocol provided. Constructs were sequenced for integrity and used for the transfer into GATEWAYâ„¢-compatible destination vector pcDNA3-DEST	 following the manufacturer's instructions. Wild-type CBL construct was a gift from Mirko Schmidt (Goethe University School of Medicine	 Frankfurt am Main	 Germany). Wild-type pcDNA3-EGFR construct (RefSeq: NM_005228.3) was a gift of Dr. Sarah J. Parsons (University of Virginia	 Charlottesville	 VA). pRK5-HA-ubiquitin (RefSeq: NM_021009.5) was purchased from Addgene (plasmid 17608). Cell culture and transfection  COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS; PAA Laboratories	 CÃ¶lbe	 Germany) and penicillin-streptomycin (100 U/ml and 100 Î¼g/ml	 respectively; Life Technologies) and incubated at 37Â°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with pcDNA3-DEST-CBL constructs using Lipofectamineâ„¢2000 Reagent (Life Technologies) or TurboFectâ„¢ (Thermo Scientific	 Bonn	 Germany) according to manufacturer's protocols. Immunoblotting  After transfection with expression constructs	 cells were incubated under serum-starved (0.1% FBS) conditions overnight. Next morning	 cells were stimulated with 10 or 20 ng/ml EGF (Sigmaâ€“Aldrich	 Taufkirchen	 Germany) for different times or left untreated. Cells were washed with ice-cold 1Ã— PBS and harvested in modified RIPA (radioimmunoprecipitation assay) buffer (150 mM NaCl	 50 mM Trisâ€“HCl	 pH 8.0	 0.5% sodium desoxycholate [w/v]	 1% Nonidet P40 [v/v]	 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate [w/v]) containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche	 Mannheim	 Germany) and	 if applicable	 phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche) or N-ethylmaleimide (Sigmaâ€“Aldrich). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 21	000 g for 10 min at 4Â°C and protein solutions were supplemented with sample buffer. Proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF (polyvinylidene difluoride) membranes. Following blocking (20 mM Trisâ€“HCl	 pH 7.4; 150 mM NaCl; 0.1% Tween-20; 4% nonfat dry milk) and washing (20 mM Trisâ€“HCl	 pH 7.4; 150 mM NaCl; 0.1% Tween-20) membranes were incubated in primary antibody solution (20 mM Trisâ€“HCl	 pH 7.4; 150 mM NaCl; 0.1% Tween-20; 5% BSA or 0.5% nonfat dry milk) containing the appropriate antibodies. Next	 membranes were washed and incubated with peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody. After final washing	 immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Millipore	 Schwalbach	 Germany). Antibodies and reagents  Following primary antibodies and dilutions were used: rabbit anti-Cbl (C-15	 WB 1:1	000; IF 1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology	 Heidelberg	 Germany); rabbit anti-EGFR (clone 1005	 WB 1:300; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); rat anti-HA-HRP (WB 1:12	000; Roche); rabbit anti-p44/42 MAP kinase (ERK 1/2	 approved protein symbols MAPK3 and MAPK1) antibody (WB 1:1	000; Cell Signaling Technology	 Danvers	 MA)	 rabbit anti-phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase (pERK 1/2) (Thr202/Tyr204) antibody (WB 1:1	000; Cell Signaling Technology)	 mouse anti-Î±-tubulin antibody (clone DM 1A; WB 1:7	500; Sigmaâ€“Aldrich). As secondary antibodies	 horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (1:5	000â€“1:30	000 dilution; GE Healthcare	 Munich	 Germany) were used. Further reagents used are as follows: Cycloheximide (10 Î¼g/ml; Sigmaâ€“Aldrich)	 N-ethylmaleimide (10 mM; Sigmaâ€“Aldrich)	 EGF complexed with Alexa Fluor 488 (100 ng/ml; Life Technologies)	 and unlabelled human EGF (10 ng/ml or 20 ng/ml; Sigmaâ€“Aldrich). High EGF concentrations were chosen because only higher concentrations of EGF (>10 ng/ml) induce nonclathrin-mediated endocytosis (NCE) in addition to clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) [Sigismund et al.	 2008; Sigismund et al.	 2013]. Notably	 EGFR ubiquitylation seems to be indispensable for NCE [Sigismund et al.	 2013]	 but not for CME [Madshus and Stang	 2009; Sorkin and Goh	 2009; Haglund and Dikic	 2012; Sigismund et al.	 2012]. Biotinylation-based EGFR cell surface assay  COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with CBL expression constructs and incubated under serum-starved (0.1% FBS) culture conditions overnight. Next day	 cells were stimulated with starvation medium supplemented with 10 ng/ml EGF for 30 min or left untreated. Subsequently	 cells were transferred on ice and washed three times with ice-cold HBSS (Life Technologies). Next	 cell surface proteins were biotinylated using 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-SS biotin (Thermo Scientific Pierce	 Bonn	 Germany) in HBSS for 15 min at 4Â°C. Unbound biotin was removed by washing twice with ice-cold HBSS containing 5 mM Trisâ€“HCl (pH 7.4) followed by rinsing with PBS. Subsequent to biotinylation	 cells were harvested in ice-cold RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Aliquots of the total cell lysates were kept for immunoblotting and the remaining supernatants were subjected to precipitation with streptavidin agarose (Sigmaâ€“Aldrich) overnight at 4Â°C. Biotin-labeled surface EGFR fractions coupled to agarose beads were collected by centrifugation for 1 min at 8	000 g at 4Â°C	 and agarose pellets were washed twice with ice-cold RIPA buffer. Precipitates and total cell lysates were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels	 transferred to PVDF membranes	 and subjected to immunodetection. Biotinylation-based EGFR internalization assay  COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with CBL expression constructs and incubated under serum-starved (0.1% FBS) culture conditions overnight. Cells were transferred to ice	 rinsed three times with ice-cold HBSS	 and cell surface proteins were biotinylated using 0.5 mg/ml biotin (Thermo Scientific Pierce) in HBSS for 15 min at 4Â°C. Unbound biotin was quenched by washing three times with 5 mM Trisâ€“HCl (pH 7.4) in HBSS. Internalization of biotinylated EGF receptors was induced by stimulation with 10 ng/ml EGF in prewarmed starvation medium (0.1% FBS) for 30 min at 37Â°C. To stop endocytosis and remove remaining cell surface-bound biotin	 cells were transferred on ice and immediately covered and washed with ice-cold glutathione-containing buffer (50 mM glutathione	 1 mM EDTA	 75 mM NaCl	 10% FBS [v/v]	 75 mM NaOH). After washing with ice-cold PBS	 cells were lysed in RIPA buffer; as controls and to demonstrate the efficiency of biotin-stripping	 unstimulated cultures were lysed in RIPA buffer. Biotinylated proteins were precipitated using streptavidin-conjugated agarose beads; intracellular EGFR fractions were collected in the precipitates. After washing precipitates with RIPA buffer	 both total cell lysates and precipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting. EGFR degradation assay  COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with CBL expression constructs and incubated under serum-starved (0.1% FBS) culture conditions overnight. Next day	 cells were incubated with 10 Î¼g/ml cycloheximide in starvation medium for 30 min to block protein synthesis. Then	 parallel cultures were stimulated by incubation in starvation medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml EGF for 60	120	 or 240 min at 37Â°C. As controls	 parallel cultures were harvested without EGF stimulation. Cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and lysed with ice-cold RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl	 1% Nonidet P40 [v/v]	 0.5% sodium deoxycholate [w/v]	 0.1% SDS [w/v]	 50 mM Tris	 pH 8). Finally	 lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Immunocytochemistry  COS-7 cells were cultivated on coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine and transiently transfected with CBL expression constructs. To visualize EGFR localization	 cells were serum-starved overnight and stimulated with 100 ng/ml fluorescently labeled EGF in starvation medium (0.1% FBS) for 30 min. Subsequently	 cells were rinsed with PBS	 fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigmaâ€“Aldrich) in PBS	 and washed three times with PBS. After treatment with permeabilization/blocking solution (2% BSA	 3% goat serum	 0.5% Nonidet P40 in PBS)	 cells were incubated in antibody solution (3% goat serum and 0.1% Nonidet P40 in PBS) containing rabbit anti-Cbl (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) primary antibody. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor Dyes; Life Technologies) in antibody solution. After extensive washing with PBS	 cells were embedded in mounting solution (25% Mowiol 4â€“88 in PBS mixed with 5% propyl gallate in PBS/glycerol in a ratio of 4:1) on microscopic slides. Cells were examined with a Leica DMIRE2 confocal microscope equipped with an HCX PL APO 63Ã—/1.32 oil immersion objective lens. Quantification of EGF488 signals was performed using Image J software. EGFR ubiquitylation assay  COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with CBL expression constructs together with HA-tagged ubiquitin and EGFR expression constructs. Transfected cells were incubated under serum-starved (0.1% FBS) culture conditions overnight. Next day	 cells were stimulated with starvation medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml EGF for 30 min at 37Â°C. Cells were washed with ice-cold 1Ã— PBS and harvested in ice-cold RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail and 10 mM N-ethylmaleimide (Sigmaâ€“Aldrich) to inhibit deubiquitylating enzymes. Next	 the cell debris was removed by centrifugation and aliquots of the total cell lysates were kept for immunoblotting. The remaining supernatants were incubated with 1 Î¼g of anti-EGFR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 hr at 4Â°C	 followed by incubation with protein A-agarose beads (Roche) overnight at 4Â°C. EGFR coupled to agarose beads were collected by centrifugation for 30 sec at 12	000g at 4Â°C	 and agarose pellets were washed three times with ice-cold Triton lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100 [v/v]	 150 mM NaCl	 5 mM EDTA	 50 mM HEPES	 pH 7.5) supplemented with 0.05% (w/v) SDS. Precipitates and total cell lysates were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels	 transferred to PVDF membranes	 and subjected to immunodetection. Scanning densitometry and statistical analysis  Signals on microscopic images and on autoradiographs were quantified by densitometric analysis using the ImageJ software (NIH; http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/index.html). Relative EGF488 and EGFR levels were assessed as described in the figure legends. One-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were used to compare means of all conditions (CBL protein variants) for statistical significance. Means were considered significant different at P value <0.05. Subsequently	 post hoc two-tailed unpaired Student's t-tests were used to determine statistical significance of the difference of the mean values between two conditions each (i.e.	 CBLWT versus CBLC381A	 CBLK382E	 CBLD390Y	 or CBLR420Q). Values are presented as the mean Â± SD and were considered significant different at P value <0.05. Results  CBL missense mutations in patients with Noonan syndrome-like phenotypes affect amino acids within the linker-RING finger domain [Martinelli et al.	 2010; Niemeyer et al.	 2010; Perez et al.	 2010] (Fig. 1A). Since an intact RING finger domain is essential for both ligand-mediated internalization and degradation of the EGFR [Sorkin and Goh	 2009]	 we analyzed functional consequences of three disease-associated CBL amino acid changes within this domain (Fig. 1A).  Figure 1.  Figure 1. Open in figure viewerDownload Powerpoint slide Modular architecture of CBL and consequences of CBL mutants on EGFR surface levels. A: CBL protein domains and motifs. The total number of amino acids (aa) is given. Tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain (aa 47â€“345)	 linker sequence (linker	 aa 346â€“380)	 RING finger domain (RING	 aa 381â€“423)	 proline-rich region (ProR	 aa 481â€“688)	 and ubiquitin-associated domain (UBA	 aa 857â€“894) are schematically shown. Amino acid substitutions analyzed in this study are indicated. B: p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q amino acid changes compromise CBL function during removal of surface EGFR. COS-7 cells transiently expressing the indicated CBL protein variants or transfected with empty vector (mock) were cultured under serum-starved conditions overnight. Next day	 cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml EGF for 30 min (30 min tEGF) at 37Â°C or left untreated (0 min tEGF). Subsequently	 surface proteins were biotinylated at 4Â°C and precipitated from cell extracts by using streptavidin-conjugated agarose beads. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-EGFR antibodies. Representative autoradiographs show EGFR levels in total cell lysates (tcl) and precipitates (pcpt). Expression of CBL protein variants in total cell lysates was monitored by immunoblotting using anti-CBL antibodies and anti-tubulin antibodies were used to control for equal loading. C: Densities of autoradiographic signals obtained from experiments as described in (B) were quantified by scanning densitometry. Amounts of surface EGFR (i.e.	 precipitated EGFR) was normalized to total EGFR and considered as 100% for unstimulated parallel cultures (0 min tEGF). Thus	 surface EGFR upon EGF stimulation (30 min tEGF) is expressed as percentage of surface EGFR in unstimulated cells. Data represent the mean of n independent experiments Â± SD. One-way ANOVA between groups: P > 0.05 (not significant). Post hoc testing was not performed. CBL amino acid changes p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q alter cellular EGFR distribution  If CBL mutations interfere with EGFR internalization	 the amount of surface and intracellular EGFR should be altered in cells expressing mutant CBL proteins. Therefore	 we determined the level of surface and intracellular EGFR in cells stimulated with EGF for 30 min by using surface biotinylation-based assays. Expression of CBLWT resulted in a clear reduction of surface EGFR upon EGF stimulation (Fig. 1B	 CBLWT	 precipitates	 30 min) relative to unstimulated cells (Fig. 1B	 CBLWT	 precipitates	 0 min). In contrast	 transfection of cells with CBL mutants (Fig. 1B; CBLK382E	 CBLD390Y	 or CBLR420Q) or with empty vector (Fig. 1B	 mock) did not induce marked alterations of surface EGFR levels (Fig. 1B	 compare precipitates for 0 and 30 min each). In line with this	 CBLC381A	 a RING finger mutant (Fig. 1A) that has already been shown to perturb EGFR internalization [Waterman et al.	 1999; Thien et al.	 2001] and that we used as an internal control	 also did not stimulate removal of surface EGFR (Fig. 1B). Densitometric measurements and statistical analysis revealed that only 55.6% of initial EGFR (unstimulated cells) remained at the surface of cells ectopically expressing CBLWT; however	 cells expressing mutant CBL variants or mock-transfected cells displayed between 73.8% and 88.1% of initial EGFR at the cell surface after 30-min EGF treatment (Fig. 1C). Thus	 CBLWT may promote EGF-induced EGFR internalization	 whereas mutations associated with Noonan syndrome-like phenotypes (p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q) as well as the established RING finger mutation p.C381A may compromise this CBL effect. Even though differences of mean values did not reach statistical significance in these experiments by using one-way ANOVA (data not shown)	 a tendency for impaired removal of surface EGFR caused by CBL mutations is obvious. Indeed	 we could substantiate our results by the determination of the amounts of intracellular EGFR after ligand stimulation. CBLWT overexpression resulted in a marked enrichment of the intracellular EGFR fraction upon 30-min EGF treatment (Fig. 2A	 blots on the left-hand side	 precipitates	 30 min) indicating efficient ligand-induced EGFR internalization. Cells expressing any of the tested CBL mutants (CBLK382E	 CBLD390Y	 CBLR420Q	 or CBLC381A) showed slightly decreased levels of intracellular EGFR relative to CBLWT-expressing cells (Fig. 2A	 autoradiographs on the left-hand side	 precipitates	 30 min). Mock-transfected cells also showed reduced amounts of internalized EGFR compared to CBLWT-expressing cells (Fig. 2A	 autoradiographs on the right-hand side	 precipitates; [note: all bands on these autoradiographs represent results after 30-min EGF stimulation]). On the other hand	 CBL mutants seemed to have even less intracellular EGFR upon 30-min EGF stimulation than mock-transfected cells (Fig. 2A	 autoradiographs on the right-hand side	 precipitates). By densitometric measurements and statistical analysis of several independent experiments	 we could prove that expression of mutant CBL variants resulted in significantly decreased ligand-induced internalization of EGFR compared to CBLWT-expressing cells by about 25%â€“33% (Fig. 2B). These data suggest loss-of-function consequences of disease-associated CBL amino acid changes. Interestingly	 mock transfection led to intermediate amounts of intracellular EGFR	 minus 15% compared to CBLWT but about plus 15% compared to CBL mutants (Fig. 2B)	 which may indicate that CBL mutations exert additional dominant-negative effects on EGFR internalization. To confirm our observations by microscopic analysis	 we stimulated COS-7 cells with fluorescently labeled EGF (EGF488) for 30 min (Fig. 3). For these analyses	 we used anti-CBL antibodies	 which recognize ectopically expressed as well as endogenous CBL protein; thus	 untransfected cells and cells expressing very low levels of CBL protein variants cannot be differentiated and both are considered as control cells. Strong expression of CBLWT resulted in increased intracellular EGF488 compared to control cells on the same specimen (Fig. 3A). In contrast	 cells strongly expressing CBLK382E	 CBLD390Y	 CBLR420Q	 or CBLC381A showed reduced amounts of intracellular EGF488 when compared to control cells on the respective same specimen (Fig. 3A). We validated these observations by quantification	 normalization	 and statistical evaluation of immuncytochemical specimens: although expression of CBLWT strongly increased intracellular EGF488 levels	 expression of any CBL mutant decreased the amount of intracellular EGF488 (Fig. 3B). Taken together	 our data demonstrate that CBL amino acid changes p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q alter the cellular distribution of EGFR and we suggest that impaired EGFR internalization underlies this defect.

Cells were transferred on ice	 remaining cell surface bound biotin was removed	 and cells were harvested. Internalized biotinylated proteins were precipitated with streptavidin-conjugated agarose and samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. To represent each CBL protein variant at least once	 autoradiographs from two different experiments are shown. To demonstrate the efficiency of biotin stripping	 the autoradiographs on the left-hand side also show the levels of precipitated EGFR in unstimulated (0 min tEGF) cells. EGFR levels in total cell lysates (tcl) and precipitates (pcpt) were determined using anti-EGFR antibodies	 expression of CBL protein variants in total cell lysates was monitored by using anti-CBL antibodies	 and anti-tubulin antibodies were used to control for equal loading. B: Autoradiographic signals obtained from experiments as described in (A) were quantified by scanning densitometry. Amount of intracellular EGFR (i.e.	 precipitated EGFR) was normalized to total EGFR and considered as 100% for CBLWT-expressing cells at 30 min tEGF. Thus	 internalized EGFR upon 30-min EGF stimulation is expressed as percentage of internalized EGFR in CBLWT-expressing cells. Data represent the mean of n independent experiments Â± SD.

CBL amino acid changes p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q impair CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitylation and abrogate the stimulating effect of CBL on EGFR degradation  The CBL RING finger domain is central to the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity [Zheng et al.	 2000]	 and CBL-mediated ubiquitylation strongly affects the postendocytic EGFR fate by lysosomal targeting and subsequent degradation of ubiquitylated receptors [Swaminathan and Tsygankov	 2006; Sorkin and Goh	 2009]. First	 we monitored the capacity of wild-type and mutant CBL proteins to ubiquitylate EGFR upon 30-min EGF stimulation by using precipitation-based ubiquitylation assays. Overexpression of CBLWT resulted in a strong ubiquitylation signal in EGFR precipitates (Fig. 4A	 top panel; CBLWT) relative to mock-transfected cells (Fig. 4A	 top panel; mock). In contrast	 transfection of cells with CBL mutants associated with Noonan-like phenotypes did not result in augmented EGFR ubiquitylation (Fig. 4A	 top panel; CBLK382E	 CBLD390Y	 or CBLR420Q). Similarly	 cells expressing ubiquitylation-deficient CBLC381A [Waterman et al.	 1999; Thien et al.	 2001] showed slightly lower levels of ubiquitylated EGFR than CBLWT cells (Fig. 4A	 top panel; CBLC381A and CBLWT). Perfectly in line with the function of ubiquitin-labeling as a trigger for degradation [Swaminathan and Tsygankov	 2006; Sorkin and Goh	 2009]	 the total amount of EGFR in cells expressing CBLWT was markedly decreased (Fig. 4A	 second and third panel). These representative data from one out of three independent experiments strongly indicate that disease-associated CBL amino acid changes p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q abrogate CBL ubiquitin ligase activity. To measure the impact of CBL mutations on EGFR degradation	 we determined the amounts of total EGFR upon 60	120	 and 240 min of EGF stimulation. Ectopic expression of CBLWT induced a rapid loss of cellular EGFR within 60 min of EGF stimulation followed by constant EGFR levels over the rest of the observation period (Fig. 4B); this indicates that EGFR is subject to effective degradation. In contrast	 in cells transfected with empty vector	 EGFR levels slowly decreased over the time	 starting with a slight reduction of EGFR at 60 min to a marked loss at 240 min of EGF treatment (Fig. 4B). Cells expressing CBLK382E	 CBLD390Y	 or CBLR420Q showed very similar EGFR degradation kinetics to that of mock-transfected cells (Fig. 4B)	 which indicates loss of the stimulating effect of CBL on EGFR degradation. Interestingly	 it seemed that expression of CBLC381A most effectively blocks EGFR degradation (Fig. 4B). We verified these observations by densitometric measurements and statistical analysis of several independent experiments (Fig. 4C): CBLWT induced a reduction to 30.8% of initial EGFR after 60-min EGF stimulation	 whereas mock transfection or expression of CBLK382E	 CBLD390Y	 or CBLR420Q resulted in a decrease to 69.0%	68.80%	74.90%	 and 64.2% of initial EGFR	 respectively (Fig. 4C). These data demonstrate that the promoting effect of CBLWT on EGFR degradation is impaired by disease-associated mutations p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q. Notably	 the control mutant CBLC381A strongly delayed EGFR degradation with only 20% of initial EGFR amounts having been degraded at 240 min upon EGF treatment (Fig. 4C). This may indicate additional negative consequences of the p.C381A change on EGFR trafficking.  Figure 4.  Figure 4.

COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with CBL expression constructs (as indicated) or with empty vector (mock) together with HA-tagged ubiquitin and EGFR expression constructs. Subsequent to incubation under serum-starved culture conditions overnight	 cells were stimulated with 20 ng/ml EGF for 30 min (tEGF) and harvested in ice-cold RIPA buffer containing 10 mM N-ethylmaleimide to inhibit deubiquitylating enzymes. EGFR was immunoprecipitated with anti-EGFR antibodies and protein A-agarose and samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Levels of ubiquitylated EGFR in precipitates (ip) were monitored by using anti-HA antibodies. EGFR levels in total cell lysates (tcl) and precipitates (ip) were determined by using anti-EGFR antibodies and expression of CBL protein variants in total cell lysates was shown by using anti-CBL antibodies. Representative blots from one out of three independent experiments are shown. B and C: EGFR degradation. B: COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with CBL expression constructs or with empty vector (mock) as indicated and cultured under serum-starved conditions overnight. Next day	 cells were treated with 10 Î¼g/ml cycloheximide for 30 min to block protein synthesis and	 subsequently	 stimulated with 20 ng/ml EGF for 60	120	 or 240 min (tEGF) at 37Â°C or left untreated (0 min tEGF). Cell extracts (tcl) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-EGFR antibodies. Anti-tubulin antibodies were used to control for equal loading	 and the expression of CBL protein variants in total cell lysates was monitored by using anti-CBL antibodies; note that the gradually reduction of CBL protein expression after EGF treatment has been reported previously [Schmidt et al.	 2006]. C: Autoradiographic signals obtained from experiments as described in (B) were quantified by scanning densitometry. Amounts of EGFR in unstimulated cells (0 min tEGF) were considered as 100% and EGFR levels upon EGF stimulation (60	120	 and 240 min tEGF) are expressed as percentage of EGFR in unstimulated cells (0 min tEGF). Data represent the mean of n independent experiments Â± SD. One-way ANOVA between groups: P60 min < 0.05	 P120 min < 0.05	 P240 min < 0.05. Post hoc P values were calculated by unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01. Disease-associated mutations disrupt the ability of CBL to attenuate RAS-MAPK signaling  RASopathies are caused by hyperstimulation of RAS-MAPK signaling cascades [Aoki et al.	 2008]. Therefore	 by measuring ERK phosphorylation levels in COS-7 cells	 we determined activation of ERK proteins	 which are well-defined key players in RAS-MAPK signaling [Dhillon et al.	 2007]. We documented a time course for ERK phosphorylation upon EGF stimulation and we found no statistically significant differences after 10- and 30-min EGF stimulation between cells expressing CBLWT and either cells expressing disease-associated CBL protein variant or mock-transfected cells (Fig. 5A and B). At 60 min upon EGF stimulation	 cells expressing CBLWT showed reduced ERK1/2 phosphorylation compared with mock-transfected cells; however	 cells expressing CBLC381A	 CBLK382E	 CBLD390Y	 or CBLR420Q did not (Fig. 5A and B). In fact	 phospho-ERK1/2 levels were significantly increased in CBLC381A	 CBLK382E	 CBLD390Y	 or CBLR420Q cells relative to CBLWT-expressing cells at 60 min upon EGF stimulation (Fig. 5A and B). Quantification revealed between 1.43-fold and 2.24-fold higher ERK phosphorylation levels in cells expressing CBL mutant proteins or in mock-transfected cells than in CBLWT-expressing cells (Fig. 5B). We conclude that amino acid changes p.C381A	 p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q abrogate the potential of CBL to attenuate RAS-MAPK signaling.  Figure 5.  Figure 5.

Subsequently	 total cell lysates (tcl) were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) and anti-ERK1/2 antibodies. Expression of CBL protein variants was monitored by immunoblotting using anti-CBL antibodies	 and anti-tubulin antibodies were used to control for equal loading. B: Autoradiographic signals obtained from experiments as described in (A) were quantified by scanning densitometry. Levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 was normalized relative to amounts of total ERK1/2 and ERK phosphorylation in cells expressing CBLWT was considered as 1. Thus	 the graphs show phosphorylation levels in mock-transfected cells and mutant CBL-expressing cells relative to that in cells expressing CBLWT (arbitrary units (a.u.)).

Discussion  Here	 we provide evidence that dysfunction of EGFR trafficking contributes to a clinically variable condition out of RASopathy-spectrum disorders. Defective endocytic sorting of receptors has been already proposed as a pathomechanistic basis for Noonan syndrome related phenotypes [Martinelli et al.	 2010]. By detailed analyses	 we could now demonstrate that RASopathy-associated amino acid changes p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q in the CBL RING domain (i) derange the cellular distribution of EGFR	 (ii) interfere with CBL-mediated ubiquitylation of EGFR	 (iii) abrogate the stimulating effect of CBL on EGFR degradation	 and (iv) disrupt CBL-mediated downregulation of RAS-MAPK signaling.  EGFR is internalized through different mechanisms: non-clathrin-mediated endocytosis (NCE) and clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) [Sorkin and Goh	 2009]. EGFR ubiquitylation seems to be indispensable for NCE [Sigismund et al.	 2013]	 whereas the need of EGFR ubiquitylation for CME is discussed controversially [Madshus and Stang	 2009; Sorkin and Goh	 2009; Haglund and Dikic	 2012; Sigismund et al.	 2012]. In line with our data on CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitylation (Fig. 4A)	 recently it has been reported that the disease-associated CBL amino acid changes p.D390Y and p.R420Q result in impaired EGFR ubiquitylation in response to EGF stimulation [Martinelli et al.	 2010]; this indicates loss-of-function consequences regarding the CBL ubiquitin ligase capacity. Several reports have shown that an intact CBL linker-RING domain is essential for EGF/EGFR internalization [e.g.	 Waterman et al.	 1999; Thien et al.	 2001; Jiang and Sorkin	 2003]. Taken together	 we suggest that RASopathy-associated amino acid changes	 which disrupt the ability of CBL to ubiquitylate EGFR	 compromise EGFR internalization and	 therefore	 result in higher amounts of surface and lower amounts of intracellular EGFR (Figs. 1B and C and 2). Notably	 intracellular EGFR levels in mock-transfected cells	 which lie between those in wild-type and mutant CBL-expressing cells (Fig. 2)	 may indicate a dominant-negative effect of CBL changes p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q on EGFR internalization. Accordingly	 dominant-negative effects of myeloid neoplasm-associated CBL missense mutations (p.Q367P	 p.Y371 S	 and p.R420Q) on CBL ubiquitin ligase function and receptor endocytosis have been demonstrated [Sargin et al.	 2007; Sanada et al.	 2009]. Dominant-negative consequences could be explained by competitive binding of mutant and wild-type CBL alleles to phosphotyrosine-containing motifs of activated EGFR in the combination with the inability of mutant CBL to recruit E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes to the RING domain. This	 however	 remains to be proved.  EGFR ubiquitylation is largely devoted to commit EGFR to lysosomal degradation [Haglund and Dikic	 2012]. In line with this	 we detected rapid and efficient EGFR degradation upon ectopic expression of CBLWT	 but not in cells expressing mutant CBL protein variants (Fig. 4A and B). Since all tested RASopathy-associated CBL variants and mock-transfection caused very similar degradation kinetics	 we suggest loss-of-function consequences of p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q on EGFR degradation. Interestingly	 the p.C381A mutation strongly delayed and blocked EGFR degradation. Cysteine 381 is a key residue for the binding of zinc	 an important cofactor for stabilizing the RING domain; mutations may disrupt zinc-chelating loops that accommodate significant contact with E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes [Zheng et al.	 2000]. However	 at the moment there is no valid mechanistic explanation for differing functional consequences of the p.C381A change and the RASopathy-associated mutations	 because all of these affect amino acids that seem to be essential for the formation of the binding interface for E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes [Zheng et al.	 2000; Martinelli et al.	 2010].  Noonan syndrome and related disorders are associated with dysregulated RAF-MAPK signal transduction [Schubbert et al.	 2007]. In cells expressing mutant CBL	 we detected ERK phosphorylation levels that were stronger than in CBLWT cells but similar to control cells (Fig. 5) indicating a loss of the ability to attenuate RAS-MAPK signaling. Thus	 this loss-of-function effect of RASopathy-associated CBL mutants is transformed into a gain of RAS-MAPK signaling. We conclude that inefficient degradation and affected internalization of EGFR (and possibly other CBL-regulated cell surface receptors) finally result in pronounced ligand-induced signaling events such as increased RAS-MAPK signal flux. This interrelation is well known from the pathogenesis of malignancies: enhanced RAS-MAPK signaling is common to human cancer and activating somatic mutations have been described in various genes encoding proteins of these signaling pathways [Dhillon et al.	 2007]; in addition	 somatic mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in the downregulation of receptors upstream of the RAS-MAPK signaling highway (e.g.	 CBL	 HIP1	 and TSG101) have been linked to malignancies [Bache et al.	 2004]. Consistently	 malfunction of the trafficking machinery inhibits either the early phase of receptor internalization or the transport of internalized receptor complexes toward degradation	 both of which promote the development of cancer [Dikic and Schmidt	 2007]. Taken together	 we suggest that RASopathy-associated lesions affect CBL binding with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes	 which results in loss of CBL ubiquitylation capacity and defective trafficking of EGFR (and other CBL-regulated cell surface receptors); this then again prolongs the availability of activated surface receptors in the cell	 which finally is transformed into increased RAS-MAPK signaling.  Germline CBL mutations are associated with a strikingly variable phenotype [Martinelli et al.	 2010; Niemeyer et al.	 2010; Perez et al.	 2010]	 as this is generally the case for Noonan syndrome and related disorders [Allanson et al.	 2010; Roberts et al.	 2013]. Modifier genes may explain these inter- and intragenic differences in disease expression indicating that these monogenic diseases rather are Mendelian disorders [Nadeau	 2001; Slavotinek and Biesecker	 2003; Genin et al.	 2008]. Since all the genes implicated in Noonan syndrome encode proteins integral to the EGFR-RAS-MAPK pathway	 phenocritical genetic modifiers may include genes involved in this signaling network. Remarkably	 Noonan syndrome and related disorders are caused by mutations in genes encoding more proximal components of RAS-MAPK signaling	 for example	 PTPN11 and SOS1	 whereas other RASopathies	 the cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome and Costello syndrome	 are associated with lesions in downstream components of RAS-MAPK cascades [Aoki et al.	 2008]. Therefore	 for Noonan syndrome it was proposed that in addition to RAS-MAPK signaling other downstream pathways could be affected	 which may account for the marked phenotypic variability [Roberts et al.	 2007]. Accordingly	 the position of CBL as the most upstream regulator of RAS-MAPK signaling associated with RASopathies by now may functionally explain the extreme clinical variability of patients with CBL germline mutations	 which has been reported recently [Martinelli et al.	 2010]. In this respect	 by describing a further regulatory level in the RASopathy network	 namely	 the trafficking of growth factor receptors upstream of RAS-MAPK signaling	 we underline the growing functional variability of RASopathy-associated gene lesions. Thereby	 we add important novel aspects to the knowledge of the pathophysiological basis of RASopathies	 which markedly expands the number of possible functional candidate genes for RAS-MAPK pathway associated diseases: mutations in genes coding for proteins that regulate trafficking of EGFR and other receptors upstream of RAS-MAPK signaling may account for genetically yet unclarified cases of RASopathies. This knowledge may facilitate the evaluation of genomic variants in exome data from mutation-negative patients with RASopathies and may open new pharmacogenomic approaches to rescue hyperstimulation of RAS-MAPK cascades. Oncogenic mutations in the monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) gene have been found in many tumors	 but their significance remains largely unknown. Several human c-Cbl (CBL) structures have recently been solved depicting the protein at different stages of its activation cycle and thus provide mechanistic insight underlying how stability-activity tradeoffs in cancer-related proteins may influence disease onset and progression. In this study	 we computationally modeled the effects of missense cancer mutations on structures representing four stages of the CBL activation cycle to identify driver mutations that affect CBL stability	 binding	 and activity. We found that recurrent	 homozygous	 and leukemia-specific mutations had greater destabilizing effects on CBL states than did random non-cancer mutations. We further tested the ability of these computational models assessing the changes in CBL stability and its binding to ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2	 by performing blind CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays in cells. Experimental CBL ubiquitin ligase activity was in agreement with the predicted changes in CBL stability and	 to a lesser extent	 with CBL-E2 binding affinity. Two-thirds of all experimentally tested mutations affected the ubiquitin ligase activity by either destabilizing CBL or disrupting CBL-E2 binding	 whereas about one-third of tested mutations were found to be neutral. Collectively	 our findings demonstrate that computational methods incorporating multiple protein conformations and stability and binding affinity evaluations can successfully predict the functional consequences of cancer mutations on protein activity	 and provide a proof of concept for mutations in CBL.  Keywords: CBL	 driver mutations	 protein interactions Go to: Introduction Whole exome sequencing of cancer patients has produced unprecedented amounts of data to analyze and interpret; these studies report a very large fraction of missense mutations which can potentially be implicated in tumorigenensis (1). Although some missense mutations can provide selective growth advantage to tumor cells (driver mutations)	 the large majority of them are considered to be neutral (passenger mutations). The mechanisms by which the driver variants may affect protein stability	 interactions	 and function remain largely unknown. Various computational methods have been developed to estimate the impacts of disease mutations on proteins but most of them exclusively use sequence features and do not explicitly utilize the protein three-dimensional structures	 their physico-chemical properties and dynamics (2	 3). Many cancers are characterized by (de)activation of certain proteins which may be a result of missense mutations (4). The interconversion between active and inactive states is highly regulated in proteins and it is not well understood how these regulatory mechanisms are disrupted in cancer. The development of in silico approaches to estimate the effects of disease mutations on protein activity	 stability and binding will help to define which are likely to be driver or passenger mutations. Moreover	 understanding the mechanisms of their actions would allow for prioritization of potential driver candidates for better targeted therapies to design drugs which might in turn compensate for the reduced/enhanced protein stability or activity.  The monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) RING finger ubiquitin ligase (E3) represents an exceptionally difficult yet important system to study the mechanisms of cancer mutations (5	 6). Strikingly	 proteins from this family play both positive and negative regulatory roles in tyrosine kinase signaling which is aberrantly activated in many cancers (5). Oncogenic mutations in the c-Cbl gene (referred to as CBL thereafter) were found in human myeloid neoplasms and other tumors (5) but the significance of these mutations and their impacts on CBL function were studied only for very few mutants (7). The mechanistic aspects of CBL cancer mutations can now be adequately addressed as several CBL structures have become available which represent the snapshots of different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1). All CBL proteins share a highly conserved N-terminus which includes a tyrosine kinaseâ€“binding domain (TKBD)	 a linker helix region (LHR) and a RING finger domain	 while the C-terminus comprises a proline-rich region (8). The RING domain of CBL has E3 activity and ubiquitinates activated receptor tyrosine kinases which subsequently targets them for degradation (8). At the same time	 since CBL proteins can bind to activated receptor tyrosine kinases via the TKBD domain	 they can serve as adaptors by recruiting downstream signal transduction components such as SHP2 and P13K (9	 10).  Figure 1 Figure 1 CBL activation cycle. The structures representing the activation cycle of CBL are shown. In the inactive closed state (nCBL) the protein exists in the cytosol. Upon activation of the RTK	 CBL can bind to the phosphorylated RTK (orange peptide) via TKBD ... Another aspect of CBL function which should be accounted for in modeling the effects of cancer mutations is that it can bind to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) in complex with ubiquitin (Ub) and a substrate protein	 thereby facilitating the transfer of Ub from E2 to a lysine residue of the substrate (11). The crystal structure of the inactive complex of CBL with E2 (UbcH7) was solved more than ten years ago (12) while the active phosphorylated CBL-E2 (UbcH5B) complex was resolved fairly recently (13). According to the latter study	 substrate binding and Tyr371 phosphorylation activates CBL by producing a large conformational change in order to place the RING domain and E2 in close proximity to the substrate. It was further confirmed that phosphorylation-induced conformational change is required for positioning of ubiquitin for effective catalysis (14).  Here we present a new approach	 which aims to assess the effects of cancer mutations on stability	 binding and activity of cancer related proteins. We apply computational models to four different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1) and perform blind in vivo experiments of CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination. We show a rather remarkable agreement of experimental EGFR ubiquitination by CBL mutants with the computed changes in CBL thermodynamic stability and to a lesser extent with CBL-E2 binding affinity. The computational models not only quantitatively predict the magnitude of the effects of mutations but also shed light on the mechanisms of their action. Namely	 we find that cancer mutations have greater destabilizing effects on four CBL states than random non-cancer mutations for recurrent	 homozygous and leukemia mutations. Most damaging cancer mutations happen in the sites involved in Zn-coordination and in the formation of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds within CBL or between CBL and E2. Overall cancer driver mutations affect different or multiple stages of the CBL activation cycle either completely abolishing its E3 activity or partially attenuating it. The computational models based on stability and binding affinity calculations can discriminate experimentally validated driver from passenger mutations (with the exception of two mutations) and outperform several state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods aiming to predict phenotypic impacts of mutations.  Go to: Materials and Methods Computational modeling and analysis  Mapping of CBL mutations The COSMIC database (15) stores data on somatic cancer mutations and integrates the experimental data from full-genome sequencing studies. We extracted 103 missense mutations for the CBL gene from the COSMIC database (15) that could be mapped to four available CBL structures in its activation cycle (Fig. 1). Cancer mutations were classified into different classes according to the frequency of observed samples (single and recurrent mutations)	 zygosity (homo- and heterozygous mutations)	 types of cancer (leukemia and sarcoma) and the involvement of mutations in Zn-coordination (Table S1). In addition	 all possible single nucleotide substitutions resulting in amino-acid changes in the CBL gene were performed to obtain a â€œRandomâ€ missense mutation reference set. After excluding mutations observed in COSMIC and mutations occurring on residues without known coordinates in crystal structures	 we obtained 2	102 random missense mutations (Table S1). We also searched the dbSNP database (16) but found very few benign variations in the CBL gene. Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.  Model preparation We investigated the effects of mutations on four states of the CBL activation cycle: (1) closed CBL state (nCBL)	 (2) partially opened CBL state bound to substrate (CBL-S)	 (3) unphosphorylated autoinhibitory CBL bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and (4) phosphorylated CBL bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1). It was previously noted that both UbcH5B and UbcH7 can bind specifically to CBL but only UbcH5B can facilitate ubiquitination (17). The crystal structures of nCBL (PDB id: 2Y1M) (13)	 CBL-S (PDB id: 2Y1N) (13) and pCBL-E2-S (PDB id: 4A4C) (13) were obtained directly from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (18). Only one crystal structure of the unphosphorylated inactive state of CBL bound to E2 (UbcH7) and Zap-70 peptide (PDB id: 1FBV) (12) was available in PDB. Although sequence identity between UbcH7 and UbcH5B proteins is 38%	 the structural similarity is very high with the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.04 Ã…. The unphosphorylated autoinhibitory structure of CBL-UbcH5B-S was therefore modeled based on CBL-UbcH7-S (PDB id: 1FBV) using Chimera (19). (Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.)  Minimization procedure We applied our recently developed optimization protocol for minimizing wild-type and mutant structures (20). Heavy side chain atoms without known coordinates and hydrogen atoms were added to the crystal structures using the VMD (version 1.9.1) program (21) with models immersed into rectangular boxes of water molecules extending up to 10 Ã… from the protein in each direction. Wild-type protein complexes were minimized for 40	000 steps using explicit TIP3P water model. The final minimized models of wild-type protein complexes were used to produce all mutant structures and then an additional 300-step minimization for all mutant structures was performed. The energy minimization was carried out with the NAMD program (version 2.9) (22) using the CHARMM27 force field (23). For unfolding free energy calculations we applied the optimization procedure implemented in the RepairPDB module of the FoldX program (24) which optimizes the side chain configurations to provide a repaired structure. (See Supplementary Materials and Methods for more information.)  Binding and unfolding free energy calculations Binding free energy and effects of mutations on binding affinity were calculated according to the approach introduced by us earlier (20). Energy calculations were based on the modified MM-PBSA method that combined the molecular mechanics terms with the Poissonâ€“Boltzmann continuum representation of the solvent (25) and statistical scoring energy functions with parameters optimized on experimental sets of several thousand mutations (equation 3). Binding free energy calculations were performed on minimized wild-type and mutant structures of inactive CBL-E2-S and active pCBL-E2-S states. The binding energy is defined as a difference between the free energies of the complex and unbound proteins.  Î”Gbind=GCBL-E2-S-GCBL-S-GE2 (1) The change of binding energy due to a mutation can be calculated as:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î”Gbindmut-Î”GbindWT (2) The effect of mutations on binding affinity was calculated in this work using the following energy function:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î±Î”Î”Evdw+Î²Î”Î”Gsolv+Î³Î”SAmut+ÎµÎ”Î”GBM+Î»Î”Î”GFD+Î´ (3) Here Î”Î”Evdw is the change of the van der Waals interaction energy and Î”Î”Gsolv is the change of the polar solvation energy of solute in water. Î”SAmut represents a term proportional to the interface area of the mutant complex. Î”Î”GBM and Î”Î”GFD are the binding energy changes from BeAtMuSiC and FoldX	 respectively. BeAtMuSiC (26) estimates the effect of mutations on binding based on statistical potentials.  The FoldX software program (24) was used to estimate the unfolding free energy and to model the unfolding state. FoldX calculates the effects of mutations on protein stability using an empirical force field. The BuildModel module was used to introduce a mutation	 optimize the configurations of the neighboring side chains and calculate the difference in stability (unfolding free energy) between mutant ( Î”Gfoldmut) and repaired native structure ( Î”GfoldWT).  Î”Î”Gfold=Î”Gfoldmut-Î”GfoldWT (4) For comparison we used three alternative methods to predict the impacts of mutations on unfolding free energy: the Eris server (27)	 the Rosetta program (28) and the PoPMuSiC server (29). We also applied four additional webtools to assess the impacts of amino acid substitutions on CBL function: PROVEAN (30)	 PolyPhen-2 (31)	 MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). (See Supplementary Methods for more information.)  Go to: Experimental procedures Expression constructs  Human CBL cDNA was originally obtained from Wallace Langdon and subsequently cloned into the pCEFL expression plasmid (34). Point mutation constructs	 described above	 were created from wild-type CBL using the QuikChange II Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions (Stratagene	 La Jolla	 CA). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.  Cell culture and transfections  The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T	 the human nonsmall cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the human cervical cancer cell line HeLa used in this study were originally obtained from ATCC and maintained in culture using DMEM (Gibco	 Grand Island	 NY) supplemented with 10% FBS	 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin sulfate. Cell lines were authenticated by Short Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis by using either Promega Powerplex 16 (Promega	 Madison	 WI) or the AmpFISTR Identifier Kit (Life Technologies	 Carlsbad	 CA) and compared to the ATCC or DSMZ databases. HeLa cells were received in the lab in 2013 last authenticated on 7-30-15	 A549 were received in the lab in 2015 and last authenticated on 8-12-15	 and HEK293T were received in the lab in 1995 and last authenticated on 10-8-15.HEK293T cells were transfected using calcium phosphate according to the instructions accompanying the reagent (Profection; Promega Corp.	 Madison	 WI)	 incubated 18 h prior to media change and grown for a total of 48 h prior to harvesting. A549 and Hela cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen	 Carlsbad	 CA). Transfections were allowed to incubate 6 h prior to media change	 and cells were grown an additional 48 h before being harvested. Cells were starved for 4 hours and treated with EGF (100 ng/ul). Each cell-based experiment was repeated at least two times.  Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation  To harvest proteins	 cells were washed twice in ice-cold Dulbeccoâ€™s PBS-containing 200 Î¼M sodium orthovanadate (Fisher Chemicals	 Fairlawn	 NJ) then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5	 150 mM NaCl	 5 mM EDTA	 1% Triton X-100	 10% glycerol	 100 mM iodoacetamide [Sigma-Aldrich Corp.	 St. Louis	 MO]	 2 mM sodium orthovanadate	 and protease inhibitors [Complete tabsÂ®	 Roche Diagnostics Corp.	 Indianapolis	 IN]). All whole cell lysates were cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 16	000 Ã— g for 15 m at 4 Â°C. Supernatant protein concentrations were determined using the BioRad protein assay (BioRad	 Hercules	 CA). For immunoblotting	 20Î¼g of whole cell lysates were boiled in a 1:1 dilution of 2X loading buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8	 10% glycerol	 2% SDS	 1 mg/ml bromophenol blue	 0.3573 M Î²-mercaptoethanol) for 5 m. For immunoprecipitations	 150 Î¼g of each of the whole cell lysates were incubated with rabbit anti-EGFR (Ab-3; Millipore) and with Protein A/G+ agarose beads (sc-2003; Santa Cruz Biotechnology	 Santa Cruz	 CA). All immunoprecipitations were incubated overnight at 4Â°C with tumbling. Immune complexes were washed five times in 1 mL cold lysis buffer	 then resuspended in 2X loading buffer	 boiled for 5 m	 then resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran BA85; Whatman	 Sanford	 MA). For immunoblot detection of proteins	 the following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-EGFR (2232L; Cell Signaling)	 rat monoclonal high affinity anti-HA-peroxidase	 (clone 3F10; Roche)	 rabbit anti-Cbl (sc-C-15; Santa Cruz) and mouse anti-Hsc70 (sc-7298; Santa Cruz). Horseradish peroxidase linked donkey anti-rabbit IgG (NA934V; GE Healthcare	 Piscataway	 NJ)	 or donkey anti-mouse IgG (NA931: GE Healthcare	 Piscataway	 NJ) immunoglobulin was used with SuperSignal (Pierce Biotechnology Inc.	 Rockford	 IL) to visualize protein detection.  Densitometric Analysis  Immunoblots were developed on HyBlot CL Autoradiography Film (Denville Scientific Inc.	 South Plainfield	 NJ) with an X-OMAT automated processor (Eastman Kodak	 Rochester	 NY). Protein expression levels were then recorded using an Epson Perfection V750 PRO scanner (Epson Inc.	 Long Beach	 CA) and densitometric analysis was performed using Adobe Photoshop software version 7.0 (Adobe Systems Inc.	 U.S.A). EGFR ubiquitination signal intensity was determined by optical density in a set area normalized against the EGFR band intensity in parallel immunoblots and expressed as a densitometric ratio of ubiquitination/EGFR levels. The mean densitometric ratio of EGFR ubiquitination	 in the presence of each CBL mutation	 was then assessed relative to wild-type CBL where the ratio was set at 1.0.  Go to: Results Cancer mutations impact CBL stability  We estimated the thermodynamic stability (unfolding free energy) changes	 Î”Î”Gfold	 upon mutation for closed (nCBL) and partially opened (CBL-S) CBL states (Fig. 1). These states did not involve binding to E2. The examination of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for random non-cancer mutations (Fig. 2A) showed that it was very similar to experimental distributions produced by random mutagenesis on a set of different proteins (35	 36). Namely	 the distribution for random non-cancer mutations was asymmetrically centered at positive energy values and there were about 10% of random mutations with highly damaging effects on CBL structures by more than 5 kcal molâˆ’1 (Fig. 2A). Despite the presence of highly damaging random mutations	 recurrent cancer mutations overall produced significantly larger destabilizing effects compared to random (p-value â‰ª 0.01) for both nCBL and CBL-S states (Fig. 2A and S1	 Table S2). This was not the case for single cancer mutations observed in only one patient (Table S2). Overall	 the form of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for recurrent cancer mutations was different from the Î”Î”Gfold distribution of random mutations (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p-value â‰ª 0.01) whereas the distribution for single cancer mutations was indistinguishable from a random mutation distribution. However	 it does not mean that all single cancer mutants can be considered passenger	 as we show later	 this is not the case for some of them.  Figure 2 Figure 2 (A) The distribution of unfolding (Î”Î”Gfold) and binding (Î”Î”Gbind) free energy changes for Single	 Recurrent and Random class mutations on nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states (see SI for other states). Positive and negative values ... The top 25% cancer mutations with the largest damaging effects are presented in Table S3. Many of them occurred in Zn-coordinating sites while many others did not involve Zn-coordination sites. Some of these latter mutations (G415V	 G413R and G415S) introduced large Van der Waals clashes with neighboring residues which could not be accommodated by side chain rearrangements	 whereas other mutations (S376F	 Y371D and L405P) affected disulfide or hydrogen bonds. For example	 L405P located in the middle of an Î±-helix affected the CBL structure by introducing an energetically unfavorable kink in the helix due to its inability to donate an amide hydrogen bond.  Effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding  The outcome of mutations can be assessed by the extent of structural changes they induce. We calculated the local root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between the minimized wild-type and mutant structures around the mutated site. We found that the protein backbone in the vicinity of a mutation of the CBL-E2 complex underwent larger local conformational changes upon recurrent cancer mutations	 especially for mutations occurring in Zn-coordinating site clusters	 compared to random mutations (p-value â‰ª 0.01	 Fig. S2 and S3). In the previous section we analyzed the original closed (nCBL) state and partially opened (CBL-S) state induced by substrate binding. In this section we study the effects of cancer mutations on two other CBL states: an autoinhibitory CBL state bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and phosphorylated active CBL state bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1) (13). Effects of mutations on binding can be in general linked with their structural locations	 therefore we examined the locations of mutations and found that about one third of all cancer mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface (Fig. S4). This preference was found to be statistically significant (p-value â‰ª 0.01) (Fig. S4).  It was previously experimentally shown that binding between CBL and E2 was rather weak with a micromolar dissociation constant (13). Despite the fact that the interface between CBL and E2 in the inactive state is several residues larger than in the active state	 consistent with experiments	 we found somewhat stronger binding between CBL and E2 for the active state of CBL (Table S4). Similarly to the impacts of cancer mutations on stability	 recurrent (but not single) mutations destabilized CBL-E2 binding significantly (Fig. 2B	 S1 and Table S2). Importantly	 cancer mutations reduced the CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state (p-value = 0.002) (Fig. 2B) and the effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding of the active state were noticeably larger compared to random mutations even if we excluded mutations in Zn-coordinating sites (Table S2). This latter observation does not hold true for the autoinhibitory CBL-E2-S conformation.  Next	 all cancer mutations were ranked with respect to their effects on CBL-E2 binding. About half of all highly damaging mutations (top 25% of most damaging mutations	 Table S3) impacted both stability and CBL-E2 binding for all four CBL states. Among them	 several mutations occurred in Zn-coordinating clusters and M400 and L405 sites. Another class of mutations (involving W408 and R420 sites) mostly influenced CBL-E2 binding. For example	 the W408S mutation caused the largest perturbation in CBL-E2 binding of the active state by decreasing binding affinity up to 3.5 kcal molâˆ’1 but having a moderate effect on stability of the nCBL and CBL-S states. It was previously suggested that amino acids in positions W408 and I383 constituted specificity of CBL-E2 binding and corresponded to binding hot spots (10	 12). Mutations in the I383 site are not recorded in the COSMIC database although they have a profound destabilizing effect on CBL-E2 binding for both states (see data for random mutations on the ftp site ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/panch/CBL). Another site affecting binding of CBL (R420) is a highly conserved site in the CBL family	 it strongly interacts with the Q92	 W93 and S94 residues of E2. It was previously experimentally verified that mutations in this site disrupted the CBL activity and could be associated with cytokine-independent growth (37). There are 24 cancer patient samples where mutations of this site (R420Q	 R420L and R420P) are found and they all produce strong destabilizing effects on the active pCBL-E2-S state.  According to the zygosity annotation	 there are 49 heterozygous (â€œHeteroâ€) and 27 homozygous (â€œHomoâ€) mutations (Table S1) and for the rest of cancer mutations their zygocity status is undetermined. Overall	 we found that destabilizing mutations were enriched among homozygous compared to heterozygous mutations for all stages of CBL activation cycle (p-value = 0.021 â€“ 0.035) and were more prevalent in leukemia compared to sarcoma patients (p-value = 0.000 â€“ 0.003) (Fig. 2B	 Table S2). This observation could not be attributed to the prevalence of homozygous mutations in Zn-coordinating clusters since these clusters had almost equal numbers of heterozygous and homozygous mutations. It was reported earlier that many homozygous mutations could be connected to uniparental disomy when germline heterozygosity would lead to neoplasia upon reduction to homozygosity (6	38	 39). If some patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms had germline heterozygous mutations in CBL	 then lost the wild-type CBL allele and duplicated mutant allele	 it would be possible that the damaging mutant allele would be duplicated in a cancer cell with a higher probability. Indeed	 human leukemia samples show the loss of the normal CBL allele.  CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination: comparing experiments with computational models  Next we randomly picked fifteen cancer mutations based on their predicted damaging status	 trying to equally sample highly damaging and benign mutations irrespective to their frequencies in cancer samples	 and experimentally tested the E3 activity of wild-type and mutant CBL proteins (see Methods	 Table 1). As can be seen in Fig. 3A	 in the presence of wild-type CBL	 activation of the EGFR induced more than a 10-fold increase in the ubiquitination of the EGFR compared to empty vector (endogenous CBL levels) in HEK293T cells (compare lane 4 to lane 2 in top panel of Fig. 3A). The E3 activity of wild-type CBL was mirrored by a decrease in the levels of immunoprecipitated EGFR consistent with the targeting of ubiquitinated EGFR for degradation (compare lanes 2 and 4 in second panel of Fig. 3A).  Figure 3 Figure 3 (A) EGFR ubiquitination. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant CBL proteins along with the EGFR and hemagglutinin (HA)-epitope tagged ubiquitin. The vector control and wild-type	 CBL transfectant cells were incubated ... Table 1 Table 1 Experimental relative densitometry values for HEK293T cells	 predicted changes in stability (Î”Î”Gfold kcal molâˆ’1)	 binding affinity (Î”Î”Gbind kcal molâˆ’1) and comparison with other methods for 15 experimentally ... We classified all mutations into three groups (damaging	 attenuating and benign) according to their experimental relative densitometry data and compared experimental data with the estimates produced by the computational models. The first group of damaging mutants included C396R	 H398Q	 Y371H	 K382E and C381A which completely abolished CBL activity (relative densitometry was less than 10%) (Fig. 3B) and the levels of total EGFR were not decreased by these mutants (Fig. 3A). Only two of these mutants belonged to the Recurrent class of mutations. Table 1 shows predicted and experimentally verified effects of mutations on all four CBL states. All five mutants were predicted to be damaging by stability and binding affinity calculations but the mechanisms of their action were different. C396R	 H398Q and C381A mutations disrupted Zn-coordinating clusters and had very damaging consequences according to the stability model for both nCBL and CBL-S states and damaging effects on CBL-E2 binding even though none of these mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface. On the other hand	 the K382E mutation did not affect Zn-coordination but destabilized the nCBL state. This	 in turn	 could be explained by the charge substitution that led to the disruption of the K382-E373 salt bridge within the closed state of nCBL (Figure 4 and Figure S5A). Moreover	 K382E mutation had a significant impact on CBL-E2 binding due to the disruption of a salt bridge between pY371 and K382 affecting the stability of CBL in the active state (Figure 4 and Figure S5D). No significant changes were observed for CBL-S and CBL-E2-S states (Figure S5B	C). K382E mutation was previously observed in Noonan syndrome and was speculated to affect CBL stability or binding (40). Finally	 the Y371H mutation not only abolished phosphorylation at the Y371 site but also had a profound destabilizing effect on all four states as evident from Table 1.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Structures of wild type (green) and K382E mutant (tan) are shown for nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states. Salt bridges are shown as dashed lines and in both cases mutation affects the stability by disrupting the salt bridge. The second group of mutants (M374V	 V430M	 P428L	 Q249E and double mutant S80N/H94Y) maintained the CBL activity equivalent to or greater than wild-type CBL (relative densitometry of 80% or higher) (Fig. 3B). Consistent with this	 the levels of the activated EGFR were also decreased in these samples (Fig. 3A). To confirm that the retained E3 activity of these mutants was not cell type specific	 we transfected these mutants into the non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the cervical cancer cell line Hela (Fig. S6). The S80N/H94Y and Q249E mutations were previously identified in human non-small cell lung cancers making the A549 cell line a relevant cell type to investigate the function of these CBL mutants while other cancer mutations were found in other cancer types. As in the HEK293T cells	 transfection of wild-type CBL into A549 and HeLa cells resulted in a significant increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of EGFR compared to the cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. S6). The increase in transfected CBL protein compared to endogenous CBL protein was less in HeLa than in either the A549 or HEK293T cells. Consistent with this	 the fold increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of the EGFR by wild-type CBL was smaller in Hela cells (about three fold) compared to either A549 or HEK293T cells (more than 10 fold in each). As in HEK293T cells	 the Y371H mutant did not stimulate ubiquitination compared to the vector transfected control for A549 or HeLa cells (Fig. S6A and C). The CBL mutants that were fully active in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3A and B) maintained CBL E3 activity in A549 and HeLa cells (Fig. S6). Two of these CBL mutants resulted in more ubiquitination of EGFR compared to wild type CBL. For example	 the Q249E mutant showed an increased ubiquitination of EGFR in 293T and HeLa cells while the M374V mutant resulted in higher ubiquitination levels in A549 and HeLa cells (Figure 3 and S6). Only V430M mutant was on the borderline with the densitometry ratio of 0.8. All mutations from the second group were predicted to be benign according to our computational models	 whereas V430M	 consistent with experimental data	 had a borderline destabilizing impact on CBL-E2 binding (Table 1).  Finally	 the third group constituted mutations (L399V	 G375P	 P395A and V391I) which attenuated the CBL E3 activity according to the relative densitometry data (Fig. 3B). Only one of these mutants was observed in two cancer samples while other three belonged to the Single mutation class. Concordant with this	 there were intermediate levels of EGFR (Fig. 3A). G375P and P395A mutations were predicted to have partially damaging effects while V391I and L399V were classified as benign in our predictions. Interestingly	 mutations from this third group affected only some of the CBL states. In contrast	 the highly damaging mutations from the first group had damaging impacts on almost all CBL states.  Next we tested if the reduction in CBL ubiquitination activity was directly correlated with the effects of mutations on stability (Fig. 5A). The relationship between experimental densitometry data and Î”Î”Gfold was better described by an exponential dependence with correlation coefficient (R) of 0.77 and 0.78 for CBL-S and nCBL states respectively (Table S5). Indeed	 the change in absorption between wild-type and mutant proteins which refers to a fraction of active mutants can be described by the Boltzmann equation relating the probability of a state with the energy of this state. A mutation may lead to damaging effects and a loss of function if it impacts at least one of the CBL functional states. Taking this into consideration we calculated the correlation between densitometry and stability changes taking a maximum of Î”Î”Gfold values for the nCBL and CBL-S states. As shown in Fig. 5A and Table S5	 changes in stability can indeed explain the effects of mutations on CBL ubiquitination activity with high correlation of R = 0.83. For comparison	 several alternative methods were applied to predict the effect of mutations on unfolding free energy	 they all reported correlation coefficients ranging from 0.21 to 0.52	 with only one method PopMusic reporting a statistically significant correlation of 0.52 (Table S5). The relationship between densitometry and binding affinity changes was on the borderline of significance with a linear correlation coefficient of 0.48 and 0.62 (if two highly damaging mutations were excluded) (Fig. 5B and Table S5).  Figure 5 Figure 5 (A) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (exponential model) and maximal predicted changes in stability. (B) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (linear model) and predicted changes in binding affinity of pCBL-E2-S state. ... There are various methods which predict the phenotypic effects of mutations	 (30â€“33	 41) and some of them use structural features (31	 41). We applied four state-of-the-art independent methods to predict the impacts of mutations on CBL function: PROVEAN (30)	 PolyPhen-2 (31)	 MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). Some of these methods outperformed our model in classifying cancer from random mutations since they were trained to distinguish disease from neutral variants (Table S6). However	 all four methods had a very limited accuracy in classifying CBL cancer mutations into those that disrupted function and those that did not. As evident from Table 1 and Table S5	 all methods except for PROVEAN over-predicted damaging effects of experimentally tested mutations while PROVEAN was the only method which produced a significant correlation between the densitometry data and PROVEANâ€™s score (R=0.58	 Table S5).  Go to: Discussion Stability-activity balance in cancer related proteins  Evolutionary selection to maintain structural	 foldable and functional proteins eliminates many mutations in protein sequences. On the other hand	 thermodynamic stability can be compromised in evolution to ensure certain arrangements of catalytic and binding sites	 which might not be energetically optimal (36	 42). In tumorigenesis	 protein stability or binding may be reduced (or in some cases increased) due to cancer mutations. As a consequence it can lead to decreased fitness at the protein level	 but may confer a fitness advantage for the population of tumor cells (43	 44). However	 the extent of the stability-activity tradeoff in oncogenes and tumor suppressors remains largely unknown. Using the example of the CBL protein	 here we tried to elucidate the stability-activity balance and to understand whether the loss or gain of activity in cancer-related proteins can be accompanied by compromised stability or binding.  In contrast to many other computational studies	 which attempt to link stability with activity by mostly focusing on one protein conformation	 we performed an analysis on four different stages of the CBL activation cycle. Our predictions of changes in stability and binding were further elucidated by the experimental CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays. We found a strong relationship between the effects of mutations on CBL stability and experimentally obtained densitometry data (quantifying activity)	 while a relatively weaker correlation was observed between changes in densitometry and CBL-E2 binding affinity. It could be explained either by a less significant impact of experimentally tested mutations on CBL-E2 binding or by a limited coupling (compared to CBL stability) between CBL-E2 binding and E3 activity.  Drivers or passengers?  According to our study	 about two thirds of all experimentally tested mutations either completely abolished or attenuated E3 activity	 while one third of them were neutral. Trying to assess the limitations of our models	 we applied state-of- the-art methods commonly used to predict functional effects of mutations. However	 these methods failed to distinguish inactivating from neutral mutations as accurately as the computational models which were solely based on accounting for the effects on stability and binding for different CBL states. Indeed	 many methods are not specifically designed to discriminate driver from passenger mutations within the pool of cancer mutations	 but rather they perform a task of distinguishing cancer from neutral mutations.  Certainly	 the large majority of all mutations detected in cancer genomics studies are likely to be neutral although the collective burden of passenger mutations may also alter the course of tumorigenesis (45). When we analyzed the distribution of all single cancer missense mutations observed in the CBL gene	 their average effects on stability or binding were not found to be significantly different from the pool of random mutations. These mutations either mostly constitute true passenger mutations or their oncogenic mechanisms are not directly connected to protein destabilization. The story is quite the opposite for the recurrent mutations as they have on average significantly higher destabilizing effects than random mutations and the majority of them should be drivers. An interesting group of mutations includes those which are highly damaging but found only in one cancer sample (10% of all single cancer mutations). These mutations may represent either rare driver or latent driver mutations (46). Several of these mutations were experimentally tested and are listed in Table 1.  CBL-E2 binding in deciphering the mechanisms of cancer  Our analysis showed that cancer mutations reduce CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state. It is in contrast to the stability-activity tradeoff reported for EGFR and other cancer related proteins (47)	 where cancer mutations may disrupt autoinhibitory interactions and activate the kinase (48	 49). Importantly	 all mutations with experimentally tested high inactivating effects have impacts on both CBL stability and CBL-E2 binding (Table 1). In fact	 the correlation between Î”Î”Gfold and Î”Î”Gbind for CBL cancer mutations from COSMIC is positive (R = 0.20 â€“ 0.48 depending on the CBL state	 p-value < 0.05). It might seem counterintuitive as some residues maintain stability by sustaining the RING-TKBD autoinhibitory interactions within CBL. This interface overlaps with the CBL-E2 interface and competes against E2 binding (13). One might think that disruption of RING-TKBD interactions and destabilization of CBL might facilitate binding to E2 and therefore lead to CBL activation. A slight activation was actually observed for two mutants	 one of which (M374V) was directly located on the CBL-E2 interface. However	 as we showed through the positive high correlation between stability and activity changes	 this mechanism is rarely observed and the vast majority of mutations disrupt CBL-E3 activity by either destabilizing CBL and/or CBL-E2 binding or by directly affecting phosphorylation of the critical tyrosine Y371.  Overall	 our results support the idea that decrease of E3 activity	 of the ability to ubiquitinate receptor tyrosine kinases	 of CBL stability and/or CBL-E2 binding can give a selective advantage for tumor cells. However	 there are several factors that complicate deciphering the mechanisms of action of CBL cancer mutations. CBL mutations can be dominant-negative and mutated CBL might not only change the CBL E3 activity but also might affect the concentration and activity of the wild-type CBL. According to a ratiometric method to identify driver genes in cancer (1)	 CBL can be regarded as an oncogene since it has several mutation hot spots. On the other hand	 as shown in our study and in other studies	 cancer driver mutations can inactivate the E3 activity of CBL	 so it can also be regarded as a tumor suppressor. Although the latter fact complicates the development of CBL targeted therapies	 understanding the delicate balance among different CBL-affected pathways may facilitate the indirect drug targeting of damaged CBL proteins. The current genetics-based frameworks to analyze cancer genome-wide sequence data are necessary but not sufficient for understanding the processes of carcinogenesis and developing informed	 targeted therapies. Our approach	 which can be applied in general to different proteins of interest	 emphasizes the importance of the physics of binding and protein conformational ensembles in deducing the mechanisms of cancer.  																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																
5	14||Oncogenic mutations in the monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) gene have been found in many tumors	 but their significance remains largely unknown. Several human c-Cbl (CBL) structures have recently been solved depicting the protein at different stages of its activation cycle and thus provide mechanistic insight underlying how stability-activity tradeoffs in cancer-related proteins may influence disease onset and progression. In this study	 we computationally modeled the effects of missense cancer mutations on structures representing four stages of the CBL activation cycle to identify driver mutations that affect CBL stability	 binding	 and activity. We found that recurrent	 homozygous	 and leukemia-specific mutations had greater destabilizing effects on CBL states than did random non-cancer mutations. We further tested the ability of these computational models assessing the changes in CBL stability and its binding to ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2	 by performing blind CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays in cells. Experimental CBL ubiquitin ligase activity was in agreement with the predicted changes in CBL stability and	 to a lesser extent	 with CBL-E2 binding affinity. Two-thirds of all experimentally tested mutations affected the ubiquitin ligase activity by either destabilizing CBL or disrupting CBL-E2 binding	 whereas about one-third of tested mutations were found to be neutral. Collectively	 our findings demonstrate that computational methods incorporating multiple protein conformations and stability and binding affinity evaluations can successfully predict the functional consequences of cancer mutations on protein activity	 and provide a proof of concept for mutations in CBL.  Keywords: CBL	 driver mutations	 protein interactions Go to: Introduction Whole exome sequencing of cancer patients has produced unprecedented amounts of data to analyze and interpret; these studies report a very large fraction of missense mutations which can potentially be implicated in tumorigenensis (1). Although some missense mutations can provide selective growth advantage to tumor cells (driver mutations)	 the large majority of them are considered to be neutral (passenger mutations). The mechanisms by which the driver variants may affect protein stability	 interactions	 and function remain largely unknown. Various computational methods have been developed to estimate the impacts of disease mutations on proteins but most of them exclusively use sequence features and do not explicitly utilize the protein three-dimensional structures	 their physico-chemical properties and dynamics (2	 3). Many cancers are characterized by (de)activation of certain proteins which may be a result of missense mutations (4). The interconversion between active and inactive states is highly regulated in proteins and it is not well understood how these regulatory mechanisms are disrupted in cancer. The development of in silico approaches to estimate the effects of disease mutations on protein activity	 stability and binding will help to define which are likely to be driver or passenger mutations. Moreover	 understanding the mechanisms of their actions would allow for prioritization of potential driver candidates for better targeted therapies to design drugs which might in turn compensate for the reduced/enhanced protein stability or activity.  The monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) RING finger ubiquitin ligase (E3) represents an exceptionally difficult yet important system to study the mechanisms of cancer mutations (5	 6). Strikingly	 proteins from this family play both positive and negative regulatory roles in tyrosine kinase signaling which is aberrantly activated in many cancers (5). Oncogenic mutations in the c-Cbl gene (referred to as CBL thereafter) were found in human myeloid neoplasms and other tumors (5) but the significance of these mutations and their impacts on CBL function were studied only for very few mutants (7). The mechanistic aspects of CBL cancer mutations can now be adequately addressed as several CBL structures have become available which represent the snapshots of different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1). All CBL proteins share a highly conserved N-terminus which includes a tyrosine kinaseâ€“binding domain (TKBD)	 a linker helix region (LHR) and a RING finger domain	 while the C-terminus comprises a proline-rich region (8). The RING domain of CBL has E3 activity and ubiquitinates activated receptor tyrosine kinases which subsequently targets them for degradation (8). At the same time	 since CBL proteins can bind to activated receptor tyrosine kinases via the TKBD domain	 they can serve as adaptors by recruiting downstream signal transduction components such as SHP2 and P13K (9	 10).  Figure 1 Figure 1 CBL activation cycle. The structures representing the activation cycle of CBL are shown. In the inactive closed state (nCBL) the protein exists in the cytosol. Upon activation of the RTK	 CBL can bind to the phosphorylated RTK (orange peptide) via TKBD ... Another aspect of CBL function which should be accounted for in modeling the effects of cancer mutations is that it can bind to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) in complex with ubiquitin (Ub) and a substrate protein	 thereby facilitating the transfer of Ub from E2 to a lysine residue of the substrate (11). The crystal structure of the inactive complex of CBL with E2 (UbcH7) was solved more than ten years ago (12) while the active phosphorylated CBL-E2 (UbcH5B) complex was resolved fairly recently (13). According to the latter study	 substrate binding and Tyr371 phosphorylation activates CBL by producing a large conformational change in order to place the RING domain and E2 in close proximity to the substrate. It was further confirmed that phosphorylation-induced conformational change is required for positioning of ubiquitin for effective catalysis (14).  Here we present a new approach	 which aims to assess the effects of cancer mutations on stability	 binding and activity of cancer related proteins. We apply computational models to four different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1) and perform blind in vivo experiments of CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination. We show a rather remarkable agreement of experimental EGFR ubiquitination by CBL mutants with the computed changes in CBL thermodynamic stability and to a lesser extent with CBL-E2 binding affinity. The computational models not only quantitatively predict the magnitude of the effects of mutations but also shed light on the mechanisms of their action. Namely	 we find that cancer mutations have greater destabilizing effects on four CBL states than random non-cancer mutations for recurrent	 homozygous and leukemia mutations. Most damaging cancer mutations happen in the sites involved in Zn-coordination and in the formation of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds within CBL or between CBL and E2. Overall cancer driver mutations affect different or multiple stages of the CBL activation cycle either completely abolishing its E3 activity or partially attenuating it. The computational models based on stability and binding affinity calculations can discriminate experimentally validated driver from passenger mutations (with the exception of two mutations) and outperform several state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods aiming to predict phenotypic impacts of mutations.  Go to: Materials and Methods Computational modeling and analysis  Mapping of CBL mutations The COSMIC database (15) stores data on somatic cancer mutations and integrates the experimental data from full-genome sequencing studies. We extracted 103 missense mutations for the CBL gene from the COSMIC database (15) that could be mapped to four available CBL structures in its activation cycle (Fig. 1). Cancer mutations were classified into different classes according to the frequency of observed samples (single and recurrent mutations)	 zygosity (homo- and heterozygous mutations)	 types of cancer (leukemia and sarcoma) and the involvement of mutations in Zn-coordination (Table S1). In addition	 all possible single nucleotide substitutions resulting in amino-acid changes in the CBL gene were performed to obtain a â€œRandomâ€ missense mutation reference set. After excluding mutations observed in COSMIC and mutations occurring on residues without known coordinates in crystal structures	 we obtained 2	102 random missense mutations (Table S1). We also searched the dbSNP database (16) but found very few benign variations in the CBL gene. Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.  Model preparation We investigated the effects of mutations on four states of the CBL activation cycle: (1) closed CBL state (nCBL)	 (2) partially opened CBL state bound to substrate (CBL-S)	 (3) unphosphorylated autoinhibitory CBL bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and (4) phosphorylated CBL bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1). It was previously noted that both UbcH5B and UbcH7 can bind specifically to CBL but only UbcH5B can facilitate ubiquitination (17). The crystal structures of nCBL (PDB id: 2Y1M) (13)	 CBL-S (PDB id: 2Y1N) (13) and pCBL-E2-S (PDB id: 4A4C) (13) were obtained directly from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (18). Only one crystal structure of the unphosphorylated inactive state of CBL bound to E2 (UbcH7) and Zap-70 peptide (PDB id: 1FBV) (12) was available in PDB. Although sequence identity between UbcH7 and UbcH5B proteins is 38%	 the structural similarity is very high with the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.04 Ã…. The unphosphorylated autoinhibitory structure of CBL-UbcH5B-S was therefore modeled based on CBL-UbcH7-S (PDB id: 1FBV) using Chimera (19). (Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.)  Minimization procedure We applied our recently developed optimization protocol for minimizing wild-type and mutant structures (20). Heavy side chain atoms without known coordinates and hydrogen atoms were added to the crystal structures using the VMD (version 1.9.1) program (21) with models immersed into rectangular boxes of water molecules extending up to 10 Ã… from the protein in each direction. Wild-type protein complexes were minimized for 40	000 steps using explicit TIP3P water model. The final minimized models of wild-type protein complexes were used to produce all mutant structures and then an additional 300-step minimization for all mutant structures was performed. The energy minimization was carried out with the NAMD program (version 2.9) (22) using the CHARMM27 force field (23). For unfolding free energy calculations we applied the optimization procedure implemented in the RepairPDB module of the FoldX program (24) which optimizes the side chain configurations to provide a repaired structure. (See Supplementary Materials and Methods for more information.)  Binding and unfolding free energy calculations Binding free energy and effects of mutations on binding affinity were calculated according to the approach introduced by us earlier (20). Energy calculations were based on the modified MM-PBSA method that combined the molecular mechanics terms with the Poissonâ€“Boltzmann continuum representation of the solvent (25) and statistical scoring energy functions with parameters optimized on experimental sets of several thousand mutations (equation 3). Binding free energy calculations were performed on minimized wild-type and mutant structures of inactive CBL-E2-S and active pCBL-E2-S states. The binding energy is defined as a difference between the free energies of the complex and unbound proteins.  Î”Gbind=GCBL-E2-S-GCBL-S-GE2 (1) The change of binding energy due to a mutation can be calculated as:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î”Gbindmut-Î”GbindWT (2) The effect of mutations on binding affinity was calculated in this work using the following energy function:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î±Î”Î”Evdw+Î²Î”Î”Gsolv+Î³Î”SAmut+ÎµÎ”Î”GBM+Î»Î”Î”GFD+Î´ (3) Here Î”Î”Evdw is the change of the van der Waals interaction energy and Î”Î”Gsolv is the change of the polar solvation energy of solute in water. Î”SAmut represents a term proportional to the interface area of the mutant complex. Î”Î”GBM and Î”Î”GFD are the binding energy changes from BeAtMuSiC and FoldX	 respectively. BeAtMuSiC (26) estimates the effect of mutations on binding based on statistical potentials.  The FoldX software program (24) was used to estimate the unfolding free energy and to model the unfolding state. FoldX calculates the effects of mutations on protein stability using an empirical force field. The BuildModel module was used to introduce a mutation	 optimize the configurations of the neighboring side chains and calculate the difference in stability (unfolding free energy) between mutant ( Î”Gfoldmut) and repaired native structure ( Î”GfoldWT).  Î”Î”Gfold=Î”Gfoldmut-Î”GfoldWT (4) For comparison we used three alternative methods to predict the impacts of mutations on unfolding free energy: the Eris server (27)	 the Rosetta program (28) and the PoPMuSiC server (29). We also applied four additional webtools to assess the impacts of amino acid substitutions on CBL function: PROVEAN (30)	 PolyPhen-2 (31)	 MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). (See Supplementary Methods for more information.)  Go to: Experimental procedures Expression constructs  Human CBL cDNA was originally obtained from Wallace Langdon and subsequently cloned into the pCEFL expression plasmid (34). Point mutation constructs	 described above	 were created from wild-type CBL using the QuikChange II Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions (Stratagene	 La Jolla	 CA). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.  Cell culture and transfections  The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T	 the human nonsmall cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the human cervical cancer cell line HeLa used in this study were originally obtained from ATCC and maintained in culture using DMEM (Gibco	 Grand Island	 NY) supplemented with 10% FBS	 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin sulfate. Cell lines were authenticated by Short Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis by using either Promega Powerplex 16 (Promega	 Madison	 WI) or the AmpFISTR Identifier Kit (Life Technologies	 Carlsbad	 CA) and compared to the ATCC or DSMZ databases. HeLa cells were received in the lab in 2013 last authenticated on 7-30-15	 A549 were received in the lab in 2015 and last authenticated on 8-12-15	 and HEK293T were received in the lab in 1995 and last authenticated on 10-8-15.HEK293T cells were transfected using calcium phosphate according to the instructions accompanying the reagent (Profection; Promega Corp.	 Madison	 WI)	 incubated 18 h prior to media change and grown for a total of 48 h prior to harvesting. A549 and Hela cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen	 Carlsbad	 CA). Transfections were allowed to incubate 6 h prior to media change	 and cells were grown an additional 48 h before being harvested. Cells were starved for 4 hours and treated with EGF (100 ng/ul). Each cell-based experiment was repeated at least two times.  Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation  To harvest proteins	 cells were washed twice in ice-cold Dulbeccoâ€™s PBS-containing 200 Î¼M sodium orthovanadate (Fisher Chemicals	 Fairlawn	 NJ) then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5	 150 mM NaCl	 5 mM EDTA	 1% Triton X-100	 10% glycerol	 100 mM iodoacetamide [Sigma-Aldrich Corp.	 St. Louis	 MO]	 2 mM sodium orthovanadate	 and protease inhibitors [Complete tabsÂ®	 Roche Diagnostics Corp.	 Indianapolis	 IN]). All whole cell lysates were cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 16	000 Ã— g for 15 m at 4 Â°C. Supernatant protein concentrations were determined using the BioRad protein assay (BioRad	 Hercules	 CA). For immunoblotting	 20Î¼g of whole cell lysates were boiled in a 1:1 dilution of 2X loading buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8	 10% glycerol	 2% SDS	 1 mg/ml bromophenol blue	 0.3573 M Î²-mercaptoethanol) for 5 m. For immunoprecipitations	 150 Î¼g of each of the whole cell lysates were incubated with rabbit anti-EGFR (Ab-3; Millipore) and with Protein A/G+ agarose beads (sc-2003; Santa Cruz Biotechnology	 Santa Cruz	 CA). All immunoprecipitations were incubated overnight at 4Â°C with tumbling. Immune complexes were washed five times in 1 mL cold lysis buffer	 then resuspended in 2X loading buffer	 boiled for 5 m	 then resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran BA85; Whatman	 Sanford	 MA). For immunoblot detection of proteins	 the following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-EGFR (2232L; Cell Signaling)	 rat monoclonal high affinity anti-HA-peroxidase	 (clone 3F10; Roche)	 rabbit anti-Cbl (sc-C-15; Santa Cruz) and mouse anti-Hsc70 (sc-7298; Santa Cruz). Horseradish peroxidase linked donkey anti-rabbit IgG (NA934V; GE Healthcare	 Piscataway	 NJ)	 or donkey anti-mouse IgG (NA931: GE Healthcare	 Piscataway	 NJ) immunoglobulin was used with SuperSignal (Pierce Biotechnology Inc.	 Rockford	 IL) to visualize protein detection.  Densitometric Analysis  Immunoblots were developed on HyBlot CL Autoradiography Film (Denville Scientific Inc.	 South Plainfield	 NJ) with an X-OMAT automated processor (Eastman Kodak	 Rochester	 NY). Protein expression levels were then recorded using an Epson Perfection V750 PRO scanner (Epson Inc.	 Long Beach	 CA) and densitometric analysis was performed using Adobe Photoshop software version 7.0 (Adobe Systems Inc.	 U.S.A). EGFR ubiquitination signal intensity was determined by optical density in a set area normalized against the EGFR band intensity in parallel immunoblots and expressed as a densitometric ratio of ubiquitination/EGFR levels. The mean densitometric ratio of EGFR ubiquitination	 in the presence of each CBL mutation	 was then assessed relative to wild-type CBL where the ratio was set at 1.0.  Go to: Results Cancer mutations impact CBL stability  We estimated the thermodynamic stability (unfolding free energy) changes	 Î”Î”Gfold	 upon mutation for closed (nCBL) and partially opened (CBL-S) CBL states (Fig. 1). These states did not involve binding to E2. The examination of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for random non-cancer mutations (Fig. 2A) showed that it was very similar to experimental distributions produced by random mutagenesis on a set of different proteins (35	 36). Namely	 the distribution for random non-cancer mutations was asymmetrically centered at positive energy values and there were about 10% of random mutations with highly damaging effects on CBL structures by more than 5 kcal molâˆ’1 (Fig. 2A). Despite the presence of highly damaging random mutations	 recurrent cancer mutations overall produced significantly larger destabilizing effects compared to random (p-value â‰ª 0.01) for both nCBL and CBL-S states (Fig. 2A and S1	 Table S2). This was not the case for single cancer mutations observed in only one patient (Table S2). Overall	 the form of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for recurrent cancer mutations was different from the Î”Î”Gfold distribution of random mutations (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p-value â‰ª 0.01) whereas the distribution for single cancer mutations was indistinguishable from a random mutation distribution. However	 it does not mean that all single cancer mutants can be considered passenger	 as we show later	 this is not the case for some of them.  Figure 2 Figure 2 (A) The distribution of unfolding (Î”Î”Gfold) and binding (Î”Î”Gbind) free energy changes for Single	 Recurrent and Random class mutations on nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states (see SI for other states). Positive and negative values ... The top 25% cancer mutations with the largest damaging effects are presented in Table S3. Many of them occurred in Zn-coordinating sites while many others did not involve Zn-coordination sites. Some of these latter mutations (G415V	 G413R and G415S) introduced large Van der Waals clashes with neighboring residues which could not be accommodated by side chain rearrangements	 whereas other mutations (S376F	 Y371D and L405P) affected disulfide or hydrogen bonds. For example	 L405P located in the middle of an Î±-helix affected the CBL structure by introducing an energetically unfavorable kink in the helix due to its inability to donate an amide hydrogen bond.  Effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding  The outcome of mutations can be assessed by the extent of structural changes they induce. We calculated the local root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between the minimized wild-type and mutant structures around the mutated site. We found that the protein backbone in the vicinity of a mutation of the CBL-E2 complex underwent larger local conformational changes upon recurrent cancer mutations	 especially for mutations occurring in Zn-coordinating site clusters	 compared to random mutations (p-value â‰ª 0.01	 Fig. S2 and S3). In the previous section we analyzed the original closed (nCBL) state and partially opened (CBL-S) state induced by substrate binding. In this section we study the effects of cancer mutations on two other CBL states: an autoinhibitory CBL state bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and phosphorylated active CBL state bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1) (13). Effects of mutations on binding can be in general linked with their structural locations	 therefore we examined the locations of mutations and found that about one third of all cancer mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface (Fig. S4). This preference was found to be statistically significant (p-value â‰ª 0.01) (Fig. S4).  It was previously experimentally shown that binding between CBL and E2 was rather weak with a micromolar dissociation constant (13). Despite the fact that the interface between CBL and E2 in the inactive state is several residues larger than in the active state	 consistent with experiments	 we found somewhat stronger binding between CBL and E2 for the active state of CBL (Table S4). Similarly to the impacts of cancer mutations on stability	 recurrent (but not single) mutations destabilized CBL-E2 binding significantly (Fig. 2B	 S1 and Table S2). Importantly	 cancer mutations reduced the CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state (p-value = 0.002) (Fig. 2B) and the effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding of the active state were noticeably larger compared to random mutations even if we excluded mutations in Zn-coordinating sites (Table S2). This latter observation does not hold true for the autoinhibitory CBL-E2-S conformation.  Next	 all cancer mutations were ranked with respect to their effects on CBL-E2 binding. About half of all highly damaging mutations (top 25% of most damaging mutations	 Table S3) impacted both stability and CBL-E2 binding for all four CBL states. Among them	 several mutations occurred in Zn-coordinating clusters and M400 and L405 sites. Another class of mutations (involving W408 and R420 sites) mostly influenced CBL-E2 binding. For example	 the W408S mutation caused the largest perturbation in CBL-E2 binding of the active state by decreasing binding affinity up to 3.5 kcal molâˆ’1 but having a moderate effect on stability of the nCBL and CBL-S states. It was previously suggested that amino acids in positions W408 and I383 constituted specificity of CBL-E2 binding and corresponded to binding hot spots (10	 12). Mutations in the I383 site are not recorded in the COSMIC database although they have a profound destabilizing effect on CBL-E2 binding for both states (see data for random mutations on the ftp site ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/panch/CBL). Another site affecting binding of CBL (R420) is a highly conserved site in the CBL family	 it strongly interacts with the Q92	 W93 and S94 residues of E2. It was previously experimentally verified that mutations in this site disrupted the CBL activity and could be associated with cytokine-independent growth (37). There are 24 cancer patient samples where mutations of this site (R420Q	 R420L and R420P) are found and they all produce strong destabilizing effects on the active pCBL-E2-S state.  According to the zygosity annotation	 there are 49 heterozygous (â€œHeteroâ€) and 27 homozygous (â€œHomoâ€) mutations (Table S1) and for the rest of cancer mutations their zygocity status is undetermined. Overall	 we found that destabilizing mutations were enriched among homozygous compared to heterozygous mutations for all stages of CBL activation cycle (p-value = 0.021 â€“ 0.035) and were more prevalent in leukemia compared to sarcoma patients (p-value = 0.000 â€“ 0.003) (Fig. 2B	 Table S2). This observation could not be attributed to the prevalence of homozygous mutations in Zn-coordinating clusters since these clusters had almost equal numbers of heterozygous and homozygous mutations. It was reported earlier that many homozygous mutations could be connected to uniparental disomy when germline heterozygosity would lead to neoplasia upon reduction to homozygosity (6	38	 39). If some patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms had germline heterozygous mutations in CBL	 then lost the wild-type CBL allele and duplicated mutant allele	 it would be possible that the damaging mutant allele would be duplicated in a cancer cell with a higher probability. Indeed	 human leukemia samples show the loss of the normal CBL allele.  CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination: comparing experiments with computational models  Next we randomly picked fifteen cancer mutations based on their predicted damaging status	 trying to equally sample highly damaging and benign mutations irrespective to their frequencies in cancer samples	 and experimentally tested the E3 activity of wild-type and mutant CBL proteins (see Methods	 Table 1). As can be seen in Fig. 3A	 in the presence of wild-type CBL	 activation of the EGFR induced more than a 10-fold increase in the ubiquitination of the EGFR compared to empty vector (endogenous CBL levels) in HEK293T cells (compare lane 4 to lane 2 in top panel of Fig. 3A). The E3 activity of wild-type CBL was mirrored by a decrease in the levels of immunoprecipitated EGFR consistent with the targeting of ubiquitinated EGFR for degradation (compare lanes 2 and 4 in second panel of Fig. 3A).  Figure 3 Figure 3 (A) EGFR ubiquitination. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant CBL proteins along with the EGFR and hemagglutinin (HA)-epitope tagged ubiquitin. The vector control and wild-type	 CBL transfectant cells were incubated ... Table 1 Table 1 Experimental relative densitometry values for HEK293T cells	 predicted changes in stability (Î”Î”Gfold kcal molâˆ’1)	 binding affinity (Î”Î”Gbind kcal molâˆ’1) and comparison with other methods for 15 experimentally ... We classified all mutations into three groups (damaging	 attenuating and benign) according to their experimental relative densitometry data and compared experimental data with the estimates produced by the computational models. The first group of damaging mutants included C396R	 H398Q	 Y371H	 K382E and C381A which completely abolished CBL activity (relative densitometry was less than 10%) (Fig. 3B) and the levels of total EGFR were not decreased by these mutants (Fig. 3A). Only two of these mutants belonged to the Recurrent class of mutations. Table 1 shows predicted and experimentally verified effects of mutations on all four CBL states. All five mutants were predicted to be damaging by stability and binding affinity calculations but the mechanisms of their action were different. C396R	 H398Q and C381A mutations disrupted Zn-coordinating clusters and had very damaging consequences according to the stability model for both nCBL and CBL-S states and damaging effects on CBL-E2 binding even though none of these mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface. On the other hand	 the K382E mutation did not affect Zn-coordination but destabilized the nCBL state. This	 in turn	 could be explained by the charge substitution that led to the disruption of the K382-E373 salt bridge within the closed state of nCBL (Figure 4 and Figure S5A). Moreover	 K382E mutation had a significant impact on CBL-E2 binding due to the disruption of a salt bridge between pY371 and K382 affecting the stability of CBL in the active state (Figure 4 and Figure S5D). No significant changes were observed for CBL-S and CBL-E2-S states (Figure S5B	C). K382E mutation was previously observed in Noonan syndrome and was speculated to affect CBL stability or binding (40). Finally	 the Y371H mutation not only abolished phosphorylation at the Y371 site but also had a profound destabilizing effect on all four states as evident from Table 1.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Structures of wild type (green) and K382E mutant (tan) are shown for nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states. Salt bridges are shown as dashed lines and in both cases mutation affects the stability by disrupting the salt bridge. The second group of mutants (M374V	 V430M	 P428L	 Q249E and double mutant S80N/H94Y) maintained the CBL activity equivalent to or greater than wild-type CBL (relative densitometry of 80% or higher) (Fig. 3B). Consistent with this	 the levels of the activated EGFR were also decreased in these samples (Fig. 3A). To confirm that the retained E3 activity of these mutants was not cell type specific	 we transfected these mutants into the non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the cervical cancer cell line Hela (Fig. S6). The S80N/H94Y and Q249E mutations were previously identified in human non-small cell lung cancers making the A549 cell line a relevant cell type to investigate the function of these CBL mutants while other cancer mutations were found in other cancer types. As in the HEK293T cells	 transfection of wild-type CBL into A549 and HeLa cells resulted in a significant increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of EGFR compared to the cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. S6). The increase in transfected CBL protein compared to endogenous CBL protein was less in HeLa than in either the A549 or HEK293T cells. Consistent with this	 the fold increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of the EGFR by wild-type CBL was smaller in Hela cells (about three fold) compared to either A549 or HEK293T cells (more than 10 fold in each). As in HEK293T cells	 the Y371H mutant did not stimulate ubiquitination compared to the vector transfected control for A549 or HeLa cells (Fig. S6A and C). The CBL mutants that were fully active in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3A and B) maintained CBL E3 activity in A549 and HeLa cells (Fig. S6). Two of these CBL mutants resulted in more ubiquitination of EGFR compared to wild type CBL. For example	 the Q249E mutant showed an increased ubiquitination of EGFR in 293T and HeLa cells while the M374V mutant resulted in higher ubiquitination levels in A549 and HeLa cells (Figure 3 and S6). Only V430M mutant was on the borderline with the densitometry ratio of 0.8. All mutations from the second group were predicted to be benign according to our computational models	 whereas V430M	 consistent with experimental data	 had a borderline destabilizing impact on CBL-E2 binding (Table 1).  Finally	 the third group constituted mutations (L399V	 G375P	 P395A and V391I) which attenuated the CBL E3 activity according to the relative densitometry data (Fig. 3B). Only one of these mutants was observed in two cancer samples while other three belonged to the Single mutation class. Concordant with this	 there were intermediate levels of EGFR (Fig. 3A). G375P and P395A mutations were predicted to have partially damaging effects while V391I and L399V were classified as benign in our predictions. Interestingly	 mutations from this third group affected only some of the CBL states. In contrast	 the highly damaging mutations from the first group had damaging impacts on almost all CBL states.  Next we tested if the reduction in CBL ubiquitination activity was directly correlated with the effects of mutations on stability (Fig. 5A). The relationship between experimental densitometry data and Î”Î”Gfold was better described by an exponential dependence with correlation coefficient (R) of 0.77 and 0.78 for CBL-S and nCBL states respectively (Table S5). Indeed	 the change in absorption between wild-type and mutant proteins which refers to a fraction of active mutants can be described by the Boltzmann equation relating the probability of a state with the energy of this state. A mutation may lead to damaging effects and a loss of function if it impacts at least one of the CBL functional states. Taking this into consideration we calculated the correlation between densitometry and stability changes taking a maximum of Î”Î”Gfold values for the nCBL and CBL-S states. As shown in Fig. 5A and Table S5	 changes in stability can indeed explain the effects of mutations on CBL ubiquitination activity with high correlation of R = 0.83. For comparison	 several alternative methods were applied to predict the effect of mutations on unfolding free energy	 they all reported correlation coefficients ranging from 0.21 to 0.52	 with only one method PopMusic reporting a statistically significant correlation of 0.52 (Table S5). The relationship between densitometry and binding affinity changes was on the borderline of significance with a linear correlation coefficient of 0.48 and 0.62 (if two highly damaging mutations were excluded) (Fig. 5B and Table S5).  Figure 5 Figure 5 (A) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (exponential model) and maximal predicted changes in stability. (B) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (linear model) and predicted changes in binding affinity of pCBL-E2-S state. ... There are various methods which predict the phenotypic effects of mutations	 (30â€“33	 41) and some of them use structural features (31	 41). We applied four state-of-the-art independent methods to predict the impacts of mutations on CBL function: PROVEAN (30)	 PolyPhen-2 (31)	 MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). Some of these methods outperformed our model in classifying cancer from random mutations since they were trained to distinguish disease from neutral variants (Table S6). However	 all four methods had a very limited accuracy in classifying CBL cancer mutations into those that disrupted function and those that did not. As evident from Table 1 and Table S5	 all methods except for PROVEAN over-predicted damaging effects of experimentally tested mutations while PROVEAN was the only method which produced a significant correlation between the densitometry data and PROVEANâ€™s score (R=0.58	 Table S5).  Go to: Discussion Stability-activity balance in cancer related proteins  Evolutionary selection to maintain structural	 foldable and functional proteins eliminates many mutations in protein sequences. On the other hand	 thermodynamic stability can be compromised in evolution to ensure certain arrangements of catalytic and binding sites	 which might not be energetically optimal (36	 42). In tumorigenesis	 protein stability or binding may be reduced (or in some cases increased) due to cancer mutations. As a consequence it can lead to decreased fitness at the protein level	 but may confer a fitness advantage for the population of tumor cells (43	 44). However	 the extent of the stability-activity tradeoff in oncogenes and tumor suppressors remains largely unknown. Using the example of the CBL protein	 here we tried to elucidate the stability-activity balance and to understand whether the loss or gain of activity in cancer-related proteins can be accompanied by compromised stability or binding.  In contrast to many other computational studies	 which attempt to link stability with activity by mostly focusing on one protein conformation	 we performed an analysis on four different stages of the CBL activation cycle. Our predictions of changes in stability and binding were further elucidated by the experimental CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays. We found a strong relationship between the effects of mutations on CBL stability and experimentally obtained densitometry data (quantifying activity)	 while a relatively weaker correlation was observed between changes in densitometry and CBL-E2 binding affinity. It could be explained either by a less significant impact of experimentally tested mutations on CBL-E2 binding or by a limited coupling (compared to CBL stability) between CBL-E2 binding and E3 activity.  Drivers or passengers?  According to our study	 about two thirds of all experimentally tested mutations either completely abolished or attenuated E3 activity	 while one third of them were neutral. Trying to assess the limitations of our models	 we applied state-of- the-art methods commonly used to predict functional effects of mutations. However	 these methods failed to distinguish inactivating from neutral mutations as accurately as the computational models which were solely based on accounting for the effects on stability and binding for different CBL states. Indeed	 many methods are not specifically designed to discriminate driver from passenger mutations within the pool of cancer mutations	 but rather they perform a task of distinguishing cancer from neutral mutations.  Certainly	 the large majority of all mutations detected in cancer genomics studies are likely to be neutral although the collective burden of passenger mutations may also alter the course of tumorigenesis (45). When we analyzed the distribution of all single cancer missense mutations observed in the CBL gene	 their average effects on stability or binding were not found to be significantly different from the pool of random mutations. These mutations either mostly constitute true passenger mutations or their oncogenic mechanisms are not directly connected to protein destabilization. The story is quite the opposite for the recurrent mutations as they have on average significantly higher destabilizing effects than random mutations and the majority of them should be drivers. An interesting group of mutations includes those which are highly damaging but found only in one cancer sample (10% of all single cancer mutations). These mutations may represent either rare driver or latent driver mutations (46). Several of these mutations were experimentally tested and are listed in Table 1.  CBL-E2 binding in deciphering the mechanisms of cancer  Our analysis showed that cancer mutations reduce CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state. It is in contrast to the stability-activity tradeoff reported for EGFR and other cancer related proteins (47)	 where cancer mutations may disrupt autoinhibitory interactions and activate the kinase (48	 49). Importantly	 all mutations with experimentally tested high inactivating effects have impacts on both CBL stability and CBL-E2 binding (Table 1). In fact	 the correlation between Î”Î”Gfold and Î”Î”Gbind for CBL cancer mutations from COSMIC is positive (R = 0.20 â€“ 0.48 depending on the CBL state	 p-value < 0.05). It might seem counterintuitive as some residues maintain stability by sustaining the RING-TKBD autoinhibitory interactions within CBL. This interface overlaps with the CBL-E2 interface and competes against E2 binding (13). One might think that disruption of RING-TKBD interactions and destabilization of CBL might facilitate binding to E2 and therefore lead to CBL activation. A slight activation was actually observed for two mutants	 one of which (M374V) was directly located on the CBL-E2 interface. However	 as we showed through the positive high correlation between stability and activity changes	 this mechanism is rarely observed and the vast majority of mutations disrupt CBL-E3 activity by either destabilizing CBL and/or CBL-E2 binding or by directly affecting phosphorylation of the critical tyrosine Y371.  Overall	 our results support the idea that decrease of E3 activity	 of the ability to ubiquitinate receptor tyrosine kinases	 of CBL stability and/or CBL-E2 binding can give a selective advantage for tumor cells. However	 there are several factors that complicate deciphering the mechanisms of action of CBL cancer mutations. CBL mutations can be dominant-negative and mutated CBL might not only change the CBL E3 activity but also might affect the concentration and activity of the wild-type CBL. According to a ratiometric method to identify driver genes in cancer (1)	 CBL can be regarded as an oncogene since it has several mutation hot spots. On the other hand	 as shown in our study and in other studies	 cancer driver mutations can inactivate the E3 activity of CBL	 so it can also be regarded as a tumor suppressor. Although the latter fact complicates the development of CBL targeted therapies	 understanding the delicate balance among different CBL-affected pathways may facilitate the indirect drug targeting of damaged CBL proteins. The current genetics-based frameworks to analyze cancer genome-wide sequence data are necessary but not sufficient for understanding the processes of carcinogenesis and developing informed	 targeted therapies. Our approach	 which can be applied in general to different proteins of interest	 emphasizes the importance of the physics of binding and protein conformational ensembles in deducing the mechanisms of cancer.  																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			
4	15||Noonan syndrome is an autosomal dominant congenital disorder that encompasses effects on multiple organ systems	 including distinctive facial features	 heart defects	 a short stature	 learning difficulties	 a predisposition to malignancies	 and other clinical manifestations [Roberts et al.	 2013]. It belongs to a group of genetic syndromes	 the RASopathies or RAS pathway disorders	 which are caused by mutations in genes that encode proteins involved in RAS-MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathways [Zenker	 2011]. Germline mutations in PTPN11	 SOS1	 KRAS	 NRAS	 RAF1	 BRAF	 MAP2K1	 or RIT1 underlie Noonan syndrome [Aoki et al.	 2013; Roberts et al.	 2013]. Disease-causing mutations usually enhance signal flow through RAS-MAPK cascades [Schubbert et al.	 2007]. Moreover	 mutations in two genes	 SHOC2 and CBL (MIM# 165360)	 have been reported in patients with Noonan-like phenotypes and additional untypical features [Cordeddu et al.	 2009; Martinelli et al.	 2010; Niemeyer et al.	 2010; Perez et al.	 2010]. Besides	 somatic CBL mutations have been found in various myeloproliferative disorders [Caligiuri et al.	 2007; Sargin et al.	 2007; Loh et al.	 2009; Makishima et al.	 2009; Muramatsu et al.	 2010].  CBL (also known as c-Cbl) is a multifunctional adaptor protein with ubiquitin ligase (E3) activity	 thereby catalyzing ubiquitylation of substrate proteins [Schmidt and Dikic	 2005]. CBL function has been implicated in ligand-mediated internalization and postendocytic sorting of various cell-surface proteins such as the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) [Piper and Lehner	 2011]	 which is a major cellular access to the RAS-MAPK signaling highway. In the present model	 CBL is recruited to the activated EGFR directly by interaction with the receptor at a phosphotyrosine residue [Levkowitz et al.	 1999] and indirectly through the adaptor protein Grb2 [Waterman et al.	 2002; Jiang et al.	 2003]. E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes are then recruited to the RING domain of CBL to promote receptor ubiquitylation; subsequently	 ubiquitin-binding proteins (e.g.	 Epsin) and other endocytic proteins (e.g.	 AP-2) attach and mediate EGFR internalization [Sorkin and Goh	 2009]. After trafficking into endosomes	 EGFR can either be recycled back to the plasma membrane or transported into lysosomes for degradation	 and ubiquitylation of EGFR is a prerequisite for degradative receptor sorting	 a process also called receptor downregulation [Sorkin and Goh	 2009]. Cells use EGFR internalization and sorting into a functional degradative pathway in order to attenuate the magnitude and duration of signaling events [Sorkin and Goh	 2009]. Thus	 CBL negatively regulates EGFR-RAS-MAPK signal traffic downstream of EGFR by controlling receptor internalization and degradation.  For the presented report	 our main objectives were to determine the functional consequences of pathogenic CBL mutations affecting evolutionary conserved amino acids on EGFR ubiquitylation and trafficking and to relate these data to RAS-MAPK pathway dysregulation in Noonan syndrome and other RASopathies. Materials and Methods  Plasmids  We used a human wild-type CBL construct (RefSeq: NM_005188.3) as a template and CBL-specific PCR primers to generate a wild-type CBL cDNA amplicon by PCR. Mutant CBL constructs were established by PCR-mediated mutagenesis. Purified PCR amplicons (CBLWT	 CBLC381A	 CBLK382E	 CBLD390Y	 and CBLR420Q) were cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO (Life Technologies	 Darmstadt	 Germany) according to the protocol provided. Constructs were sequenced for integrity and used for the transfer into GATEWAYâ„¢-compatible destination vector pcDNA3-DEST	 following the manufacturer's instructions. Wild-type CBL construct was a gift from Mirko Schmidt (Goethe University School of Medicine	 Frankfurt am Main	 Germany). Wild-type pcDNA3-EGFR construct (RefSeq: NM_005228.3) was a gift of Dr. Sarah J. Parsons (University of Virginia	 Charlottesville	 VA). pRK5-HA-ubiquitin (RefSeq: NM_021009.5) was purchased from Addgene (plasmid 17608). Cell culture and transfection  COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS; PAA Laboratories	 CÃ¶lbe	 Germany) and penicillin-streptomycin (100 U/ml and 100 Î¼g/ml	 respectively; Life Technologies) and incubated at 37Â°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with pcDNA3-DEST-CBL constructs using Lipofectamineâ„¢2000 Reagent (Life Technologies) or TurboFectâ„¢ (Thermo Scientific	 Bonn	 Germany) according to manufacturer's protocols. Immunoblotting  After transfection with expression constructs	 cells were incubated under serum-starved (0.1% FBS) conditions overnight. Next morning	 cells were stimulated with 10 or 20 ng/ml EGF (Sigmaâ€“Aldrich	 Taufkirchen	 Germany) for different times or left untreated. Cells were washed with ice-cold 1Ã— PBS and harvested in modified RIPA (radioimmunoprecipitation assay) buffer (150 mM NaCl	 50 mM Trisâ€“HCl	 pH 8.0	 0.5% sodium desoxycholate [w/v]	 1% Nonidet P40 [v/v]	 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate [w/v]) containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche	 Mannheim	 Germany) and	 if applicable	 phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche) or N-ethylmaleimide (Sigmaâ€“Aldrich). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 21	000 g for 10 min at 4Â°C and protein solutions were supplemented with sample buffer. Proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF (polyvinylidene difluoride) membranes. Following blocking (20 mM Trisâ€“HCl	 pH 7.4; 150 mM NaCl; 0.1% Tween-20; 4% nonfat dry milk) and washing (20 mM Trisâ€“HCl	 pH 7.4; 150 mM NaCl; 0.1% Tween-20) membranes were incubated in primary antibody solution (20 mM Trisâ€“HCl	 pH 7.4; 150 mM NaCl; 0.1% Tween-20; 5% BSA or 0.5% nonfat dry milk) containing the appropriate antibodies. Next	 membranes were washed and incubated with peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody. After final washing	 immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Millipore	 Schwalbach	 Germany). Antibodies and reagents  Following primary antibodies and dilutions were used: rabbit anti-Cbl (C-15	 WB 1:1	000; IF 1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology	 Heidelberg	 Germany); rabbit anti-EGFR (clone 1005	 WB 1:300; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); rat anti-HA-HRP (WB 1:12	000; Roche); rabbit anti-p44/42 MAP kinase (ERK 1/2	 approved protein symbols MAPK3 and MAPK1) antibody (WB 1:1	000; Cell Signaling Technology	 Danvers	 MA)	 rabbit anti-phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase (pERK 1/2) (Thr202/Tyr204) antibody (WB 1:1	000; Cell Signaling Technology)	 mouse anti-Î±-tubulin antibody (clone DM 1A; WB 1:7	500; Sigmaâ€“Aldrich). As secondary antibodies	 horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (1:5	000â€“1:30	000 dilution; GE Healthcare	 Munich	 Germany) were used. Further reagents used are as follows: Cycloheximide (10 Î¼g/ml; Sigmaâ€“Aldrich)	 N-ethylmaleimide (10 mM; Sigmaâ€“Aldrich)	 EGF complexed with Alexa Fluor 488 (100 ng/ml; Life Technologies)	 and unlabelled human EGF (10 ng/ml or 20 ng/ml; Sigmaâ€“Aldrich). High EGF concentrations were chosen because only higher concentrations of EGF (>10 ng/ml) induce nonclathrin-mediated endocytosis (NCE) in addition to clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) [Sigismund et al.	 2008; Sigismund et al.	 2013]. Notably	 EGFR ubiquitylation seems to be indispensable for NCE [Sigismund et al.	 2013]	 but not for CME [Madshus and Stang	 2009; Sorkin and Goh	 2009; Haglund and Dikic	 2012; Sigismund et al.	 2012]. Biotinylation-based EGFR cell surface assay  COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with CBL expression constructs and incubated under serum-starved (0.1% FBS) culture conditions overnight. Next day	 cells were stimulated with starvation medium supplemented with 10 ng/ml EGF for 30 min or left untreated. Subsequently	 cells were transferred on ice and washed three times with ice-cold HBSS (Life Technologies). Next	 cell surface proteins were biotinylated using 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-SS biotin (Thermo Scientific Pierce	 Bonn	 Germany) in HBSS for 15 min at 4Â°C. Unbound biotin was removed by washing twice with ice-cold HBSS containing 5 mM Trisâ€“HCl (pH 7.4) followed by rinsing with PBS. Subsequent to biotinylation	 cells were harvested in ice-cold RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Aliquots of the total cell lysates were kept for immunoblotting and the remaining supernatants were subjected to precipitation with streptavidin agarose (Sigmaâ€“Aldrich) overnight at 4Â°C. Biotin-labeled surface EGFR fractions coupled to agarose beads were collected by centrifugation for 1 min at 8	000 g at 4Â°C	 and agarose pellets were washed twice with ice-cold RIPA buffer. Precipitates and total cell lysates were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels	 transferred to PVDF membranes	 and subjected to immunodetection. Biotinylation-based EGFR internalization assay  COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with CBL expression constructs and incubated under serum-starved (0.1% FBS) culture conditions overnight. Cells were transferred to ice	 rinsed three times with ice-cold HBSS	 and cell surface proteins were biotinylated using 0.5 mg/ml biotin (Thermo Scientific Pierce) in HBSS for 15 min at 4Â°C. Unbound biotin was quenched by washing three times with 5 mM Trisâ€“HCl (pH 7.4) in HBSS. Internalization of biotinylated EGF receptors was induced by stimulation with 10 ng/ml EGF in prewarmed starvation medium (0.1% FBS) for 30 min at 37Â°C. To stop endocytosis and remove remaining cell surface-bound biotin	 cells were transferred on ice and immediately covered and washed with ice-cold glutathione-containing buffer (50 mM glutathione	 1 mM EDTA	 75 mM NaCl	 10% FBS [v/v]	 75 mM NaOH). After washing with ice-cold PBS	 cells were lysed in RIPA buffer; as controls and to demonstrate the efficiency of biotin-stripping	 unstimulated cultures were lysed in RIPA buffer. Biotinylated proteins were precipitated using streptavidin-conjugated agarose beads; intracellular EGFR fractions were collected in the precipitates. After washing precipitates with RIPA buffer	 both total cell lysates and precipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting. EGFR degradation assay  COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with CBL expression constructs and incubated under serum-starved (0.1% FBS) culture conditions overnight. Next day	 cells were incubated with 10 Î¼g/ml cycloheximide in starvation medium for 30 min to block protein synthesis. Then	 parallel cultures were stimulated by incubation in starvation medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml EGF for 60	120	 or 240 min at 37Â°C. As controls	 parallel cultures were harvested without EGF stimulation. Cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and lysed with ice-cold RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl	 1% Nonidet P40 [v/v]	 0.5% sodium deoxycholate [w/v]	 0.1% SDS [w/v]	 50 mM Tris	 pH 8). Finally	 lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Immunocytochemistry  COS-7 cells were cultivated on coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine and transiently transfected with CBL expression constructs. To visualize EGFR localization	 cells were serum-starved overnight and stimulated with 100 ng/ml fluorescently labeled EGF in starvation medium (0.1% FBS) for 30 min. Subsequently	 cells were rinsed with PBS	 fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigmaâ€“Aldrich) in PBS	 and washed three times with PBS. After treatment with permeabilization/blocking solution (2% BSA	 3% goat serum	 0.5% Nonidet P40 in PBS)	 cells were incubated in antibody solution (3% goat serum and 0.1% Nonidet P40 in PBS) containing rabbit anti-Cbl (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) primary antibody. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor Dyes; Life Technologies) in antibody solution. After extensive washing with PBS	 cells were embedded in mounting solution (25% Mowiol 4â€“88 in PBS mixed with 5% propyl gallate in PBS/glycerol in a ratio of 4:1) on microscopic slides. Cells were examined with a Leica DMIRE2 confocal microscope equipped with an HCX PL APO 63Ã—/1.32 oil immersion objective lens. Quantification of EGF488 signals was performed using Image J software. EGFR ubiquitylation assay  COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with CBL expression constructs together with HA-tagged ubiquitin and EGFR expression constructs. Transfected cells were incubated under serum-starved (0.1% FBS) culture conditions overnight. Next day	 cells were stimulated with starvation medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml EGF for 30 min at 37Â°C. Cells were washed with ice-cold 1Ã— PBS and harvested in ice-cold RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail and 10 mM N-ethylmaleimide (Sigmaâ€“Aldrich) to inhibit deubiquitylating enzymes. Next	 the cell debris was removed by centrifugation and aliquots of the total cell lysates were kept for immunoblotting. The remaining supernatants were incubated with 1 Î¼g of anti-EGFR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 hr at 4Â°C	 followed by incubation with protein A-agarose beads (Roche) overnight at 4Â°C. EGFR coupled to agarose beads were collected by centrifugation for 30 sec at 12	000g at 4Â°C	 and agarose pellets were washed three times with ice-cold Triton lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100 [v/v]	 150 mM NaCl	 5 mM EDTA	 50 mM HEPES	 pH 7.5) supplemented with 0.05% (w/v) SDS. Precipitates and total cell lysates were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels	 transferred to PVDF membranes	 and subjected to immunodetection. Scanning densitometry and statistical analysis  Signals on microscopic images and on autoradiographs were quantified by densitometric analysis using the ImageJ software (NIH; http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/index.html). Relative EGF488 and EGFR levels were assessed as described in the figure legends. One-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were used to compare means of all conditions (CBL protein variants) for statistical significance. Means were considered significant different at P value <0.05. Subsequently	 post hoc two-tailed unpaired Student's t-tests were used to determine statistical significance of the difference of the mean values between two conditions each (i.e.	 CBLWT versus CBLC381A	 CBLK382E	 CBLD390Y	 or CBLR420Q). Values are presented as the mean Â± SD and were considered significant different at P value <0.05. Results  CBL missense mutations in patients with Noonan syndrome-like phenotypes affect amino acids within the linker-RING finger domain [Martinelli et al.	 2010; Niemeyer et al.	 2010; Perez et al.	 2010] (Fig. 1A). Since an intact RING finger domain is essential for both ligand-mediated internalization and degradation of the EGFR [Sorkin and Goh	 2009]	 we analyzed functional consequences of three disease-associated CBL amino acid changes within this domain (Fig. 1A).  Figure 1.  Figure 1. Open in figure viewerDownload Powerpoint slide Modular architecture of CBL and consequences of CBL mutants on EGFR surface levels. A: CBL protein domains and motifs. The total number of amino acids (aa) is given. Tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain (aa 47â€“345)	 linker sequence (linker	 aa 346â€“380)	 RING finger domain (RING	 aa 381â€“423)	 proline-rich region (ProR	 aa 481â€“688)	 and ubiquitin-associated domain (UBA	 aa 857â€“894) are schematically shown. Amino acid substitutions analyzed in this study are indicated. B: p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q amino acid changes compromise CBL function during removal of surface EGFR. COS-7 cells transiently expressing the indicated CBL protein variants or transfected with empty vector (mock) were cultured under serum-starved conditions overnight. Next day	 cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml EGF for 30 min (30 min tEGF) at 37Â°C or left untreated (0 min tEGF). Subsequently	 surface proteins were biotinylated at 4Â°C and precipitated from cell extracts by using streptavidin-conjugated agarose beads. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-EGFR antibodies. Representative autoradiographs show EGFR levels in total cell lysates (tcl) and precipitates (pcpt). Expression of CBL protein variants in total cell lysates was monitored by immunoblotting using anti-CBL antibodies and anti-tubulin antibodies were used to control for equal loading. C: Densities of autoradiographic signals obtained from experiments as described in (B) were quantified by scanning densitometry. Amounts of surface EGFR (i.e.	 precipitated EGFR) was normalized to total EGFR and considered as 100% for unstimulated parallel cultures (0 min tEGF). Thus	 surface EGFR upon EGF stimulation (30 min tEGF) is expressed as percentage of surface EGFR in unstimulated cells. Data represent the mean of n independent experiments Â± SD. One-way ANOVA between groups: P > 0.05 (not significant). Post hoc testing was not performed. CBL amino acid changes p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q alter cellular EGFR distribution  If CBL mutations interfere with EGFR internalization	 the amount of surface and intracellular EGFR should be altered in cells expressing mutant CBL proteins. Therefore	 we determined the level of surface and intracellular EGFR in cells stimulated with EGF for 30 min by using surface biotinylation-based assays. Expression of CBLWT resulted in a clear reduction of surface EGFR upon EGF stimulation (Fig. 1B	 CBLWT	 precipitates	 30 min) relative to unstimulated cells (Fig. 1B	 CBLWT	 precipitates	 0 min). In contrast	 transfection of cells with CBL mutants (Fig. 1B; CBLK382E	 CBLD390Y	 or CBLR420Q) or with empty vector (Fig. 1B	 mock) did not induce marked alterations of surface EGFR levels (Fig. 1B	 compare precipitates for 0 and 30 min each). In line with this	 CBLC381A	 a RING finger mutant (Fig. 1A) that has already been shown to perturb EGFR internalization [Waterman et al.	 1999; Thien et al.	 2001] and that we used as an internal control	 also did not stimulate removal of surface EGFR (Fig. 1B). Densitometric measurements and statistical analysis revealed that only 55.6% of initial EGFR (unstimulated cells) remained at the surface of cells ectopically expressing CBLWT; however	 cells expressing mutant CBL variants or mock-transfected cells displayed between 73.8% and 88.1% of initial EGFR at the cell surface after 30-min EGF treatment (Fig. 1C). Thus	 CBLWT may promote EGF-induced EGFR internalization	 whereas mutations associated with Noonan syndrome-like phenotypes (p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q) as well as the established RING finger mutation p.C381A may compromise this CBL effect. Even though differences of mean values did not reach statistical significance in these experiments by using one-way ANOVA (data not shown)	 a tendency for impaired removal of surface EGFR caused by CBL mutations is obvious. Indeed	 we could substantiate our results by the determination of the amounts of intracellular EGFR after ligand stimulation. CBLWT overexpression resulted in a marked enrichment of the intracellular EGFR fraction upon 30-min EGF treatment (Fig. 2A	 blots on the left-hand side	 precipitates	 30 min) indicating efficient ligand-induced EGFR internalization. Cells expressing any of the tested CBL mutants (CBLK382E	 CBLD390Y	 CBLR420Q	 or CBLC381A) showed slightly decreased levels of intracellular EGFR relative to CBLWT-expressing cells (Fig. 2A	 autoradiographs on the left-hand side	 precipitates	 30 min). Mock-transfected cells also showed reduced amounts of internalized EGFR compared to CBLWT-expressing cells (Fig. 2A	 autoradiographs on the right-hand side	 precipitates; [note: all bands on these autoradiographs represent results after 30-min EGF stimulation]). On the other hand	 CBL mutants seemed to have even less intracellular EGFR upon 30-min EGF stimulation than mock-transfected cells (Fig. 2A	 autoradiographs on the right-hand side	 precipitates). By densitometric measurements and statistical analysis of several independent experiments	 we could prove that expression of mutant CBL variants resulted in significantly decreased ligand-induced internalization of EGFR compared to CBLWT-expressing cells by about 25%â€“33% (Fig. 2B). These data suggest loss-of-function consequences of disease-associated CBL amino acid changes. Interestingly	 mock transfection led to intermediate amounts of intracellular EGFR	 minus 15% compared to CBLWT but about plus 15% compared to CBL mutants (Fig. 2B)	 which may indicate that CBL mutations exert additional dominant-negative effects on EGFR internalization. To confirm our observations by microscopic analysis	 we stimulated COS-7 cells with fluorescently labeled EGF (EGF488) for 30 min (Fig. 3). For these analyses	 we used anti-CBL antibodies	 which recognize ectopically expressed as well as endogenous CBL protein; thus	 untransfected cells and cells expressing very low levels of CBL protein variants cannot be differentiated and both are considered as control cells. Strong expression of CBLWT resulted in increased intracellular EGF488 compared to control cells on the same specimen (Fig. 3A). In contrast	 cells strongly expressing CBLK382E	 CBLD390Y	 CBLR420Q	 or CBLC381A showed reduced amounts of intracellular EGF488 when compared to control cells on the respective same specimen (Fig. 3A). We validated these observations by quantification	 normalization	 and statistical evaluation of immuncytochemical specimens: although expression of CBLWT strongly increased intracellular EGF488 levels	 expression of any CBL mutant decreased the amount of intracellular EGF488 (Fig. 3B). Taken together	 our data demonstrate that CBL amino acid changes p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q alter the cellular distribution of EGFR and we suggest that impaired EGFR internalization underlies this defect.

A: COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with CBL expression constructs or with empty vector (mock) as indicated and cultured under serum-starved conditions overnight. Next day	 surface proteins were biotinylated at 4Â°C and	 subsequently	 stimulated with 10 ng/ml EGF for 30 min (30 min tEGF) at 37Â°C or left untreated (0 min tEGF). Cells were transferred on ice	 remaining cell surface bound biotin was removed	 and cells were harvested. Internalized biotinylated proteins were precipitated with streptavidin-conjugated agarose and samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. To represent each CBL protein variant at least once	 autoradiographs from two different experiments are shown. To demonstrate the efficiency of biotin stripping	 the autoradiographs on the left-hand side also show the levels of precipitated EGFR in unstimulated (0 min tEGF) cells. EGFR levels in total cell lysates (tcl) and precipitates (pcpt) were determined using anti-EGFR antibodies	 expression of CBL protein variants in total cell lysates was monitored by using anti-CBL antibodies	 and anti-tubulin antibodies were used to control for equal loading. B: Autoradiographic signals obtained from experiments as described in (A) were quantified by scanning densitometry. Amount of intracellular EGFR (i.e.	 precipitated EGFR) was normalized to total EGFR and considered as 100% for CBLWT-expressing cells at 30 min tEGF. Thus	 internalized EGFR upon 30-min EGF stimulation is expressed as percentage of internalized EGFR in CBLWT-expressing cells. Data represent the mean of n independent experiments Â± SD. One-way ANOVA between groups: P < 0.05. Post hoc P values were calculated by unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001. Figure 3.  Figure 3.

Extracellular receptor-bound EGF488 was removed and cells were fixed.

All images were taken under the same magnification and laser intensity settings.

CBL amino acid changes p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q impair CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitylation and abrogate the stimulating effect of CBL on EGFR degradation  The CBL RING finger domain is central to the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity [Zheng et al.	 2000]	 and CBL-mediated ubiquitylation strongly affects the postendocytic EGFR fate by lysosomal targeting and subsequent degradation of ubiquitylated receptors [Swaminathan and Tsygankov	 2006; Sorkin and Goh	 2009]. First	 we monitored the capacity of wild-type and mutant CBL proteins to ubiquitylate EGFR upon 30-min EGF stimulation by using precipitation-based ubiquitylation assays. Overexpression of CBLWT resulted in a strong ubiquitylation signal in EGFR precipitates (Fig. 4A	 top panel; CBLWT) relative to mock-transfected cells (Fig. 4A	 top panel; mock). In contrast	 transfection of cells with CBL mutants associated with Noonan-like phenotypes did not result in augmented EGFR ubiquitylation (Fig. 4A	 top panel; CBLK382E	 CBLD390Y	 or CBLR420Q). Similarly	 cells expressing ubiquitylation-deficient CBLC381A [Waterman et al.	 1999; Thien et al.	 2001] showed slightly lower levels of ubiquitylated EGFR than CBLWT cells (Fig. 4A	 top panel; CBLC381A and CBLWT). Perfectly in line with the function of ubiquitin-labeling as a trigger for degradation [Swaminathan and Tsygankov	 2006; Sorkin and Goh	 2009]	 the total amount of EGFR in cells expressing CBLWT was markedly decreased (Fig. 4A	 second and third panel). These representative data from one out of three independent experiments strongly indicate that disease-associated CBL amino acid changes p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q abrogate CBL ubiquitin ligase activity. To measure the impact of CBL mutations on EGFR degradation	 we determined the amounts of total EGFR upon 60	120	 and 240 min of EGF stimulation. Ectopic expression of CBLWT induced a rapid loss of cellular EGFR within 60 min of EGF stimulation followed by constant EGFR levels over the rest of the observation period (Fig. 4B); this indicates that EGFR is subject to effective degradation. In contrast	 in cells transfected with empty vector	 EGFR levels slowly decreased over the time	 starting with a slight reduction of EGFR at 60 min to a marked loss at 240 min of EGF treatment (Fig. 4B). Cells expressing CBLK382E	 CBLD390Y	 or CBLR420Q showed very similar EGFR degradation kinetics to that of mock-transfected cells (Fig. 4B)	 which indicates loss of the stimulating effect of CBL on EGFR degradation. Interestingly	 it seemed that expression of CBLC381A most effectively blocks EGFR degradation (Fig. 4B). We verified these observations by densitometric measurements and statistical analysis of several independent experiments (Fig. 4C): CBLWT induced a reduction to 30.8% of initial EGFR after 60-min EGF stimulation	 whereas mock transfection or expression of CBLK382E	 CBLD390Y	 or CBLR420Q resulted in a decrease to 69.0%	68.80%	74.90%	 and 64.2% of initial EGFR	 respectively (Fig. 4C). These data demonstrate that the promoting effect of CBLWT on EGFR degradation is impaired by disease-associated mutations p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q. Notably	 the control mutant CBLC381A strongly delayed EGFR degradation with only 20% of initial EGFR amounts having been degraded at 240 min upon EGF treatment (Fig. 4C). This may indicate additional negative consequences of the p.C381A change on EGFR trafficking.  Figure 4.  Figure 4.

COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with CBL expression constructs (as indicated) or with empty vector (mock) together with HA-tagged ubiquitin and EGFR expression constructs. Subsequent to incubation under serum-starved culture conditions overnight	 cells were stimulated with 20 ng/ml EGF for 30 min (tEGF) and harvested in ice-cold RIPA buffer containing 10 mM N-ethylmaleimide to inhibit deubiquitylating enzymes. EGFR was immunoprecipitated with anti-EGFR antibodies and protein A-agarose and samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Levels of ubiquitylated EGFR in precipitates (ip) were monitored by using anti-HA antibodies. EGFR levels in total cell lysates (tcl) and precipitates (ip) were determined by using anti-EGFR antibodies and expression of CBL protein variants in total cell lysates was shown by using anti-CBL antibodies. Representative blots from one out of three independent experiments are shown. B and C: EGFR degradation. B: COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with CBL expression constructs or with empty vector (mock) as indicated and cultured under serum-starved conditions overnight. Next day	 cells were treated with 10 Î¼g/ml cycloheximide for 30 min to block protein synthesis and	 subsequently	 stimulated with 20 ng/ml EGF for 60	120	 or 240 min (tEGF) at 37Â°C or left untreated (0 min tEGF). Cell extracts (tcl) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-EGFR antibodies. Anti-tubulin antibodies were used to control for equal loading	 and the expression of CBL protein variants in total cell lysates was monitored by using anti-CBL antibodies; note that the gradually reduction of CBL protein expression after EGF treatment has been reported previously [Schmidt et al.	 2006]. C: Autoradiographic signals obtained from experiments as described in (B) were quantified by scanning densitometry. Amounts of EGFR in unstimulated cells (0 min tEGF) were considered as 100% and EGFR levels upon EGF stimulation (60	120	 and 240 min tEGF) are expressed as percentage of EGFR in unstimulated cells (0 min tEGF). Data represent the mean of n independent experiments Â± SD. One-way ANOVA between groups: P60 min < 0.05	 P120 min < 0.05	 P240 min < 0.05. Post hoc P values were calculated by unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01. Disease-associated mutations disrupt the ability of CBL to attenuate RAS-MAPK signaling  RASopathies are caused by hyperstimulation of RAS-MAPK signaling cascades [Aoki et al.	 2008]. Therefore	 by measuring ERK phosphorylation levels in COS-7 cells	 we determined activation of ERK proteins	 which are well-defined key players in RAS-MAPK signaling [Dhillon et al.	 2007]. We documented a time course for ERK phosphorylation upon EGF stimulation and we found no statistically significant differences after 10- and 30-min EGF stimulation between cells expressing CBLWT and either cells expressing disease-associated CBL protein variant or mock-transfected cells (Fig. 5A and B). At 60 min upon EGF stimulation	 cells expressing CBLWT showed reduced ERK1/2 phosphorylation compared with mock-transfected cells; however	 cells expressing CBLC381A	 CBLK382E	 CBLD390Y	 or CBLR420Q did not (Fig. 5A and B). In fact	 phospho-ERK1/2 levels were significantly increased in CBLC381A	 CBLK382E	 CBLD390Y	 or CBLR420Q cells relative to CBLWT-expressing cells at 60 min upon EGF stimulation (Fig. 5A and B). Quantification revealed between 1.43-fold and 2.24-fold higher ERK phosphorylation levels in cells expressing CBL mutant proteins or in mock-transfected cells than in CBLWT-expressing cells (Fig. 5B). We conclude that amino acid changes p.C381A	 p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q abrogate the potential of CBL to attenuate RAS-MAPK signaling.  Figure 5.  Figure 5.

A: COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with CBL expression constructs (as indicated) or with empty vector (mock) and cultured under serum-starved conditions overnight. Next day	 cells were stimulated with 20 ng/Î¼l EGF for 10 (10 min tEGF)	 30 (30 min tEGF)	 or 60 (60 min tEGF) min or left untreated (0 min tEGF). Subsequently	 total cell lysates (tcl) were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) and anti-ERK1/2 antibodies. Expression of CBL protein variants was monitored by immunoblotting using anti-CBL antibodies	 and anti-tubulin antibodies were used to control for equal loading. B: Autoradiographic signals obtained from experiments as described in (A) were quantified by scanning densitometry. Levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 was normalized relative to amounts of total ERK1/2 and ERK phosphorylation in cells expressing CBLWT was considered as 1. Thus	 the graphs show phosphorylation levels in mock-transfected cells and mutant CBL-expressing cells relative to that in cells expressing CBLWT (arbitrary units (a.u.)). Data represent the mean of n independent experiments Â± SD. One-way ANOVA between groups: P < 0.05. Post hoc P values were calculated by unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001. Discussion  Here	 we provide evidence that dysfunction of EGFR trafficking contributes to a clinically variable condition out of RASopathy-spectrum disorders. Defective endocytic sorting of receptors has been already proposed as a pathomechanistic basis for Noonan syndrome related phenotypes [Martinelli et al.	 2010]. By detailed analyses	 we could now demonstrate that RASopathy-associated amino acid changes p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q in the CBL RING domain (i) derange the cellular distribution of EGFR	 (ii) interfere with CBL-mediated ubiquitylation of EGFR	 (iii) abrogate the stimulating effect of CBL on EGFR degradation	 and (iv) disrupt CBL-mediated downregulation of RAS-MAPK signaling.  EGFR is internalized through different mechanisms: non-clathrin-mediated endocytosis (NCE) and clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) [Sorkin and Goh	 2009]. EGFR ubiquitylation seems to be indispensable for NCE [Sigismund et al.	 2013]	 whereas the need of EGFR ubiquitylation for CME is discussed controversially [Madshus and Stang	 2009; Sorkin and Goh	 2009; Haglund and Dikic	 2012; Sigismund et al.	 2012]. In line with our data on CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitylation (Fig. 4A)	 recently it has been reported that the disease-associated CBL amino acid changes p.D390Y and p.R420Q result in impaired EGFR ubiquitylation in response to EGF stimulation [Martinelli et al.	 2010]; this indicates loss-of-function consequences regarding the CBL ubiquitin ligase capacity. Several reports have shown that an intact CBL linker-RING domain is essential for EGF/EGFR internalization [e.g.	 Waterman et al.	 1999; Thien et al.	 2001; Jiang and Sorkin	 2003]. Taken together	 we suggest that RASopathy-associated amino acid changes	 which disrupt the ability of CBL to ubiquitylate EGFR	 compromise EGFR internalization and	 therefore	 result in higher amounts of surface and lower amounts of intracellular EGFR (Figs. 1B and C and 2). Notably	 intracellular EGFR levels in mock-transfected cells	 which lie between those in wild-type and mutant CBL-expressing cells (Fig. 2)	 may indicate a dominant-negative effect of CBL changes p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q on EGFR internalization. Accordingly	 dominant-negative effects of myeloid neoplasm-associated CBL missense mutations (p.Q367P	 p.Y371 S	 and p.R420Q) on CBL ubiquitin ligase function and receptor endocytosis have been demonstrated [Sargin et al.	 2007; Sanada et al.	 2009]. Dominant-negative consequences could be explained by competitive binding of mutant and wild-type CBL alleles to phosphotyrosine-containing motifs of activated EGFR in the combination with the inability of mutant CBL to recruit E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes to the RING domain. This	 however	 remains to be proved.  EGFR ubiquitylation is largely devoted to commit EGFR to lysosomal degradation [Haglund and Dikic	 2012]. In line with this	 we detected rapid and efficient EGFR degradation upon ectopic expression of CBLWT	 but not in cells expressing mutant CBL protein variants (Fig. 4A and B). Since all tested RASopathy-associated CBL variants and mock-transfection caused very similar degradation kinetics	 we suggest loss-of-function consequences of p.K382E	 p.D390Y	 and p.R420Q on EGFR degradation. Interestingly	 the p.C381A mutation strongly delayed and blocked EGFR degradation. Cysteine 381 is a key residue for the binding of zinc	 an important cofactor for stabilizing the RING domain; mutations may disrupt zinc-chelating loops that accommodate significant contact with E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes [Zheng et al.	 2000]. However	 at the moment there is no valid mechanistic explanation for differing functional consequences of the p.C381A change and the RASopathy-associated mutations	 because all of these affect amino acids that seem to be essential for the formation of the binding interface for E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes [Zheng et al.	 2000; Martinelli et al.	 2010].  Noonan syndrome and related disorders are associated with dysregulated RAF-MAPK signal transduction [Schubbert et al.	 2007]. In cells expressing mutant CBL	 we detected ERK phosphorylation levels that were stronger than in CBLWT cells but similar to control cells (Fig. 5) indicating a loss of the ability to attenuate RAS-MAPK signaling. Thus	 this loss-of-function effect of RASopathy-associated CBL mutants is transformed into a gain of RAS-MAPK signaling. We conclude that inefficient degradation and affected internalization of EGFR (and possibly other CBL-regulated cell surface receptors) finally result in pronounced ligand-induced signaling events such as increased RAS-MAPK signal flux. This interrelation is well known from the pathogenesis of malignancies: enhanced RAS-MAPK signaling is common to human cancer and activating somatic mutations have been described in various genes encoding proteins of these signaling pathways [Dhillon et al.	 2007]; in addition	 somatic mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in the downregulation of receptors upstream of the RAS-MAPK signaling highway (e.g.	 CBL	 HIP1	 and TSG101) have been linked to malignancies [Bache et al.	 2004]. Consistently	 malfunction of the trafficking machinery inhibits either the early phase of receptor internalization or the transport of internalized receptor complexes toward degradation	 both of which promote the development of cancer [Dikic and Schmidt	 2007]. Taken together	 we suggest that RASopathy-associated lesions affect CBL binding with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes	 which results in loss of CBL ubiquitylation capacity and defective trafficking of EGFR (and other CBL-regulated cell surface receptors); this then again prolongs the availability of activated surface receptors in the cell	 which finally is transformed into increased RAS-MAPK signaling.  Germline CBL mutations are associated with a strikingly variable phenotype [Martinelli et al.	 2010; Niemeyer et al.	 2010; Perez et al.	 2010]	 as this is generally the case for Noonan syndrome and related disorders [Allanson et al.	 2010; Roberts et al.	 2013]. Modifier genes may explain these inter- and intragenic differences in disease expression indicating that these monogenic diseases rather are Mendelian disorders [Nadeau	 2001; Slavotinek and Biesecker	 2003; Genin et al.	 2008]. Since all the genes implicated in Noonan syndrome encode proteins integral to the EGFR-RAS-MAPK pathway	 phenocritical genetic modifiers may include genes involved in this signaling network. Remarkably	 Noonan syndrome and related disorders are caused by mutations in genes encoding more proximal components of RAS-MAPK signaling	 for example	 PTPN11 and SOS1	 whereas other RASopathies	 the cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome and Costello syndrome	 are associated with lesions in downstream components of RAS-MAPK cascades [Aoki et al.	 2008]. Therefore	 for Noonan syndrome it was proposed that in addition to RAS-MAPK signaling other downstream pathways could be affected	 which may account for the marked phenotypic variability [Roberts et al.	 2007]. Accordingly	 the position of CBL as the most upstream regulator of RAS-MAPK signaling associated with RASopathies by now may functionally explain the extreme clinical variability of patients with CBL germline mutations	 which has been reported recently [Martinelli et al.	 2010]. In this respect	 by describing a further regulatory level in the RASopathy network	 namely	 the trafficking of growth factor receptors upstream of RAS-MAPK signaling	 we underline the growing functional variability of RASopathy-associated gene lesions. Thereby	 we add important novel aspects to the knowledge of the pathophysiological basis of RASopathies	 which markedly expands the number of possible functional candidate genes for RAS-MAPK pathway associated diseases: mutations in genes coding for proteins that regulate trafficking of EGFR and other receptors upstream of RAS-MAPK signaling may account for genetically yet unclarified cases of RASopathies. This knowledge may facilitate the evaluation of genomic variants in exome data from mutation-negative patients with RASopathies and may open new pharmacogenomic approaches to rescue hyperstimulation of RAS-MAPK cascades. 																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											
1	16||To determine if residual cylindrical refractive error after cataract surgery can be adjusted using the light-adjustable lens (LAL).  Methods The LAL is a photosensitive silicone intraocular lens whose power can be adjusted post-operatively using UV light at 365 nm. A digital light delivery device (DLD) is used to adjust LAL power in situ to correct residual refractive errors non-invasively. Profiles developed to correct residual cylindrical and spherical errors were tested on five patients	 with postoperative toric refractive errors of 1.25â€“1.75 D. At 2 weeks post-implantation	 best corrected visual acuity (BCVA)	 uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) and residual refractive errors were measured.  Results Toric error was reduced in each of the patients and refractions remained stable for the 9 month follow-up period. Achieved spherical equivalent manifest refraction (MRSE) was within 0.25 D of targeted emmetropia. All five patients improved their UCVA to â‰¥20/25 (â‰¤0.1 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (LogMAR)) and maintained their BCVA.  Conclusion The LAL can be adjusted postoperatively to correct residual astigmatism.  Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal malignancies that are characterized by overproduction of immature and mature myeloid lineage cells. Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is an aggressive childhood MPN that is characterized by malignant transformation in the stem cell compartment with clonal proliferation of progeny that variably retain the capacity to differentiate1. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only cure for JMML; however	 relapse rates approach 30% (ref. 2). Although spontaneous remissions occur in some infants3	4	 the underlying mechanism for this is unknown.  Germline and somatic mutations that deregulate Ras signaling are implicated as key initiating events in JMML; 60% of affected individuals harbor an oncogenic mutation in the Ras signaling genes PTPN11	 NRAS or KRAS and another 15% have mutations in the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene (NF1) and show loss of the normal NF1 allele in leukemic cells5	6	7	8	 9. Individuals with the myeloproliferative subtype of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML)	 a similar MPN in adults	 frequently display NRAS	 KRAS and JAK2 mutations10	 11. Mouse models recapitulate these diseases	 supporting the hypothesis that hyperactive Ras is necessary and sufficient to cause MPN12	13	14	 15. A hallmark feature of JMML and CMML is the formation of abnormally high numbers of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM) in methylcellulose cultures containing low concentrations of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)16	 17. Phosphorylation of the Î²c chain of the GM-CSF receptor creates docking sites for adapters and signal relay molecules	 resulting in activation of the Ras pathway.  Samples from individuals with MPNs can show copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (acquired isodisomy) of a region on chromosome 11q and homozygous mutations in CBL18	19	20	 21. Approximately 10â€“15% of children with de novo JMML are estimated to harbor homozygous CBL mutations20	 22. CBL mutations are acquired somatically in adults with MPNs18	19	 21.  As children with NF1 and Noonan syndrome are predisposed to JMML8	9	23	24	25	 we tested whether germline CBL mutations occur in affected children. Twenty-one children with JMML were found to have CBL mutations (16 of 21 were previously included in a screen of a larger international cohort20) and an unexpectedly high percentage of these children showed developmental delay	 cryptorchidism and impaired growth (Tables 1 and 2). All children met diagnostic criteria for JMML26	 27 but six individuals who were followed up for more than seven years did not undergo transplantation for various reasons. Of these	 one died of progressive JMML (D088)	 but the MPN improved spontaneously in five others. All of these subjects continued to show variable degrees of splenomegaly in the presence of normal blood counts and had a persistent homozygous CBL mutation in CD4	 CD8	 CD14 and CD19 sorted cells from their peripheral blood at their last follow-up. In addition	 four of these subjects developed clinical signs consistent with vascular pathology	 including optic atrophy	 hypertension and an acquired cardiomyopathy; one was diagnosed with Takayasu arteritis	 type III by angiography (Fig. 1a). Another subject (D256) developed an intracranial germinoma harboring the same homozygous CBL mutation as in his bone marrow. Of note	 among the patients treated with HSCT	 there was a high rate of conversion to stable mixed chimerism (9 of 11 patients for whom data are available; Table 1).

Mutational analysis of parental DNA was informative in 13 families and confirmed autosomal inheritance of a CBL mutation in seven (Fig. 1b	c	 Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1). Subjects UPN1333 and UPN1125 were from large pedigrees in which several individuals had died of JMML (Fig. 1b	c).  The proband in family 1 (UPN1333	 V:1; Fig. 1b) was referred after transplantation for JMML. Initially diagnosed at 7 months of age	 he received his first HSCT at 13 months and then developed mixed chimerism 6 months later. A blood sample showed a homozygous CBL mutation at c.1111T>C (p.371Y>H). Importantly	 analysis of buccal swab DNA revealed a heterozygous lesion. Both maternal relatives died from progressive JMML. Peripheral blood or buccal swabs from extended family members revealed multiple heterozygous individuals (Fig. 1b). Detailed medical history from the affected maternal great-grandmother revealed a history of infant leukemia characterized by a high white blood cell count and splenomegaly that resolved spontaneously. Sorted B (CD19) and T (CD3) cells and granulocytes from her peripheral blood showed a heterozygous c.1111T>C mutation. Leukemia cells from UPN1333 showed a classic pattern of GM-CSF hypersensitivity (Fig. 1d) and increased phosphorylation of STAT5 in response to low doses of GM-CSF28. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from his heterozygous mother did not show either of these features	 suggesting that homozygosity for the mutant CBL allele is essential for these characteristics (data not shown).  The proband in family 2 (Fig. 1c; UPN1125	 IV:3) was a girl diagnosed at 15 months of age with JMML. She also harbored a homozygous c.1111T>C CBL mutation in her bone marrow. Family history revealed that her mother had two male first cousins who were diagnosed with JMML and died before age 10. Frozen liver tissue from the first boy was available from autopsy and showed a heterozygous c.1111T>C mutation. Notably	 he also developed clinical signs and laboratory test results consistent with small vessel vasculitis before his death. The mother of UPN1125 was found to carry a heterozygous CBL mutation (Fig. 1c).  Three subjects showed homozygous splice site mutations (Table 2; I066	 D647 and D347). RT-PCR showed several new splice products arising from these mutations (Fig. 2); most notable are the two splice site variants that delete either exon 8 (D347) or exon 9 (I066 and D647; Supplementary Fig. 2) or retain an interstitial intron (for example	 intron 7 for D347). Each of the deletion splice variants encodes a protein that is predicted to lack essential regions of the linker and RING finger domains	 whereas the retention of intron 7 introduces a premature stop codon to abort translation upstream of the RING finger domain.

Full size image (38 KB) Previous Figures/tables index Next To investigate the functional properties of the mutant Cbl proteins encoded by homozygous point mutations	 we first studied the effect of the common p.371Y>H substitution on the growth of primary hematopoietic cells from mouse fetal liver. This system reproduces the hypersensitivity to GM-CSF that is characteristic of JMML16	 29. Fetal liver cells transduced with retroviral vectors expressing wild-type or mutant Cbl proteins showed no increased sensitivity to GM-CSF (Fig. 3a). Similarly	 expression of p.371Y>H Cbl in a BaF3-EpoR cell line did not confer cytokine independence (Fig. 3b). Based on the observation that JMML cells invariably lose the normal CBL allele and on recent findings21	 we reasoned that reduction of Cbl expression might be mandatory to deregulate hematopoietic growth. Therefore	 we introduced a short hairpin RNA	 which reduced the expression of mouse Cbl in BaF3-EpoR cell lines (Fig. 3c). We next transduced these cells with a series of wild-type and mutant human constructs and found that exogenous Cbl was strongly expressed (Fig. 3c). In this context	 we observed cytokine-independent proliferation (Fig. 3d) upon expression of p.371Y>H Cbl or a known mouse oncogenic Cbl protein (70Z)30	31	 32. The 70Z oncogenic protein deletes 17 amino acids from position 366â€“382 in the linker domain. Furthermore	 cells transduced with p.371Y>H or 70Z showed hypersensitivity to increasing concentrations of human EPO (Fig. 3e)	 mimicking the growth factor hypersensitivity seen in JMML (Fig. 1d). In cells depleted of endogenous Cbl and expressing exogenous p.371Y>H or 70Z Cbl proteins	 we observed constitutive phosphorylation of ERK	 AKT and S6 in cells deprived of cytokine. We also found heightened responses to low doses of EPO (Fig. 3f).  Figure 3: p.371Y>H does not confer cytokine sensitivity or cytokine independent growth until silencing of mouse Cbl. p.371Y>H does not confer cytokine sensitivity or cytokine independent growth until silencing of mouse Cbl. (a) Transduction of 371Y>H or the known mouse oncogenic mutant 70Z in wild-type hematopoietic cells from fetal liver did not confer hypersensitivity to GM-CSF. (b) Expression of the same mutants in BaF3-EpoR cells did not result in cytokine-independent growth. (c) Protein blot showing that an shRNA to mouse Cbl (cbl.2364) caused near complete shutdown of expression in BaF3-EpoR cells with re-expression upon introduction of the human wild-type	 70Z or 371Y>H Cbl proteins. (d) Both the 371Y>H and 70Z Cbl mutants conferred cytokine-independent growth in the presence of cbl.2364. Controls included the Venus vector pMIV and BaF3-EpoR. Error bars for triplicate replicates (s.e.m.) are shown and when not visible	 indicate tight clustering. Using a paired t-test: cbl.2364 + WT-Cbl compared with cbl.2364 + 371Y>H at day 7	 P = 0.017; at day 9	 P < 0.001. (e) Serial transduction of the hairpin (cbl.2364) and 371Y>H or 70Z constructs also conferred hypersensitive growth when we assessed cell proliferation on day 5 in increasing concentrations of Epo. Using a paired t-test at each concentration of Epo when comparing cbl.2364 + WT-Cbl with cbl.2364 + 371Y>H: Epo 0 U/ml: P = 0.036; Epo 0.01 U/ml: P = 0.0015; Epo 0.1 U/ml: P = 0.029; Epo 1 U/ml (saturating dose)	 P = 0.697. (f) Cells containing either 371Y>H or 70Z showed activation of pERK	 pAKT and pS6 in the absence of Epo or in low dose 0.01 U/mL of Epo in comparison to negative controls. All cell proliferation work was done in triplicate.

Soon after activation	 the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) undergoes Cbl-dependent polyubiquitylation and proteosomal degradation. HEK293 cells expressing hemagglutinin-tagged (HA)-Cbl(p.371Y>H) showed markedly elevated levels of phosphorylated EGFR upon EGF stimulation in comparison to cells expressing HA-Cbl(WT) (Fig. 4a)	 which indicates a possible defect in clearance of pEGFR by Cbl(p.371Y>H). The Cbl(p.384C>R) mutant showed a similar defect in pEGFR clearance (data not shown). Upon polyubiquitylation of targets	 Cbl promotes its own polyubiquitylation and subsequent auto-degradation. Consistent with this model	 levels of Cbl(WT)	 but not of Cbl(p.371Y>H or p.384C>R)	 rapidly diminished after EGF treatment in the absence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 4a	b and data not shown	). However	 Cbl(WT) levels were stabilized in the presence of MG132 whereas Cbl(p.371Y>H) levels remained relatively high irrespective of MG132 (Fig. 4b)	 which suggests that the Cbl mutants p.371Y>H and p.384C>R have an inherent defect in E3 function. Consistent with this notion	 Cbl(WT) promoted robust polyubiquitylation of pEGFR whereas p.371Y>H and p.384C>R showed diminished capacity to polyubiquitylate pEGFR in an in vitro ubiquitylation assay (data not shown). This diminished capacity is similar to that of 70Z	 which is defective in E3 ligase activity	 and agrees with recent finidings that p.371Y>S and p.367Q>P mutants in human subjects also have diminished ubiquitylation activity21. The Y371 residue that is most commonly affected in germline CBL mutations has been the focus of extensive biochemical analysis21. This analysis supports the idea that Y371 in essential for maintaining the integrity of the alpha-helical structure of the linker region	 which has a critical role in substrate specificity. Notably	 Y371 has been found to be phosphorylated despite its predicted location away from the protein surface. Substitution of this residue with phenylalanine results in a non-oncogenic form of the protein	 which lacks E3 ligase activity. Conversely	 substitution with a glutamate constitutively activates the E3 ligase activity33	 34.  Figure 4: Cbl mutant proteins show prolonged protein turnover and are associated with increased phosphorylated EGFR upon EGF stimulation. Cbl mutant proteins show prolonged protein turnover and are associated with increased phosphorylated EGFR upon EGF stimulation. (a) HEK293 cells transfected with plasmids encoding EGFR in combination with HA-Cbl(WT) or HA-Cbl(p.371Y>H) were serum starved for 18 h followed by 15 min EGF (50 ng/ml) stimulation.

Full size image (58 KB) Previous Figures/tables index CBL appears to function as a classic tumor suppressor gene in this cohort	 with germline heterozygosity predisposing to neoplasia upon reduction to homozygosity in target tissues. However	 the predominance of specific missense mutations makes CBL distinct from most tumor suppressor genes such as RB and NF1	 which have more severe loss of function mutations such as deletion or protein truncation. This suggests that the mutant Cbl proteins retain an essential biochemical function20	21	 which is supported by our data showing that exclusive expression of a mutant CBL allele has positive effects on cytokine signaling and proliferation. The specific disruption of E3 ligase activity might leave intact adaptor functions	 resulting in a relative imbalance of Cbl's role in signal transduction. Sanada et al. hypothesized that this might result in inhibitory effects on Cbl-b	 a related family member21. This is similar to what has been reported for p53	 a classic tumor suppressor gene with specific gain-of-function mutations in the context of loss of heterozygosity35	 36. Beyond missense mutations	 truncated Cbl proteins also confer transforming effects by countering the negative action of full-length Cbl on RTK signaling37.  Some individuals can experience spontaneous resolution of JMML but later develop clinical features consistent with vasculitis and other autoimmune phenomena. Mice that lack Cbl in T cells develop severe vascular lesions with massive infiltration of T cells and high concentrations of anti-double stranded DNA antibodies38. These T cells are hypersensitive to T cell receptor signaling and show prolonged ERK phosphorylation. Similarly	 mice that lack Cbl in B cells develop a lupus-like syndrome associated with perivascular infiltration and hyperactivation of B cell receptor signaling39. In mice	 loss of Cbl-b is required for these phenotypes. Oncogenic Cbl proteins might therefore inhibit Cbl-b in vivo	 resulting in a functional loss of both Cbl and Cbl-b	 which in turn contributes to dysregulated lymphocyte signaling and subsequent vasculitis. The redundant roles of Cbl and Cbl-b were explored by Sanada et al.	 who showed that c-Cbl p.371Y>S inhibits wild-type Cbl-b21. Individuals with JMML and homozygous CBL mutations who undergo HSCT are not known to develop vasculitis later in life	 implying that a normal immune system is essential for preventing this late manifestation.  We describe a new syndrome in which affected children display several congenital anomalies that overlap with NF1	 Noonan syndrome and Legius syndrome	 suggesting that the affected proteins converge on the Ras/MAPK pathway. Indeed	 several Ras/MAPK pathway proteins regulate developmental programs in multiple species: for instance	 the Drosophila homologs of each of these genes (CBL (D-cbl)	 PTPN11 (csw)	 NF1 and SPRED) perform crucial functions for growth and patterning40	41	42	 43.  Individuals with germline CBL mutations are at increased risk of developing JMML	 which might follow an aggressive clinical course or resolve without treatment. Some affected individuals develop vasculitis later in life. The CBL mutations found in JMML can arise de novo or can be transmitted through the germline	 and human leukemia samples invariably show loss of the normal CBL allele. Consistent with this tumor suppressor function	 JMML-associated Cbl proteins confer cytokine hypersensitivity in transduced BaF3-EpoR cells in the absence of wild-type Cbl	 have defective E3 ligase activity	 and constitutively activate key Ras effector pathways. The role of aberrant Cbl signaling in vasculitis remains to be determined	 and it will be interesting to investigate whether individuals with germline CBL mutations who have been cured of JMML after HSCT remain at risk of developing vasculitis. It is also of great interest that some of these individuals continue to show homozygous CBL mutations in their peripheral blood despite having improved blood counts. Finally	 our data provide strong evidence that Cbl is a key negative regulator of Ras signaling networks in hematopoietic cells and it will be important to identify key targets of the Cbl ubiquitin ligase to uncover other biochemical mechanisms involved in growth control.

Methods Mainâ€¢ Methodsâ€¢ Accession codesâ€¢ Referencesâ€¢ Acknowledgmentsâ€¢ Author informationâ€¢ Supplementary information Subjects. Subjects were diagnosed and treated either in Europe under the auspices of the European Working Group of Myelodysplastic Syndromes in Childhood (EWOG-MDS) or enrolled as research subjects at the University of California	 San Francisco. The Committees on Human Research at each of the institutions in EWOG-MDS and at UCSF approved these studies. Informed consent was obtained from parents or guardians	 and in the case of pedigree analysis	 all screened relatives. Family and clinical histories were reviewed	 as were physical exams at diagnosis. Additional details are provided in a Supplementary Note.  Mutation screening. Bone marrow or peripheral blood samples at diagnosis were obtained. Mononuclear cells were isolated using standard Histopaque 1111. Buccal swabs	 fibroblasts or tissues unaffected by tumor were also obtained when available. Genomic DNA was extracted using PureGene reagents (Qiagen). Subjects were screened for mutations in CBL	 NRAS	 KRAS and PTPN11 as described6	7	 20.  RNA was prepared according to standard methods. cDNA was generated using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). Splice variants were identified through PCR using an annealing temperature of 58 Â°C and the following primers: 5â€²-TTGAGGGAACACATACTCGCT-3â€² and 5â€²-TATGTTACTGCTGATGGGAACA-3â€². Splice variants were gel extracted using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). The resulting fragments were subcloned using the TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Positive colonies were picked	 mini prepped using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen)	 and sequenced with standard M13 Forward (âˆ’20) and M13 Reverse primers.  Cbl and shRNA expression constructs. For the CFU-GM experiments	 Gateway technology (Invitrogen) was used to clone wild-type and mutant Cbl cDNAs into the murine stem cell virus (MSCV) backbone containing a green fluorescent protein (GFP) cassette driven by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) downstream of the Cbl sequence (pMIG). The human wild-type and 70Z Cbl plasmids were a gift from H. Band (Eppley Cancer Center	 University of Nebraska Medical Center	 Omaha	 Nebraska	 USA)44. For the subsequent experiments using Ba/F3 cells	 the same Cbl cDNAs were cloned into an MSCV-IRES-Venus (pMIV) backbone to allow co-transduction with the GFP-tagged shRNA.  MiR30 based shRNA sequences targeting mouse Cbl were designed by J. Zuber and S. Lowe (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory	 Cold Spring Harbor	 New York	 USA). We selected one of these putative sequences (cbl.2364) and custom ordered a single 110-bp oligonucleotide (Bioneer) to serve as a template for PCR amplification. PCR products were digested with XhoI and EcoRI and ligated into the LTR-driven MiR30 SV40-GFP (LMS) MSCV-based vector (also provided by the Lowe laboratory) to produce the LMS-2364 retrovirus encoding the Cbl shRNA. The sequence for cbl.2364 is TCGAGAAGGTATATTGCTGTTGACAGTGAGCGATACCTATGAAGCGATGTATAATAGTGAAGCCACAGATGTATTATACATCGCTTCATAGGTACTGCCTACTGCCTCGG.  Hematopoietic progenitor assays. All experimental procedures involving mice were reviewed and approved by the UCSF Committee on Animal Research. These assays were performed as described previously using mouse fetal liver cells transduced with MSCV-Cbl-IRES-GFP retroviruses engineered to express wild-type or mutant Cbl proteins. For the human CFU-GM assays	 mononuclear cells from peripheral blood or bone marrow were plated in MethoCult H4230 (StemCell Technologies)	 supplemented with recombinant human GM-CSF (Peprotech) and counted 14 days later	 as described28. For the CFU-GM assays	 GFP-positive cells were sorted using a FACS Aria (BD Biosciences) and then seeded in methylcellulose medium (M3231; StemCell Technologies)45	 supplemented with recombinant mouse GM-CSF (Peprotech). Colonies were counted by indirect microscopy after 8 d.  Cell viability and proliferation assays and protein blots. Mouse pro-B Ba/F3 cells were transduced with MSCV-EpoR-IRES-puro as described46. These cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 with 10% FCS (HyClone)	 penicillin	 streptomycin	 L-glutamine	 10 ng/ml puromycin (Calbiochem) and 10 Î¼g/ml mouse interleukin-3 (IL-3) (Peprotech).  The Ba/F3-EpoR cells were transduced with the LMS-2364 construct or the LMS vector alone. GFP-positive cells were sorted on a FACS Aria (BD Biosciences) and then transduced with the MSCV-Cbl-IRES-Venus retroviruses expressing wild-type or mutant Cbl. Cells positive for both GFP and YFP expression were sorted on the FACS Aria and studied in proliferation and protein blot assays.  For the proliferation assays	 cells were washed 3 times and then cultured for 6 h in cytokine-free medium before being plated in 6-well plates at a density of 500	000 cells per ml at increasing doses of hEPO (R&D Systems). Growth was monitored every other day using a ViCell cell counter (Beckman Coulter).  For protein blot analysis	 cells were washed 3 times and cultured for 6 h in cytokine-free medium before being stimulated for 15 min with increasing doses of hEPO (R&D Systems). Whole-cell lysates were blotted and probed with the following antibodies: anti-phospho-p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) (Thr202/Tyr204	 cat. 9101)	 anti-phospho-AKT (S473	 cat. 4060)	 anti-phospho-S6 (Ser235/236	 cat. 2211) (all from Cell Signaling Technology); anti-phospho-STAT5 (cat. 44-390G) (Invitrogen) and anti-Î±-tubulin (Abnova). ERK1/2 (cat. 9102)	 AKT (cat. 9272)	 S6 (2217)	 and STAT5 (9363) antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology.  HEK cells. HEK293 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Wisent) at 37 Â°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere.  Antibodies. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against HA (12CA5) and Î±-tubulin were obtained from Boehringer Ingelheim and Sigma	 respectively. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against pEGFR	 EGFR and ubiquitin were obtained from Upstate	 Santa Cruz Biotechnology and DAKO Canada	 respectively. EGF ligand was obtained from Sigma. MG132 proteasome inhibitor was obtained from Boston Biochem.  Plasmids. Plasmids encoding HA-CBL(WT	 70Z	 Y371H	 C384R) were subcloned into the pcDNA-DEST4.0 vector using Gateway Cloning technology (Invitrogen) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmid encoding EGFR was generated as described47.  Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described48. Cells were lysed in EBC buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0	 120 mM NaCl and 0.5% NP-40) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with indicated antibodies in the presence of Protein-A agarose beads (Repligen). Bound proteins were washed 5 times with NETN buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0	 120 mM NaCl	 1 mM EDTA and 0.5% NP-40)	 eluted by boiling in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-containing sample buffer	 and resolved by SDS-PAGE (PAGE).  In vitro ubiquitylation assay. In vitro ubiquitylation assay was performed as described49. Despite the discovery of the p.V617F in JAK2	 the molecular pathogenesis of some chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms remains unclear. Although very rare	 different studies have identified CBL (Cas-Br-Murine ecotropic retroviral transforming sequence) mutations in V617FJAK2-negative patients	 mainly located in the RING finger domain. In order to determine the frequency of CBL mutations in these diseases	 we studied different regions of all CBL family genes (CBL	 CBLB and CBLC) in a selected group of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms. We also included V617FJAK2-positive patients to check whether mutations in CBL and JAK2 are mutually exclusive events.  Design and Methods  Using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography	 we screened for mutations in CBL	 CBLB and CBLC in a group of 172 V617FJAK2-negative and 232 V617FJAK2-positive patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms not selected for loss of heterozygosity. The effect on cell proliferation of the mutations detected was analyzed on a 32D(FLT3) cell model.  Results  An initial screening of all coding exons of CBL	 CBLB and CBLC in 44 V617FJAK2-negative samples revealed two new CBL mutations (p.C416W in the RING finger domain and p.A678V in the proline-rich domain). Analyses performed on 128 additional V617FJAK2-negative and 232 V617FJAK2-positive samples detected three CBL changes (p.T402HfsX29	 p.P417R and p.S675C in two cases) in four V617FJAK2-positive patients. None of these mutations was found in 200 control samples. Cell proliferation assays showed that all of the mutations promoted hypersensitivity to interleukin-3 in 32D(FLT3) cells.  Conclusions  Although mutations described to date have been found in the RING finger domain and in the linker region of CBL	 we found a similar frequency of mutations in the proline-rich domain. In addition	 we found CBL mutations in both V617FJAK2-positive (4/232; 1.7%) and negative (2/172; 1.2%) patients and all of them promoted hypersensitivity to interleukin-3.  Keywords: CBL	 MPN	 mutation analysis Go to: Introduction BCR-ABL1-negative chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are a heterogeneous group of clonal hematologic malignancies characterized by abnormal proliferation and survival of one or more myeloid lineage cells. In some cases these diseases evolve to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These hematologic neoplasms include both classic MPN [essential thrombocythemia (ET)	 polycythemia vera (PV) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF)] and atypical MPN (such as chronic eosinophilic leukemia	 chronic neutrophilic leukemia	 hypereosinophilic syndrome	 mast cell disease and myeloid neoplasms with eosinophilia	 among others).1  In the late 1990s some genetic aberrations were described as molecular disease-causing events in these neoplasms	 most of them via fusion genes resulting from reciprocal chromosomal translocations. Such fusions activate tyrosine kinases	 playing a role similar to ABL1 in chronic myeloid leukemia.2	3 However these fusions are very rare and most of them have been reported in one or two cases worldwide.4  This situation changed in 2005 with the description of the p.V617F mutation (valine to phenylalanine in amino acid 617) in JAK2	 found not only in classic MPN but also in a small number of atypical MPN and other myeloid neoplasms.5 Furthermore	 it was found that most of the V617FJAK2-negative cases of PV had other transforming mutations in exon 12 of JAK2. Other gain-of-function mutations have also been described in genes coding for JAK-STAT receptors	 such as MPL or EPOR in familial and sporadic cases of MPN.6â€“10 However	 to date it is not known whether these mutations cause the full phenotype or whether they cooperate with other still uncharacterized mutations. Thus	 there is still a significant proportion of patients in whom the molecular disease-causing event remains to be discovered.  Recently	 the application of single nucleotide polymorphism and comparative genomic hybridization array technologies has led to the identification of new mutations in loss of heterozygosity regions affecting genes such as TET2	11 ASXL1	12 IKZF1	13 RUNX1	14 IDH1 and IDH2	15 EZH2	16 NF1	17 and CBL.18â€“23  CBL (11q23) codes for a protein of the Cbl family of E3-ubiquitin ligases (CBL	 CBLB and CBLC) that acts as a negative regulator of some cell signaling pathways	 by promoting the ubiquitination of several signaling molecules including some tyrosine kinases. CBL proteins share a common structure	 with a highly conserved tyrosine kinase-binding domain in the amino-terminal region that determines substrate specificity. The catalytic E3-ubiquitin ligase activity resides in the RING finger domain	 which is separated from the tyroskine kinase binding domain by a linker region. CBL and CBLB have two other domains that are not well conserved in CBLC: a proline-rich region involved in the recognition of SH3-proteins	 and the carboxy-terminal UBA domain that interacts with ubiquitin molecules allowing dimer formation.24 CBL and CBLB play an important role in cell signaling in the majority of tissues	 while CBLC activity seems to be restricted to epithelial cells.25â€“27  Over the last few years several groups have identified CBL mutations in different hematologic neoplasms	 although most commonly in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)/MPN such as chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.18â€“23	28â€“39 These changes cause the loss of E3-ubiquitin ligase activity	 resulting in deregulation of downstream targets and an increase in cell proliferation rates. To our knowledge	 CBL mutations seem to be mutually exclusive with other mutations frequently found in these diseases such as Ras mutations	 FLT3-ITD or V617FJAK2. In this study we searched for mutations in CBL	 CBLB and CBLC in a group of 172 V617FJAK2-negative and 232 V617FJAK2-positive MPN patients not selected for loss of heterozygosity	 using a denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC) method. Although most of the mutations described previously have been found in the RING finger domain and in the linker region of CBL	 we found novel mutations also in the proline-rich domain	 both in V617FJAK2-positive and -negative patients.  Go to: Design and Methods Samples  Blood samples were collected from 404 different Caucasian MPN patients without the BCR-ABL1 fusion from several hospitals from the north of Spain. Informed consent was obtained from individual patients and the study was approved by the internal Ethics Committee. The first series of patients included 44 with V617FJAK2-negative MPN (4 diagnosed as PV	 15 as ET	 4 as PMF and 21 as atypical MPN). Later	 a second series of 128 V617FJAK2-negative MPN patients (16 PV	 81 ET and 31 PMF) and 232 V617FJAK2-positive MPN patients (69 PV	 149 ET and 14 PMF) were included. The presence/absence of V617FJAK2 mutation was determined in all patients by amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR).40 In addition	 all 404 samples were negative for the presence of MPL p.W515 mutations by dHPLC. Human leukemia cell lines HEL	 M07e	 UKE-1 and SET-2 were also included in the study (Table 1).  Table 1. Table 1. Frequency of CBL mutations found in our series. Initial mutational screening by dHPLC included 20 healthy (no disease) samples used as controls in order to check the frequency of sequence changes observed in our population. For those fragments in which we found sequence variants in patients	 we also included 180 additional control samples in order to rule out that the changes detected were population polymorphisms.  Cell lines  Cell proliferation assays were performed on 32Dcl3 (32D) murine myeloid cells (DSMZ N. ACC411) incubated at 37ÂºC in 5% CO2 and maintained in 90% RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 10 ng/mL murine interleukin-3 (Recombinant Mouse IL3	 Cat #PMC0035	 GibcoÂ®	 Invitrogen Ltd.	 Paisley	 UK).  Plasmids  Plasmids with tagged human open reading frames in pCMV6-AC-GFP vectors were purchased from Origene Technologies (Cat #RG214069 for CBL	 RG206047 for CBLB and RG205130 for CBLC). The tagged human cDNA clone for FLT3 was also purchased from Origene Technologies as pCMV6-Entry vector (Cat #RC211459) and subcloned into pCMV6-AC-RFP vector (Cat #PS100034). These pCMV6-AC vectors carried the NeoR gene. The pCMVâ€“HA ubiquitin vector was a gift from Dr. Francis Grand from Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory (Salisbury	 UK).  Denaturing high performance liquid chromatography analysis  Genomic DNA was obtained from all the samples and amplified with GenomiPhi v2.0 (GE Healthcare	 Piscataway	 NJ	 USA) in order to obtain enough material for mutational screening. All mutations were confirmed using the original unamplified sample and no discrepancies were observed with whole-genome amplified DNA.  We designed primers with Primer341 to amplify all coding exons of the three screened genes (CBL	 CBLB and CBLC) in flanking introns. For each fragment we also designed a mutant primer introducing a nucleotide change in the forward or reverse primer	 depending on the corresponding melting profile	 to create a control mutated fragment to validate each dHPLC assay. Melting profiles for PCR fragments	 solvent gradients and temperature conditions were calculated by Navigatorâ„¢ Software v1.6.2 (Transgenomic Ltd.	 Omaha	 NE	 USA) and validated experimentally. All the analyses were performed on a WAVEÂ® 4500HT System (Transgenomic Ltd.	 Omaha	 NE	 USA) with a DNASepÂ® HT cartridge. Online Supplementary Table S1 contains a list of primers	 the sizes of the amplified fragments and dHPLC conditions.  PCR reactions were performed with AmpliTaqâ„¢ Gold (Applied Biosystems	 Foster City	 CA	 USA) using standard protocols. After cycling	 samples were subjected to several cycles of heating and cooling in order to create heteroduplex molecules to improve mutation detection by dHPLC. For each fragment	 we sequenced two samples of each different elution profile. Results were analyzed with Mutation Surveyor v3.10 (SoftGenetics LLC	 State College	 PA	 USA) and compared to genomic reference sequences (ENSG00000110395 for CBL	 ENSG00000114423 for CBLB and ENSG00000142273 for CBLC).  All coding exons of CBL	 CBLB and CBLC were initially analyzed in a group of 44 V617FJAK2-negative patients (4 PV	 4 PMF	 15 ET and 21 atypical MPN). In light of the results we analyzed the RING finger domain coding exons (exons 8 and 9 from CBL	 exons 9 and 10 from CBLB and exons 7 and 8 from CBLC) in 128 V617FJAK2-negative (16 PV	 31 PMF	 81 ET) and in 232 V617FJAK2-positive MPN (69 PV	 14 PMF	 149 ET)	 as well as in human leukemia cell lines M07e	 HEL	 SET-2 and UKE-1. We also included CBL exon 12 in this extended analysis because we observed a p.A678V change in one sample from the initial series.  CBL exon 8 deletions  Some of the mutations described for CBL are large deletions involving exon 8 (RING finger domain)18	21â€“23	29	30	32	37	42 and the design of our mutation screening assay was not able to detect some of them. We	 therefore	 designed a new PCR assay with primers located in exon 7 and intron 9 (E7Fw: 5â€™-TCCTGATGGAC-GAAATCAGA-3â€™; E9-Rv: 5â€™-CTCACAATGGATTTTGCCAGT-3â€™) which would amplify a normal fragment of 989 bp. With this assay	 any large deletion of exon 8 would be detected as a product of smaller size.  Site-directed mutagenesis  All missense mutations detected for each gene were functionally tested. Mutants p.R420Q (used as the control mutant)	 p.C416W	 p.P417R	 p.T402HfsX29	 p.S675C and p.A678V for CBL; p.R462W for CBLB and p.Q419PfsX81	 p.P435S and p.E392K for CBLC were obtained using the QuikChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies	 La Jolla	 CA	 USA) from the original plasmids.  Transfection  Transfections were performed with Amaxa NucleofectorÂ® Device II technology (Lonza Cologne GmbH	 Basel	 Switzerland) according to standard protocols. Cells of the 32D cell line in exponential growth were first transfected with FLT3 vector and maintained in medium until a second CBL/Ubi transfection. From the first transfection with FLT3 vector	 cells were grown with Geneticin (G-418 sulfate	 Cat #11811 GibcoÂ®	 Invitrogen Ltd.	 Paisley	 UK) to select those clones that had incorporated the vector.  Cell proliferation assays  Proliferation analysis was performed with the CellTiter 96Â® AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS	 Ref #G3580	 Promega Corp	 Madison	 WI	 USA) according to standard protocols	 comparing cells transfected with wild-type CBL (CBL	 CBLB or CBLC in each case) with cells transfected with mutant CBL during 3 or 4 days	 in triplicate. In each case we carried out four different experiments	 also including 32D(FLT3) cells transfected with pCMV6-AC-GFP and mock-transfected 32D(FLT3) cells as controls. In all cases cells were supplemented with 10 ng/mL recombinant human FLT3-ligand (Cat #GF038	 Millipore	 Temecula	 CA	 USA) and with 10 ng/mL murine interleukin-3 (Recombinant Mouse IL3	 Cat #PMC0035	 GibcoÂ®	 Invitrogen Ltd.	 Paisley	 UK). As the positive mutant control we used p.R420Q	 a previously described CBL mutant with an effect on cell proliferation.28  Statistical analysis  Results from MTS proliferation assays were compared using the Studentâ€™s t-test implemented in UNStat (a free tool available at http://www.unav.es/departamento/genetica/unstat).  Go to: Results Mutational screening  In the initial screening of all coding exons of CBL	 CBLB and CBLC in 44 patients with V617FJAK2-negative MPN we detected two missense changes not previously described in CBL (2/44; 4.5%). In this first series we also found three missense changes in CBLC described as single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs35457630	 rs3208856	 rs116023028) in the RING finger domain and proline-rich region. These changes were detected in samples from both patients and controls. No missense changes were detected in CBLB.  CBL changes (p.C416W or g.72251T>G and p.A678V or g.81664C>T) were found in patients diagnosed with atypical MPN	 although the disease in the patient with p.A678V later evolved to CMML because of the development of dysplastic features. Whereas p.C416W affected the RING finger domain	 like other mutations previously reported	 p.A678V was located in exon 12	 which codes for the proline-rich domain of CBL (see Figure 1). For this reason	 we decided to include this exon in the analysis of CBL in an additional group of patients.  Figure 1. Figure 1. (A) CBL mutations described to date in myeloid malignancies. Mutations found in our analysis are colored in red. In contrast to other studies in which mutations were found in the linker region (LR) and the RING finger domain	 we also found two novel changes ... When we analyzed exon 12 of CBL and the RING finger domains of CBL	 CBLB and CBLC in the additional series of samples (128 V617FJAK2-negative and 232 V617FJAK2-positive patients)	 we found three CBL changes in four V617FJAK2-positive patients (4/232	 1.7%). The first one (detected in a patient with ET) was a not previously reported g.71955_71955A deletion in exon 8. This is a frameshift change that truncates the RING finger domain with loss of the proline-rich and UBA carboxy-terminal domains (p.T402HfsX29) (Figure 1). The second change was a substitution g.72253C>G (p.P417R) in exon 9 in a patient diagnosed with PMF	 also affecting the RING finger domain and previously identified in a patient with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.37 Finally	 the third CBL mutation was a not previously reported g.81655C>G substitution (p.S675C) in exon 12 (proline-rich region). Remarkably	 this change was detected in two different V617FJAK2-positive patients	 one with ET and the other with PV. None of the 200 control samples analyzed showed any of these changes. CBL exon 8 deletions were not observed in any case.  We also detected a not previously reported substitution (g.149486C>T	 p.R462W) in the RING finger domain of CBLB in a sample from a V617FJAK2-positive patient with PV (1/232; 0.4%). In CBLC	 we detected one frameshift change (g.15702_15703insC	 p.Q419PfsX81)	 in a patient with V617FJAK2-negative PV	 which has been described as a polymorphism (rs66944506).  None of the cell lines included in these analyses (HEL	 SET-2	 UKE-1 and M07e) showed any CBL	 CBLB or CBLC mutation.  CBL mutations promote hypersensitivity to interleukin-3 in 32D(FLT3) cells  A significantly higher number of cells was observed in 32D(FLT3) cells transfected with CBL mutants than with wild-type CBL (P<0.05	 Figure 2)	 grouping data from four independent cell proliferation assays. In addition	 cells transfected with mutant vectors showed significantly higher proliferation rates in all cases (P<0.05	 Figure 2) and with stronger effects than those observed for the p.R420Q control mutation.

By contrast	 assays for p.R462W in CBLB and for p.Q419PfsX81	 p.E392K and p.P435S in CBLC (Online Supplementary Figure S1) showed no significant differences (P>0.05) in proliferation rates.  Go to: Discussion In the last few years the detection of regions with acquired loss of heterozygosity in some patients	 mainly caused by acquired uniparental disomy	 has allowed the identification of candidate genes that may be mutated in myeloid neoplasms. One of these genes is CBL	 which codes for an E3-ubiquitin ligase protein. Cbl family proteins (CBL	 CBLB and CBLC) play an important role as regulators of several signaling pathways promoting the ubiquitination and degradation of some RTK and CTK	44 many of which are involved in these diseases.4	45	46  The first CBL mutation identified was p.R420Q	 affecting the RING finger domain in a patient with AML.28 Subsequently	 other mutations have been reported with variable frequencies in myeloid neoplasms	 affecting not only the RING finger domain but also the linker region (Figure 1). These events have been observed in 1â€“33% cases of secondary AML	 1â€“7% of MPN and 2â€“33% of MDS/MPN and AML	18â€“23	28â€“39 but their frequencies could be as high as 85â€“90% in patients with loss of heterozygosity in 11q.18â€“20	22	23	33 Some reports have also described that 7% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer have CBL mutations	 so this gene can be mutated in other types of tumor.47 CBLB mutations and CBLC missense polymorphisms affecting the RING finger domain have also been described in myeloid neoplasms but at a lower frequency and with unknown effects.22	23	29  In this study we searched for mutations in CBL	 CBLB and CBLC in a cohort of 404 V617FJAK2-negative and -positive MPN patients not selected for the presence of loss of heterozygosity in 11q. Our results show that CBL is mutated in V617FJAK2-negative MPN at a frequency similar to that previously reported (p.C416W and p.A678V; 1.2%	 2/172	 Table 1).49 Both patients with mutations were initially diagnosed as having atypical MPN (2/21; 9.5%)	 although in one of them the disease evolved to CMML due to the development of dysplastic features. CMML is the disease with the highest frequency of CBL mutations reported to date.18â€“20	22	34 None of these mutations had been previously described and	 notably	 p.A678V was located in the proline-rich domain. In V617JAK2-positive MPN we found two mutations affecting the RING finger domain (p.T402HfsX29 in a patient with ET and p.P417R in a patient with PMF) and a recurrent change in the proline-rich domain (p.S675C in a patient with ET and in another one with PV) of CBL. Although TET2	 ASXL1 and JAK2 mutations have been found concurrently	50 CBL mutations and V617FJAK2 seemed to be mutually exclusive events.13	21	26	51 However	 we have found a similar frequency of CBL mutations in both V617FJAK2-positive and V617FJAK2-negative patients (Table 1)	 suggesting that the prevalence of CBL mutations could increase if V617FJAK2-positive patients were also included in CBL mutational studies. Unfortunately	 we cannot know whether both mutations are in the same or in different clones or whether they are monoallelic or biallelic because of the type of sample available. None of the V617FJAK2-positive cell lines analyzed (HEL	 SET-2 and UKE-1) showed CBL mutations that might help us to elucidate how both events could cooperate to drive the disease.43  In order to determine the effect of all these mutations on cell proliferation	 in vitro functional assays were performed. All CBL mutations induced a hyperproliferative response to interleukin-3 in the 32D(FLT3) model	 similar to that induced by the well-characterized p.R420Q mutation.28	31 This effect was not observed for the mutations detected in CBLB and CBLC. CBL was initially described as a putative tumor suppressor gene because of its negative regulatory function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Most of the mutations reported are located in conserved residues of the linker region and RING finger domain and could impair this regulatory function.44	46	52 RING finger domain mutations p.T402HfsX29	 p.C416W and p.P417R described in this work also affect conserved residues of the protein (Figure 3) with a similar effect on the loss of activity of CBL.  Figure 3. Figure 3. Evolutionary conservation of the CBL regions in which mutations have been detected. Sequence comparison between humans (Homo sapiens) and other mammals (Mus musculus	 Rattus norvegicus	 Pan troglodytes	 Bos taurus	 Macaca mulatta and Equus caballus) in ... Notably	 we found two additional	 novel mutations (one of them recurrent) affecting conserved residues in the pro-line-rich region (p.A678V and p.S675C	 Figure 3) which also promote cell proliferation. In fact	 we found similar frequencies of mutations in RING finger and proline-rich domains. The proline-rich region is essential for the interaction of CBL with the adaptor proteins (such as Grb2 and FRs2Î±) needed to maintain a stable attachment between CBL and its substrate	52 with proteins involved in the endocytosis of target receptors (such as SH3KBP1)46 and with several signaling proteins (such as the Src family).46  As in previous studies	 we observed that mock-transfected cells showed greater growth than cells transfected with wild-type CBL	 but less than cells transfected with mutant CBL. This fact is concordant with the proposal by some authors of a dominant negative effect of CBL mutant forms on endogenous wild-type CBL	 making it unable to perform its negative regulatory function and promoting intracellular signaling and higher cell proliferation rates.18	26	27 However	 in vivo studies have shown that the presence of gain-of-function mutants with a dominant effect over endogenous CBL is not enough to develop a myeloproliferative disease.18	26	27 A possible explanation for this phenomenon could be the activity of wild-type CBL as a positive regulator of cell growth contributing to the activation of pathways such as PI3K	 Ras/MAPK and Src.52	53 Under normal conditions	 the negative regulatory activity of CBL could mask its activity as a positive regulator	 but the lack of E3-ubiquitin ligase activity could reveal its signaling enhancing activity.27 This could be the reason for the non-transforming effect of the p.R462W CBLB mutant in 32D(FLT3) cells. CBLB does not show the positive regulatory effects of CBL52 and perhaps the loss of its E3-ubiquitin ligase activity is not enough to promote cell proliferation. In fact	 although CBLB activity seems to be similar to that of CBL in hematologic cells	 very few cases of myeloid neoplasms with CBLB mutations have been reported.25	29  Finally	 the results obtained in CBLC suggest that missense single nucleotide polymorphisms do not increase cell proliferation in our model. Wild-type CBLC induced higher proliferation rates in 32D(FLT3) cells than wild-type CBL in all assays (Online Supplementary Figure S1) possibly due to the absence of an inhibitory role of CBLC in hematologic cells.25	54	55  In conclusion	 we have identified mutations in the proline-rich region of CBL in patients with MPN and also in V617FJAK2-positive patients. Although the entire CBL coding sequence has been investigated in some studies (by sequencing	 not by dHPLC)	18	19	22	32 most research in recent years has focused only on exons coding for the linker region and RING finger domain20	21	23	28	30	31	33â€“36	38 and in patients without other frequent genetic aberrations	 such as mutations in JAK2.26 Proline-rich domain mutations (p.S675C and p.A678V) confer hypersensitivity to cytokines in the 32D(FLT3) model in a similar way to RING finger domain mutations (p.T402HfsX29	 p.C416W and p.P427R)	 suggesting that they should also be considered in analyses of CBL. Although these events seem to be rare in MPN	 our data highlight the importance of reevaluating the prevalence of CBL mutations in other regions of the gene in myeloid neoplasms. This could be of special interest in MDS/MPN because of the high incidence of CBL mutations in these diseases. In addition	 further functional analyses of these genetic events could help us to understand the cellular functions of CBL and the role of the different protein domains. It is well known that CBL activity is mediated by the activation of different RTK	 so the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (such as anti-FLT3) or other signal transduction inhibitors could also be effective in the treatment of patients with CBL mutations.27	32	56																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							
4	17||Acquired uniparental disomy (aUPD) is a common feature of cancer genomes	 leading to loss of heterozygosity. aUPD is associated not only with loss-of-function mutations of tumour suppressor genes1	 but also with gain-of-function mutations of proto-oncogenes2. Here we show unique gain-of-function mutations of the C-CBL (also known as CBL) tumour suppressor that are tightly associated with aUPD of the 11q arm in myeloid neoplasms showing myeloproliferative features. The C-CBL proto-oncogene	 a cellular homologue of v-Cbl	 encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase and negatively regulates signal transduction of tyrosine kinases3	4	5	 6. Homozygous C-CBL mutations were found in most 11q-aUPD-positive myeloid malignancies. Although the C-CBL mutations were oncogenic in NIH3T3 cells	 c-Cbl was shown to functionally and genetically act as a tumour suppressor. C-CBL mutants did not have E3 ubiquitin ligase activity	 but inhibited that of wild-type C-CBL and CBL-B (also known as CBLB)	 leading to prolonged activation of tyrosine kinases after cytokine stimulation. c-Cbl-/- haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) showed enhanced sensitivity to a variety of cytokines compared to c-Cbl+/+ HSPCs	 and transduction of C-CBL mutants into c-Cbl-/- HSPCs further augmented their sensitivities to a broader spectrum of cytokines	 including stem-cell factor (SCF	 also known as KITLG)	 thrombopoietin (TPO	 also known as THPO)	 IL3 and FLT3 ligand (FLT3LG)	 indicating the presence of a gain-of-function that could not be attributed to a simple loss-of-function. The gain-of-function effects of C-CBL mutants on cytokine sensitivity of HSPCs largely disappeared in a c-Cbl+/+ background or by co-transduction of wild-type C-CBL	 which suggests the pathogenic importance of loss of wild-type C-CBL alleles found in most cases of C-CBL-mutated myeloid neoplasms. Our findings provide a new insight into a role of gain-of-function mutations of a tumour suppressor associated with aUPD in the pathogenesis of some myeloid cancer subsets.  Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are heterogeneous groups of blood cancers originating from haematopoietic precursors. They are characterized by deregulated haematopoiesis showing a high propensity to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)7. Some MDS cases have overlapping clinico-pathological features with myeloproliferative disorders	 and are now classified into myelodysplasia/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN) by the World Health Organization (WHO) classification8. To obtain a comprehensive profile of allelic imbalances in these myeloid neoplasms	 we performed allele-specific copy number analyses of bone marrow samples obtained from 222 patients with MDS	 MDS/MPN	 or other related myeloid neoplasms (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2) using high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays combined with CNAG/AsCNAR software9	 10.  Genomic profiles of MDS and MDS/MPN showed characteristic unbalanced genetic changes	 as reported in previous cytogenetic studies11 (Supplementary Fig. 1a); however	 they were detected more sensitively by SNP array analyses (Supplementary Table 3). aUPD was detected in 70 samples (31.5%) on the basis of the allele-specific copy number analyses	 which substantially exceeded the detection rate obtained using a SNP call-based detection algorithm (20.7%) (Supplementary Figs 2 and 4	 and Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). Long stretches of homozygous SNP calls caused by shared identical-by-descent alleles in parents were empirically predicted and excluded (Supplementary Fig. 3). aUPDs were more common in MDS/MPN than in MDS. They preferentially affected several chromosomal arms (1p	 1q	 4q	 7q	 11p	 11q	 14q	 17p and 21q) in distinct subsets of patients	 and frequently associated with mutated oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes (Supplementary Figs 1b and 5). Among these	 the most common aUPDs were those involving 11q (n = 17)	 which defined a unique subset of myeloid neoplasms that were clinically characterized by frequent diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) with normal karyotypes (13 cases) (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 6). We identified a minimum overlapping aUPD segment of approximately 1.4â€‰megabases (Mb) in 11q	 which contained a mutated C-CBL proto-oncogene (Fig. 1b).

C-CBL is the cellular homologue of the v-Cbl transforming gene of the Cas NS-1 murine leukaemia virus5	 12. It was recently found to be mutated in human AML cases13	14	 15. Together with its close homologue	 CBL-B	 C-CBL is thought to be involved in the negative modulation of tyrosine kinase signalling	 primarily through their E3 ubiquitin ligase activity that is responsible for the downregulation of activated tyrosine kinases3	4	 5. By sequencing all C-CBL exons in all 222 samples	 we found C-CBL mutations in 15 of the 17 cases with 11q-aUPD	 whereas only 3 out of 205 cases without 11q-aUPD had C-CBL mutations	 showing a strong association of C-CBL mutations with 11q-aUPD (P = 1.46â€‰Ã—â€‰10-18) (Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Tables 6 and 7)	 as also indicated in a recent report16. Thus	 C-CBL was thought to be the major	 if not the only	 target of 11q-aUPD in myeloid neoplasms. Two different C-CBL mutations co-existed in three cases (Supplementary Fig. 6b). Somatic origins of the mutations were confirmed in three evaluable cases (Supplementary Fig. 6c).  In most cases	 C-CBL mutations were missense	 involving the evolutionarily conserved amino acids within the linker-RING finger domain that is central to the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity17 (Fig. 1c). Another case with a predominant Cys384Tyr mutation also contained a nonsense mutation (Arg343X) in a minor subclone	 which resulted in a v-Cbl-like truncated protein (Supplementary Fig. 6b). In the remaining two cases	 mutations led to amino acid deletions (Î”369-371 and Î”368-382) involving the highly conserved Î±-helix (Î±L) of the linker domain and the first loop of the RING finger. According to the published crystal structure of C-CBL17	 most of the mutated or deleted amino acids were positioned on the interface for the binding to the E2 enzyme (Fig. 1d)	 making contact with either the tyrosine kinase binding domain (Tyrâ€‰368 and Tyrâ€‰371) or E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (Ileâ€‰383	 Cysâ€‰404 and Pheâ€‰418). Especially	 all seven linker-domain mutations selectively involved just three amino acids (Glnâ€‰367	 Tyrâ€‰368 and Tyrâ€‰371) within the conserved Î±L helix (Fig. 1d). Mutations were clearly homozygous in nine cases	 and the apparently heterozygous chromatograms in the other six cases could also be compatible with homozygous mutations affecting the aUPD-positive tumour clones	 given the presence of substantial normal cell components within these samples. Mutations in the remaining three cases were considered to be heterozygous. About half of the C-CBL-mutated cases carried coexisting mutations of RUNX1 (four cases)	 TP53 (one case)	 FLT3 internal tandem duplication (1 case) or JAK2 (3 cases). NRAS and KRAS mutations were prevalent among CMML (15.1%) but occurred within discrete clusters from C-CBL-mutated cases (Supplementary Tables 2 and 6 and Supplementary Fig. 5). The mutation status of C-CBL did not substantially affect the clinical outcome (Supplementary Fig. 7).  All tested C-CBL mutants induced clear oncogenic phenotypes in NIH3T3 fibroblasts	 as demonstrated by enhanced colony formation in soft agar and tumour generation in nude mice (Supplementary Fig. 8). Transformed NIH3T3 cells showed PI3 kinase-dependent activation of Akt and the transformed phenotype was reverted by treatment with the PI3 kinase inhibitor Ly294002 (Supplementary Fig. 9). When introduced into Lin-â€‰Sca1+â€‰c-Kit+ (LSK) HSPCs	 C-CBL mutants (C-CBL(Gln367Pro) and C-CBL(Tyr371Ser))	 as well as a mouse lymphoma-derived oncogenic mutant (C-CBL(70Z))	 significantly promoted the replating capacity of these progenitors (Fig. 2a). Because c-Cbl negatively modulates tyrosine kinase signalling	 and all C-CBL mutations	 including those previously reported13	14	15	16	 affected the critical domains for its enzymatic activity involved in this modulation	 C-CBL was postulated to have a tumour suppressor function; loss-of-function could be a mechanism for the oncogenicity of these C-CBL mutants3	 5. To assess this possibility and to clarify further the role of C-CBL mutations in the pathogenesis of myeloid neoplasms	 we generated c-Cbl-/- mice and examined their haematological phenotypes (Supplementary Fig. 10).

In agreement with previous reports18	19	20	 c-Cbl-/- mice exhibited splenomegaly and an augmented haematopoietic progenitor pool	 as was evident from the increased colony formation of bone marrow cells in methylcellulose culture and higher numbers of LSK and CD34-negative LSK cells in bone marrow and/or spleen compared to their wild-type littermates (Fig. 2bâ€“d and Supplementary Fig. 11). Furthermore	 when introduced into a BCR-ABL transgenic background21	 the c-Cbl-/- allele accelerated blastic crisis depending on the allele dosage (Fig. 2e	 f). These observations supported the notion that wild-type C-CBL has tumour suppressor functions	 whereas â€˜mutantâ€™ C-CBL acts as an oncogene; C-CBL can therefore be both a proto-oncogene and a tumour suppressor gene.  Mouse LSK HSPCs expressed two Cbl family member proteins: wild-type c-Cbl and Cbl-b (Supplementary Fig. 12)22. When transduced into NIH3T3 cells stably expressing human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)	 both Cbl proteins enhanced ubiquitination of EGFR after EGF stimulation	 which was suppressed by coexpression of the C-CBL mutants (Fig. 3a	 b). In haematopoietic cells	 overexpression of wild-type C-CBL enhanced ligand-induced ubiquitination of a variety of tyrosine kinases	 including c-KIT	 FLT3 and JAK2. In contrast	 C-CBL mutants not only showed compromised enzymatic activity	 but also inhibited the ubiquitinating activities in these haematopoietic cells (Fig. 3c)	 leading to prolonged tyrosine kinase activation after ligand stimulation (Fig. 3d).

Because tyrosine kinase signalling is central to cytokine responses in haematopoietic cells and its deregulation is a common feature of myeloproliferative disorders23	 we next examined the effects of C-CBL mutations (C-CBL(Gln367Pro) and C-CBL(Tyr371Ser)) and the loss of wild-type C-CBL alleles on the responses of LSK HSPCs to various cytokines. In serum-free conditions	 c-Cbl-/- LSK cells showed a modestly enhanced proliferative response to a variety of cytokines	 including SCF	 IL3 and TPO	 compared to c-Cbl+/+ cells (mock columns in Fig. 4a). However	 the enhanced response in c-Cbl-/- cells was markedly augmented and extended to a broader spectrum of cytokines	 including FLT3 ligand by the transduction of C-CBL mutants. Of note	 the effect of C-CBL mutant transduction was not remarkable in c-Cbl+/+ LSK cells except for the response to SCF	 which was clearly enhanced by C-CBL mutants even with a c-Cbl+/+ background (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 13). To clarify further the effect of wild-type C-CBL on C-CBL mutants	 both wild-type C-CBL and C-CBL mutants were co-transduced into c-Cbl-/- LSK cells	 and their effects on the response to SCF were examined. As shown in Fig. 4b	 the hyperproliferative response induced by C-CBL mutants was almost completely abolished by the co-transduction of wild-type C-CBL	 suggesting the pathogenic importance of loss of wild-type C-CBL alleles found in most C-CBL-mutated cases. LSK cells transduced with C-CBL mutants also showed enhanced activation of the STAT5 and Akt pathways on cytokine stimulation (SCF and TPO)	 which was more pronounced in c-Cbl-/- than c-Cbl+/+ LSK cells (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 14).

The modest enhancement of sensitivity to cytokines found in c-Cbl-/- LSK cells was a consequence of loss of C-CBL functions. In contrast	 the hypersensitive response of mutant-transduced c-Cbl-/- LSK cells to a broad spectrum of cytokines represents gain-of-function of the mutants that could not be ascribed to a simple loss of C-CBL functions	 which was also predicted from the strong association of C-CBL mutations with 11q-aUPD by analogy to the gain-of-function JAK2 mutations associated with 9p-aUPD in polycythemia vera2. The gain-of-function of C-CBL mutants became more evident under a c-Cbl-/- background. The hypersensitive response to cytokines induced by mutant C-CBL under the c-Cbl-/- background was largely offset by the presence of the wild-type c-Cbl allele or by the transduction of the wild-type C-CBL gene	 suggesting that the gain-of-function could be closely related to loss of C-CBL-like functions	 probably by inhibition of Cbl-b. Supporting this view is a previous report that c-Cbl/Cbl-b double knockout Tâ€‰cells showed more profound impairments in the downregulation of the T-cell receptor (TCR)	 more sustained TCR signalling	 and more vigorous proliferation	 than c-Cbl or Cbl-b single knockout Tâ€‰cells after anti-CD3 (also known as CD3e) stimulation24. This is analogous to the gain-of-function found in some TP53 mutants	 which has been explained by functional inhibition of two TP53 homologues	 TP73 and TP63 (refs 25	 26). Of note	 TP53 was also originally isolated as an oncogene through its mutated forms27. The Cbl-b inhibition-based gain-of-function model could be tested directly by comparing the behaviour of c-Cbl/Cbl-b double knockout LSK cells with that of LSK cells carrying homozygously knocked-in mutant C-CBL alleles. On the other hand	 there remains a possibility that the gain-of-function could be mediated by a mechanism other than the simple inhibition of the homologue	 because C-CBL mutants retained several motifs that interacted with numerous signal-transducing molecules. Furthermore	 considering the ubiquitous expression of CBL proteins	 it would be of interest to explore the possible involvement of mutations in all CBL family members in other human cancers.   																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
5	18||Oncogenic mutations in the monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) gene have been found in many tumors	 but their significance remains largely unknown. Several human c-Cbl (CBL) structures have recently been solved depicting the protein at different stages of its activation cycle and thus provide mechanistic insight underlying how stability-activity tradeoffs in cancer-related proteins may influence disease onset and progression. In this study	 we computationally modeled the effects of missense cancer mutations on structures representing four stages of the CBL activation cycle to identify driver mutations that affect CBL stability	 binding	 and activity. We found that recurrent	 homozygous	 and leukemia-specific mutations had greater destabilizing effects on CBL states than did random non-cancer mutations. We further tested the ability of these computational models assessing the changes in CBL stability and its binding to ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2	 by performing blind CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays in cells. Experimental CBL ubiquitin ligase activity was in agreement with the predicted changes in CBL stability and	 to a lesser extent	 with CBL-E2 binding affinity. Two-thirds of all experimentally tested mutations affected the ubiquitin ligase activity by either destabilizing CBL or disrupting CBL-E2 binding	 whereas about one-third of tested mutations were found to be neutral. Collectively	 our findings demonstrate that computational methods incorporating multiple protein conformations and stability and binding affinity evaluations can successfully predict the functional consequences of cancer mutations on protein activity	 and provide a proof of concept for mutations in CBL.  Keywords: CBL	 driver mutations	 protein interactions Go to: Introduction Whole exome sequencing of cancer patients has produced unprecedented amounts of data to analyze and interpret; these studies report a very large fraction of missense mutations which can potentially be implicated in tumorigenensis (1). Although some missense mutations can provide selective growth advantage to tumor cells (driver mutations)	 the large majority of them are considered to be neutral (passenger mutations). The mechanisms by which the driver variants may affect protein stability	 interactions	 and function remain largely unknown. Various computational methods have been developed to estimate the impacts of disease mutations on proteins but most of them exclusively use sequence features and do not explicitly utilize the protein three-dimensional structures	 their physico-chemical properties and dynamics (2	 3). Many cancers are characterized by (de)activation of certain proteins which may be a result of missense mutations (4). The interconversion between active and inactive states is highly regulated in proteins and it is not well understood how these regulatory mechanisms are disrupted in cancer. The development of in silico approaches to estimate the effects of disease mutations on protein activity	 stability and binding will help to define which are likely to be driver or passenger mutations. Moreover	 understanding the mechanisms of their actions would allow for prioritization of potential driver candidates for better targeted therapies to design drugs which might in turn compensate for the reduced/enhanced protein stability or activity.  The monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) RING finger ubiquitin ligase (E3) represents an exceptionally difficult yet important system to study the mechanisms of cancer mutations (5	 6). Strikingly	 proteins from this family play both positive and negative regulatory roles in tyrosine kinase signaling which is aberrantly activated in many cancers (5). Oncogenic mutations in the c-Cbl gene (referred to as CBL thereafter) were found in human myeloid neoplasms and other tumors (5) but the significance of these mutations and their impacts on CBL function were studied only for very few mutants (7). The mechanistic aspects of CBL cancer mutations can now be adequately addressed as several CBL structures have become available which represent the snapshots of different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1). All CBL proteins share a highly conserved N-terminus which includes a tyrosine kinaseâ€“binding domain (TKBD)	 a linker helix region (LHR) and a RING finger domain	 while the C-terminus comprises a proline-rich region (8). The RING domain of CBL has E3 activity and ubiquitinates activated receptor tyrosine kinases which subsequently targets them for degradation (8). At the same time	 since CBL proteins can bind to activated receptor tyrosine kinases via the TKBD domain	 they can serve as adaptors by recruiting downstream signal transduction components such as SHP2 and P13K (9	 10).  Figure 1 Figure 1 CBL activation cycle. The structures representing the activation cycle of CBL are shown. In the inactive closed state (nCBL) the protein exists in the cytosol. Upon activation of the RTK	 CBL can bind to the phosphorylated RTK (orange peptide) via TKBD ... Another aspect of CBL function which should be accounted for in modeling the effects of cancer mutations is that it can bind to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) in complex with ubiquitin (Ub) and a substrate protein	 thereby facilitating the transfer of Ub from E2 to a lysine residue of the substrate (11). The crystal structure of the inactive complex of CBL with E2 (UbcH7) was solved more than ten years ago (12) while the active phosphorylated CBL-E2 (UbcH5B) complex was resolved fairly recently (13). According to the latter study	 substrate binding and Tyr371 phosphorylation activates CBL by producing a large conformational change in order to place the RING domain and E2 in close proximity to the substrate. It was further confirmed that phosphorylation-induced conformational change is required for positioning of ubiquitin for effective catalysis (14).  Here we present a new approach	 which aims to assess the effects of cancer mutations on stability	 binding and activity of cancer related proteins. We apply computational models to four different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1) and perform blind in vivo experiments of CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination. We show a rather remarkable agreement of experimental EGFR ubiquitination by CBL mutants with the computed changes in CBL thermodynamic stability and to a lesser extent with CBL-E2 binding affinity. The computational models not only quantitatively predict the magnitude of the effects of mutations but also shed light on the mechanisms of their action. Namely	 we find that cancer mutations have greater destabilizing effects on four CBL states than random non-cancer mutations for recurrent	 homozygous and leukemia mutations. Most damaging cancer mutations happen in the sites involved in Zn-coordination and in the formation of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds within CBL or between CBL and E2. Overall cancer driver mutations affect different or multiple stages of the CBL activation cycle either completely abolishing its E3 activity or partially attenuating it. The computational models based on stability and binding affinity calculations can discriminate experimentally validated driver from passenger mutations (with the exception of two mutations) and outperform several state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods aiming to predict phenotypic impacts of mutations.  Go to: Materials and Methods Computational modeling and analysis  Mapping of CBL mutations The COSMIC database (15) stores data on somatic cancer mutations and integrates the experimental data from full-genome sequencing studies. We extracted 103 missense mutations for the CBL gene from the COSMIC database (15) that could be mapped to four available CBL structures in its activation cycle (Fig. 1). Cancer mutations were classified into different classes according to the frequency of observed samples (single and recurrent mutations)	 zygosity (homo- and heterozygous mutations)	 types of cancer (leukemia and sarcoma) and the involvement of mutations in Zn-coordination (Table S1). In addition	 all possible single nucleotide substitutions resulting in amino-acid changes in the CBL gene were performed to obtain a â€œRandomâ€ missense mutation reference set. After excluding mutations observed in COSMIC and mutations occurring on residues without known coordinates in crystal structures	 we obtained 2	102 random missense mutations (Table S1). We also searched the dbSNP database (16) but found very few benign variations in the CBL gene. Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.  Model preparation We investigated the effects of mutations on four states of the CBL activation cycle: (1) closed CBL state (nCBL)	 (2) partially opened CBL state bound to substrate (CBL-S)	 (3) unphosphorylated autoinhibitory CBL bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and (4) phosphorylated CBL bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1). It was previously noted that both UbcH5B and UbcH7 can bind specifically to CBL but only UbcH5B can facilitate ubiquitination (17). The crystal structures of nCBL (PDB id: 2Y1M) (13)	 CBL-S (PDB id: 2Y1N) (13) and pCBL-E2-S (PDB id: 4A4C) (13) were obtained directly from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (18). Only one crystal structure of the unphosphorylated inactive state of CBL bound to E2 (UbcH7) and Zap-70 peptide (PDB id: 1FBV) (12) was available in PDB. Although sequence identity between UbcH7 and UbcH5B proteins is 38%	 the structural similarity is very high with the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.04 Ã…. The unphosphorylated autoinhibitory structure of CBL-UbcH5B-S was therefore modeled based on CBL-UbcH7-S (PDB id: 1FBV) using Chimera (19). (Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.)  Minimization procedure We applied our recently developed optimization protocol for minimizing wild-type and mutant structures (20). Heavy side chain atoms without known coordinates and hydrogen atoms were added to the crystal structures using the VMD (version 1.9.1) program (21) with models immersed into rectangular boxes of water molecules extending up to 10 Ã… from the protein in each direction. Wild-type protein complexes were minimized for 40	000 steps using explicit TIP3P water model. The final minimized models of wild-type protein complexes were used to produce all mutant structures and then an additional 300-step minimization for all mutant structures was performed. The energy minimization was carried out with the NAMD program (version 2.9) (22) using the CHARMM27 force field (23). For unfolding free energy calculations we applied the optimization procedure implemented in the RepairPDB module of the FoldX program (24) which optimizes the side chain configurations to provide a repaired structure. (See Supplementary Materials and Methods for more information.)  Binding and unfolding free energy calculations Binding free energy and effects of mutations on binding affinity were calculated according to the approach introduced by us earlier (20). Energy calculations were based on the modified MM-PBSA method that combined the molecular mechanics terms with the Poissonâ€“Boltzmann continuum representation of the solvent (25) and statistical scoring energy functions with parameters optimized on experimental sets of several thousand mutations (equation 3). Binding free energy calculations were performed on minimized wild-type and mutant structures of inactive CBL-E2-S and active pCBL-E2-S states. The binding energy is defined as a difference between the free energies of the complex and unbound proteins.  Î”Gbind=GCBL-E2-S-GCBL-S-GE2 (1) The change of binding energy due to a mutation can be calculated as:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î”Gbindmut-Î”GbindWT (2) The effect of mutations on binding affinity was calculated in this work using the following energy function:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î±Î”Î”Evdw+Î²Î”Î”Gsolv+Î³Î”SAmut+ÎµÎ”Î”GBM+Î»Î”Î”GFD+Î´ (3) Here Î”Î”Evdw is the change of the van der Waals interaction energy and Î”Î”Gsolv is the change of the polar solvation energy of solute in water. Î”SAmut represents a term proportional to the interface area of the mutant complex. Î”Î”GBM and Î”Î”GFD are the binding energy changes from BeAtMuSiC and FoldX	 respectively. BeAtMuSiC (26) estimates the effect of mutations on binding based on statistical potentials.  The FoldX software program (24) was used to estimate the unfolding free energy and to model the unfolding state. FoldX calculates the effects of mutations on protein stability using an empirical force field. The BuildModel module was used to introduce a mutation	 optimize the configurations of the neighboring side chains and calculate the difference in stability (unfolding free energy) between mutant ( Î”Gfoldmut) and repaired native structure ( Î”GfoldWT).  Î”Î”Gfold=Î”Gfoldmut-Î”GfoldWT (4) For comparison we used three alternative methods to predict the impacts of mutations on unfolding free energy: the Eris server (27)	 the Rosetta program (28) and the PoPMuSiC server (29). We also applied four additional webtools to assess the impacts of amino acid substitutions on CBL function: PROVEAN (30)	 PolyPhen-2 (31)	 MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). (See Supplementary Methods for more information.)  Go to: Experimental procedures Expression constructs  Human CBL cDNA was originally obtained from Wallace Langdon and subsequently cloned into the pCEFL expression plasmid (34). Point mutation constructs	 described above	 were created from wild-type CBL using the QuikChange II Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions (Stratagene	 La Jolla	 CA). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.  Cell culture and transfections  The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T	 the human nonsmall cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the human cervical cancer cell line HeLa used in this study were originally obtained from ATCC and maintained in culture using DMEM (Gibco	 Grand Island	 NY) supplemented with 10% FBS	 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin sulfate. Cell lines were authenticated by Short Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis by using either Promega Powerplex 16 (Promega	 Madison	 WI) or the AmpFISTR Identifier Kit (Life Technologies	 Carlsbad	 CA) and compared to the ATCC or DSMZ databases. HeLa cells were received in the lab in 2013 last authenticated on 7-30-15	 A549 were received in the lab in 2015 and last authenticated on 8-12-15	 and HEK293T were received in the lab in 1995 and last authenticated on 10-8-15.HEK293T cells were transfected using calcium phosphate according to the instructions accompanying the reagent (Profection; Promega Corp.	 Madison	 WI)	 incubated 18 h prior to media change and grown for a total of 48 h prior to harvesting. A549 and Hela cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen	 Carlsbad	 CA). Transfections were allowed to incubate 6 h prior to media change	 and cells were grown an additional 48 h before being harvested. Cells were starved for 4 hours and treated with EGF (100 ng/ul). Each cell-based experiment was repeated at least two times.  Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation  To harvest proteins	 cells were washed twice in ice-cold Dulbeccoâ€™s PBS-containing 200 Î¼M sodium orthovanadate (Fisher Chemicals	 Fairlawn	 NJ) then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5	 150 mM NaCl	 5 mM EDTA	 1% Triton X-100	 10% glycerol	 100 mM iodoacetamide [Sigma-Aldrich Corp.	 St. Louis	 MO]	 2 mM sodium orthovanadate	 and protease inhibitors [Complete tabsÂ®	 Roche Diagnostics Corp.	 Indianapolis	 IN]). All whole cell lysates were cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 16	000 Ã— g for 15 m at 4 Â°C. Supernatant protein concentrations were determined using the BioRad protein assay (BioRad	 Hercules	 CA). For immunoblotting	 20Î¼g of whole cell lysates were boiled in a 1:1 dilution of 2X loading buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8	 10% glycerol	 2% SDS	 1 mg/ml bromophenol blue	 0.3573 M Î²-mercaptoethanol) for 5 m. For immunoprecipitations	 150 Î¼g of each of the whole cell lysates were incubated with rabbit anti-EGFR (Ab-3; Millipore) and with Protein A/G+ agarose beads (sc-2003; Santa Cruz Biotechnology	 Santa Cruz	 CA). All immunoprecipitations were incubated overnight at 4Â°C with tumbling. Immune complexes were washed five times in 1 mL cold lysis buffer	 then resuspended in 2X loading buffer	 boiled for 5 m	 then resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran BA85; Whatman	 Sanford	 MA). For immunoblot detection of proteins	 the following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-EGFR (2232L; Cell Signaling)	 rat monoclonal high affinity anti-HA-peroxidase	 (clone 3F10; Roche)	 rabbit anti-Cbl (sc-C-15; Santa Cruz) and mouse anti-Hsc70 (sc-7298; Santa Cruz). Horseradish peroxidase linked donkey anti-rabbit IgG (NA934V; GE Healthcare	 Piscataway	 NJ)	 or donkey anti-mouse IgG (NA931: GE Healthcare	 Piscataway	 NJ) immunoglobulin was used with SuperSignal (Pierce Biotechnology Inc.	 Rockford	 IL) to visualize protein detection.  Densitometric Analysis  Immunoblots were developed on HyBlot CL Autoradiography Film (Denville Scientific Inc.	 South Plainfield	 NJ) with an X-OMAT automated processor (Eastman Kodak	 Rochester	 NY). Protein expression levels were then recorded using an Epson Perfection V750 PRO scanner (Epson Inc.	 Long Beach	 CA) and densitometric analysis was performed using Adobe Photoshop software version 7.0 (Adobe Systems Inc.	 U.S.A). EGFR ubiquitination signal intensity was determined by optical density in a set area normalized against the EGFR band intensity in parallel immunoblots and expressed as a densitometric ratio of ubiquitination/EGFR levels. The mean densitometric ratio of EGFR ubiquitination	 in the presence of each CBL mutation	 was then assessed relative to wild-type CBL where the ratio was set at 1.0.  Go to: Results Cancer mutations impact CBL stability  We estimated the thermodynamic stability (unfolding free energy) changes	 Î”Î”Gfold	 upon mutation for closed (nCBL) and partially opened (CBL-S) CBL states (Fig. 1). These states did not involve binding to E2. The examination of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for random non-cancer mutations (Fig. 2A) showed that it was very similar to experimental distributions produced by random mutagenesis on a set of different proteins (35	 36). Namely	 the distribution for random non-cancer mutations was asymmetrically centered at positive energy values and there were about 10% of random mutations with highly damaging effects on CBL structures by more than 5 kcal molâˆ’1 (Fig. 2A). Despite the presence of highly damaging random mutations	 recurrent cancer mutations overall produced significantly larger destabilizing effects compared to random (p-value â‰ª 0.01) for both nCBL and CBL-S states (Fig. 2A and S1	 Table S2). This was not the case for single cancer mutations observed in only one patient (Table S2). Overall	 the form of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for recurrent cancer mutations was different from the Î”Î”Gfold distribution of random mutations (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p-value â‰ª 0.01) whereas the distribution for single cancer mutations was indistinguishable from a random mutation distribution. However	 it does not mean that all single cancer mutants can be considered passenger	 as we show later	 this is not the case for some of them.  Figure 2 Figure 2 (A) The distribution of unfolding (Î”Î”Gfold) and binding (Î”Î”Gbind) free energy changes for Single	 Recurrent and Random class mutations on nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states (see SI for other states). Positive and negative values ... The top 25% cancer mutations with the largest damaging effects are presented in Table S3. Many of them occurred in Zn-coordinating sites while many others did not involve Zn-coordination sites. Some of these latter mutations (G415V	 G413R and G415S) introduced large Van der Waals clashes with neighboring residues which could not be accommodated by side chain rearrangements	 whereas other mutations (S376F	 Y371D and L405P) affected disulfide or hydrogen bonds. For example	 L405P located in the middle of an Î±-helix affected the CBL structure by introducing an energetically unfavorable kink in the helix due to its inability to donate an amide hydrogen bond.  Effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding  The outcome of mutations can be assessed by the extent of structural changes they induce. We calculated the local root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between the minimized wild-type and mutant structures around the mutated site. We found that the protein backbone in the vicinity of a mutation of the CBL-E2 complex underwent larger local conformational changes upon recurrent cancer mutations	 especially for mutations occurring in Zn-coordinating site clusters	 compared to random mutations (p-value â‰ª 0.01	 Fig. S2 and S3). In the previous section we analyzed the original closed (nCBL) state and partially opened (CBL-S) state induced by substrate binding. In this section we study the effects of cancer mutations on two other CBL states: an autoinhibitory CBL state bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and phosphorylated active CBL state bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1) (13). Effects of mutations on binding can be in general linked with their structural locations	 therefore we examined the locations of mutations and found that about one third of all cancer mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface (Fig. S4). This preference was found to be statistically significant (p-value â‰ª 0.01) (Fig. S4).  It was previously experimentally shown that binding between CBL and E2 was rather weak with a micromolar dissociation constant (13). Despite the fact that the interface between CBL and E2 in the inactive state is several residues larger than in the active state	 consistent with experiments	 we found somewhat stronger binding between CBL and E2 for the active state of CBL (Table S4). Similarly to the impacts of cancer mutations on stability	 recurrent (but not single) mutations destabilized CBL-E2 binding significantly (Fig. 2B	 S1 and Table S2). Importantly	 cancer mutations reduced the CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state (p-value = 0.002) (Fig. 2B) and the effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding of the active state were noticeably larger compared to random mutations even if we excluded mutations in Zn-coordinating sites (Table S2). This latter observation does not hold true for the autoinhibitory CBL-E2-S conformation.  Next	 all cancer mutations were ranked with respect to their effects on CBL-E2 binding. About half of all highly damaging mutations (top 25% of most damaging mutations	 Table S3) impacted both stability and CBL-E2 binding for all four CBL states. Among them	 several mutations occurred in Zn-coordinating clusters and M400 and L405 sites. Another class of mutations (involving W408 and R420 sites) mostly influenced CBL-E2 binding. For example	 the W408S mutation caused the largest perturbation in CBL-E2 binding of the active state by decreasing binding affinity up to 3.5 kcal molâˆ’1 but having a moderate effect on stability of the nCBL and CBL-S states. It was previously suggested that amino acids in positions W408 and I383 constituted specificity of CBL-E2 binding and corresponded to binding hot spots (10	 12). Mutations in the I383 site are not recorded in the COSMIC database although they have a profound destabilizing effect on CBL-E2 binding for both states (see data for random mutations on the ftp site ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/panch/CBL). Another site affecting binding of CBL (R420) is a highly conserved site in the CBL family	 it strongly interacts with the Q92	 W93 and S94 residues of E2. It was previously experimentally verified that mutations in this site disrupted the CBL activity and could be associated with cytokine-independent growth (37). There are 24 cancer patient samples where mutations of this site (R420Q	 R420L and R420P) are found and they all produce strong destabilizing effects on the active pCBL-E2-S state.  According to the zygosity annotation	 there are 49 heterozygous (â€œHeteroâ€) and 27 homozygous (â€œHomoâ€) mutations (Table S1) and for the rest of cancer mutations their zygocity status is undetermined. Overall	 we found that destabilizing mutations were enriched among homozygous compared to heterozygous mutations for all stages of CBL activation cycle (p-value = 0.021 â€“ 0.035) and were more prevalent in leukemia compared to sarcoma patients (p-value = 0.000 â€“ 0.003) (Fig. 2B	 Table S2). This observation could not be attributed to the prevalence of homozygous mutations in Zn-coordinating clusters since these clusters had almost equal numbers of heterozygous and homozygous mutations. It was reported earlier that many homozygous mutations could be connected to uniparental disomy when germline heterozygosity would lead to neoplasia upon reduction to homozygosity (6	38	 39). If some patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms had germline heterozygous mutations in CBL	 then lost the wild-type CBL allele and duplicated mutant allele	 it would be possible that the damaging mutant allele would be duplicated in a cancer cell with a higher probability. Indeed	 human leukemia samples show the loss of the normal CBL allele.  CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination: comparing experiments with computational models  Next we randomly picked fifteen cancer mutations based on their predicted damaging status	 trying to equally sample highly damaging and benign mutations irrespective to their frequencies in cancer samples	 and experimentally tested the E3 activity of wild-type and mutant CBL proteins (see Methods	 Table 1). As can be seen in Fig. 3A	 in the presence of wild-type CBL	 activation of the EGFR induced more than a 10-fold increase in the ubiquitination of the EGFR compared to empty vector (endogenous CBL levels) in HEK293T cells (compare lane 4 to lane 2 in top panel of Fig. 3A). The E3 activity of wild-type CBL was mirrored by a decrease in the levels of immunoprecipitated EGFR consistent with the targeting of ubiquitinated EGFR for degradation (compare lanes 2 and 4 in second panel of Fig. 3A).  Figure 3 Figure 3 (A) EGFR ubiquitination. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant CBL proteins along with the EGFR and hemagglutinin (HA)-epitope tagged ubiquitin. The vector control and wild-type	 CBL transfectant cells were incubated ... Table 1 Table 1 Experimental relative densitometry values for HEK293T cells	 predicted changes in stability (Î”Î”Gfold kcal molâˆ’1)	 binding affinity (Î”Î”Gbind kcal molâˆ’1) and comparison with other methods for 15 experimentally ... We classified all mutations into three groups (damaging	 attenuating and benign) according to their experimental relative densitometry data and compared experimental data with the estimates produced by the computational models. The first group of damaging mutants included C396R	 H398Q	 Y371H	 K382E and C381A which completely abolished CBL activity (relative densitometry was less than 10%) (Fig. 3B) and the levels of total EGFR were not decreased by these mutants (Fig. 3A). Only two of these mutants belonged to the Recurrent class of mutations. Table 1 shows predicted and experimentally verified effects of mutations on all four CBL states. All five mutants were predicted to be damaging by stability and binding affinity calculations but the mechanisms of their action were different. C396R	 H398Q and C381A mutations disrupted Zn-coordinating clusters and had very damaging consequences according to the stability model for both nCBL and CBL-S states and damaging effects on CBL-E2 binding even though none of these mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface. On the other hand	 the K382E mutation did not affect Zn-coordination but destabilized the nCBL state. This	 in turn	 could be explained by the charge substitution that led to the disruption of the K382-E373 salt bridge within the closed state of nCBL (Figure 4 and Figure S5A). Moreover	 K382E mutation had a significant impact on CBL-E2 binding due to the disruption of a salt bridge between pY371 and K382 affecting the stability of CBL in the active state (Figure 4 and Figure S5D). No significant changes were observed for CBL-S and CBL-E2-S states (Figure S5B	C). K382E mutation was previously observed in Noonan syndrome and was speculated to affect CBL stability or binding (40). Finally	 the Y371H mutation not only abolished phosphorylation at the Y371 site but also had a profound destabilizing effect on all four states as evident from Table 1.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Structures of wild type (green) and K382E mutant (tan) are shown for nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states. Salt bridges are shown as dashed lines and in both cases mutation affects the stability by disrupting the salt bridge. The second group of mutants (M374V	 V430M	 P428L	 Q249E and double mutant S80N/H94Y) maintained the CBL activity equivalent to or greater than wild-type CBL (relative densitometry of 80% or higher) (Fig. 3B). Consistent with this	 the levels of the activated EGFR were also decreased in these samples (Fig. 3A). To confirm that the retained E3 activity of these mutants was not cell type specific	 we transfected these mutants into the non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the cervical cancer cell line Hela (Fig. S6). The S80N/H94Y and Q249E mutations were previously identified in human non-small cell lung cancers making the A549 cell line a relevant cell type to investigate the function of these CBL mutants while other cancer mutations were found in other cancer types. As in the HEK293T cells	 transfection of wild-type CBL into A549 and HeLa cells resulted in a significant increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of EGFR compared to the cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. S6). The increase in transfected CBL protein compared to endogenous CBL protein was less in HeLa than in either the A549 or HEK293T cells. Consistent with this	 the fold increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of the EGFR by wild-type CBL was smaller in Hela cells (about three fold) compared to either A549 or HEK293T cells (more than 10 fold in each). As in HEK293T cells	 the Y371H mutant did not stimulate ubiquitination compared to the vector transfected control for A549 or HeLa cells (Fig. S6A and C). The CBL mutants that were fully active in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3A and B) maintained CBL E3 activity in A549 and HeLa cells (Fig. S6). Two of these CBL mutants resulted in more ubiquitination of EGFR compared to wild type CBL. For example	 the Q249E mutant showed an increased ubiquitination of EGFR in 293T and HeLa cells while the M374V mutant resulted in higher ubiquitination levels in A549 and HeLa cells (Figure 3 and S6). Only V430M mutant was on the borderline with the densitometry ratio of 0.8. All mutations from the second group were predicted to be benign according to our computational models	 whereas V430M	 consistent with experimental data	 had a borderline destabilizing impact on CBL-E2 binding (Table 1).  Finally	 the third group constituted mutations (L399V	 G375P	 P395A and V391I) which attenuated the CBL E3 activity according to the relative densitometry data (Fig. 3B). Only one of these mutants was observed in two cancer samples while other three belonged to the Single mutation class. Concordant with this	 there were intermediate levels of EGFR (Fig. 3A). G375P and P395A mutations were predicted to have partially damaging effects while V391I and L399V were classified as benign in our predictions. Interestingly	 mutations from this third group affected only some of the CBL states. In contrast	 the highly damaging mutations from the first group had damaging impacts on almost all CBL states.  Next we tested if the reduction in CBL ubiquitination activity was directly correlated with the effects of mutations on stability (Fig. 5A). The relationship between experimental densitometry data and Î”Î”Gfold was better described by an exponential dependence with correlation coefficient (R) of 0.77 and 0.78 for CBL-S and nCBL states respectively (Table S5). Indeed	 the change in absorption between wild-type and mutant proteins which refers to a fraction of active mutants can be described by the Boltzmann equation relating the probability of a state with the energy of this state. A mutation may lead to damaging effects and a loss of function if it impacts at least one of the CBL functional states. Taking this into consideration we calculated the correlation between densitometry and stability changes taking a maximum of Î”Î”Gfold values for the nCBL and CBL-S states. As shown in Fig. 5A and Table S5	 changes in stability can indeed explain the effects of mutations on CBL ubiquitination activity with high correlation of R = 0.83. For comparison	 several alternative methods were applied to predict the effect of mutations on unfolding free energy	 they all reported correlation coefficients ranging from 0.21 to 0.52	 with only one method PopMusic reporting a statistically significant correlation of 0.52 (Table S5). The relationship between densitometry and binding affinity changes was on the borderline of significance with a linear correlation coefficient of 0.48 and 0.62 (if two highly damaging mutations were excluded) (Fig. 5B and Table S5).  Figure 5 Figure 5 (A) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (exponential model) and maximal predicted changes in stability. (B) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (linear model) and predicted changes in binding affinity of pCBL-E2-S state. ... There are various methods which predict the phenotypic effects of mutations	 (30â€“33	 41) and some of them use structural features (31	 41). We applied four state-of-the-art independent methods to predict the impacts of mutations on CBL function: PROVEAN (30)	 PolyPhen-2 (31)	 MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). Some of these methods outperformed our model in classifying cancer from random mutations since they were trained to distinguish disease from neutral variants (Table S6). However	 all four methods had a very limited accuracy in classifying CBL cancer mutations into those that disrupted function and those that did not. As evident from Table 1 and Table S5	 all methods except for PROVEAN over-predicted damaging effects of experimentally tested mutations while PROVEAN was the only method which produced a significant correlation between the densitometry data and PROVEANâ€™s score (R=0.58	 Table S5).  Go to: Discussion Stability-activity balance in cancer related proteins  Evolutionary selection to maintain structural	 foldable and functional proteins eliminates many mutations in protein sequences. On the other hand	 thermodynamic stability can be compromised in evolution to ensure certain arrangements of catalytic and binding sites	 which might not be energetically optimal (36	 42). In tumorigenesis	 protein stability or binding may be reduced (or in some cases increased) due to cancer mutations. As a consequence it can lead to decreased fitness at the protein level	 but may confer a fitness advantage for the population of tumor cells (43	 44). However	 the extent of the stability-activity tradeoff in oncogenes and tumor suppressors remains largely unknown. Using the example of the CBL protein	 here we tried to elucidate the stability-activity balance and to understand whether the loss or gain of activity in cancer-related proteins can be accompanied by compromised stability or binding.  In contrast to many other computational studies	 which attempt to link stability with activity by mostly focusing on one protein conformation	 we performed an analysis on four different stages of the CBL activation cycle. Our predictions of changes in stability and binding were further elucidated by the experimental CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays. We found a strong relationship between the effects of mutations on CBL stability and experimentally obtained densitometry data (quantifying activity)	 while a relatively weaker correlation was observed between changes in densitometry and CBL-E2 binding affinity. It could be explained either by a less significant impact of experimentally tested mutations on CBL-E2 binding or by a limited coupling (compared to CBL stability) between CBL-E2 binding and E3 activity.  Drivers or passengers?  According to our study	 about two thirds of all experimentally tested mutations either completely abolished or attenuated E3 activity	 while one third of them were neutral. Trying to assess the limitations of our models	 we applied state-of- the-art methods commonly used to predict functional effects of mutations. However	 these methods failed to distinguish inactivating from neutral mutations as accurately as the computational models which were solely based on accounting for the effects on stability and binding for different CBL states. Indeed	 many methods are not specifically designed to discriminate driver from passenger mutations within the pool of cancer mutations	 but rather they perform a task of distinguishing cancer from neutral mutations.  Certainly	 the large majority of all mutations detected in cancer genomics studies are likely to be neutral although the collective burden of passenger mutations may also alter the course of tumorigenesis (45). When we analyzed the distribution of all single cancer missense mutations observed in the CBL gene	 their average effects on stability or binding were not found to be significantly different from the pool of random mutations. These mutations either mostly constitute true passenger mutations or their oncogenic mechanisms are not directly connected to protein destabilization. The story is quite the opposite for the recurrent mutations as they have on average significantly higher destabilizing effects than random mutations and the majority of them should be drivers. An interesting group of mutations includes those which are highly damaging but found only in one cancer sample (10% of all single cancer mutations). These mutations may represent either rare driver or latent driver mutations (46). Several of these mutations were experimentally tested and are listed in Table 1.  CBL-E2 binding in deciphering the mechanisms of cancer  Our analysis showed that cancer mutations reduce CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state. It is in contrast to the stability-activity tradeoff reported for EGFR and other cancer related proteins (47)	 where cancer mutations may disrupt autoinhibitory interactions and activate the kinase (48	 49). Importantly	 all mutations with experimentally tested high inactivating effects have impacts on both CBL stability and CBL-E2 binding (Table 1). In fact	 the correlation between Î”Î”Gfold and Î”Î”Gbind for CBL cancer mutations from COSMIC is positive (R = 0.20 â€“ 0.48 depending on the CBL state	 p-value < 0.05). It might seem counterintuitive as some residues maintain stability by sustaining the RING-TKBD autoinhibitory interactions within CBL. This interface overlaps with the CBL-E2 interface and competes against E2 binding (13). One might think that disruption of RING-TKBD interactions and destabilization of CBL might facilitate binding to E2 and therefore lead to CBL activation. A slight activation was actually observed for two mutants	 one of which (M374V) was directly located on the CBL-E2 interface. However	 as we showed through the positive high correlation between stability and activity changes	 this mechanism is rarely observed and the vast majority of mutations disrupt CBL-E3 activity by either destabilizing CBL and/or CBL-E2 binding or by directly affecting phosphorylation of the critical tyrosine Y371.  Overall	 our results support the idea that decrease of E3 activity	 of the ability to ubiquitinate receptor tyrosine kinases	 of CBL stability and/or CBL-E2 binding can give a selective advantage for tumor cells. However	 there are several factors that complicate deciphering the mechanisms of action of CBL cancer mutations. CBL mutations can be dominant-negative and mutated CBL might not only change the CBL E3 activity but also might affect the concentration and activity of the wild-type CBL. According to a ratiometric method to identify driver genes in cancer (1)	 CBL can be regarded as an oncogene since it has several mutation hot spots. On the other hand	 as shown in our study and in other studies	 cancer driver mutations can inactivate the E3 activity of CBL	 so it can also be regarded as a tumor suppressor. Although the latter fact complicates the development of CBL targeted therapies	 understanding the delicate balance among different CBL-affected pathways may facilitate the indirect drug targeting of damaged CBL proteins. The current genetics-based frameworks to analyze cancer genome-wide sequence data are necessary but not sufficient for understanding the processes of carcinogenesis and developing informed	 targeted therapies. Our approach	 which can be applied in general to different proteins of interest	 emphasizes the importance of the physics of binding and protein conformational ensembles in deducing the mechanisms of cancer.  																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			
4	19||Acquired uniparental disomy (aUPD) is a common feature of cancer genomes	 leading to loss of heterozygosity. aUPD is associated not only with loss-of-function mutations of tumour suppressor genes1	 but also with gain-of-function mutations of proto-oncogenes2. Here we show unique gain-of-function mutations of the C-CBL (also known as CBL) tumour suppressor that are tightly associated with aUPD of the 11q arm in myeloid neoplasms showing myeloproliferative features. The C-CBL proto-oncogene	 a cellular homologue of v-Cbl	 encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase and negatively regulates signal transduction of tyrosine kinases3	4	5	 6. Homozygous C-CBL mutations were found in most 11q-aUPD-positive myeloid malignancies. Although the C-CBL mutations were oncogenic in NIH3T3 cells	 c-Cbl was shown to functionally and genetically act as a tumour suppressor. C-CBL mutants did not have E3 ubiquitin ligase activity	 but inhibited that of wild-type C-CBL and CBL-B (also known as CBLB)	 leading to prolonged activation of tyrosine kinases after cytokine stimulation. c-Cbl-/- haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) showed enhanced sensitivity to a variety of cytokines compared to c-Cbl+/+ HSPCs	 and transduction of C-CBL mutants into c-Cbl-/- HSPCs further augmented their sensitivities to a broader spectrum of cytokines	 including stem-cell factor (SCF	 also known as KITLG)	 thrombopoietin (TPO	 also known as THPO)	 IL3 and FLT3 ligand (FLT3LG)	 indicating the presence of a gain-of-function that could not be attributed to a simple loss-of-function. The gain-of-function effects of C-CBL mutants on cytokine sensitivity of HSPCs largely disappeared in a c-Cbl+/+ background or by co-transduction of wild-type C-CBL	 which suggests the pathogenic importance of loss of wild-type C-CBL alleles found in most cases of C-CBL-mutated myeloid neoplasms. Our findings provide a new insight into a role of gain-of-function mutations of a tumour suppressor associated with aUPD in the pathogenesis of some myeloid cancer subsets.  Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are heterogeneous groups of blood cancers originating from haematopoietic precursors. They are characterized by deregulated haematopoiesis showing a high propensity to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)7. Some MDS cases have overlapping clinico-pathological features with myeloproliferative disorders	 and are now classified into myelodysplasia/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN) by the World Health Organization (WHO) classification8. To obtain a comprehensive profile of allelic imbalances in these myeloid neoplasms	 we performed allele-specific copy number analyses of bone marrow samples obtained from 222 patients with MDS	 MDS/MPN	 or other related myeloid neoplasms (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2) using high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays combined with CNAG/AsCNAR software9	 10.  Genomic profiles of MDS and MDS/MPN showed characteristic unbalanced genetic changes	 as reported in previous cytogenetic studies11 (Supplementary Fig. 1a); however	 they were detected more sensitively by SNP array analyses (Supplementary Table 3). aUPD was detected in 70 samples (31.5%) on the basis of the allele-specific copy number analyses	 which substantially exceeded the detection rate obtained using a SNP call-based detection algorithm (20.7%) (Supplementary Figs 2 and 4	 and Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). Long stretches of homozygous SNP calls caused by shared identical-by-descent alleles in parents were empirically predicted and excluded (Supplementary Fig. 3). aUPDs were more common in MDS/MPN than in MDS. They preferentially affected several chromosomal arms (1p	 1q	 4q	 7q	 11p	 11q	 14q	 17p and 21q) in distinct subsets of patients	 and frequently associated with mutated oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes (Supplementary Figs 1b and 5). Among these	 the most common aUPDs were those involving 11q (n = 17)	 which defined a unique subset of myeloid neoplasms that were clinically characterized by frequent diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) with normal karyotypes (13 cases) (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 6). We identified a minimum overlapping aUPD segment of approximately 1.4â€‰megabases (Mb) in 11q	 which contained a mutated C-CBL proto-oncogene (Fig. 1b).

C-CBL is the cellular homologue of the v-Cbl transforming gene of the Cas NS-1 murine leukaemia virus5	 12. It was recently found to be mutated in human AML cases13	14	 15. Together with its close homologue	 CBL-B	 C-CBL is thought to be involved in the negative modulation of tyrosine kinase signalling	 primarily through their E3 ubiquitin ligase activity that is responsible for the downregulation of activated tyrosine kinases3	4	 5. By sequencing all C-CBL exons in all 222 samples	 we found C-CBL mutations in 15 of the 17 cases with 11q-aUPD	 whereas only 3 out of 205 cases without 11q-aUPD had C-CBL mutations	 showing a strong association of C-CBL mutations with 11q-aUPD (P = 1.46â€‰Ã—â€‰10-18) (Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Tables 6 and 7)	 as also indicated in a recent report16. Thus	 C-CBL was thought to be the major	 if not the only	 target of 11q-aUPD in myeloid neoplasms. Two different C-CBL mutations co-existed in three cases (Supplementary Fig. 6b). Somatic origins of the mutations were confirmed in three evaluable cases (Supplementary Fig. 6c).  In most cases	 C-CBL mutations were missense	 involving the evolutionarily conserved amino acids within the linker-RING finger domain that is central to the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity17 (Fig. 1c). Another case with a predominant Cys384Tyr mutation also contained a nonsense mutation (Arg343X) in a minor subclone	 which resulted in a v-Cbl-like truncated protein (Supplementary Fig. 6b). In the remaining two cases	 mutations led to amino acid deletions (Î”369-371 and Î”368-382) involving the highly conserved Î±-helix (Î±L) of the linker domain and the first loop of the RING finger. According to the published crystal structure of C-CBL17	 most of the mutated or deleted amino acids were positioned on the interface for the binding to the E2 enzyme (Fig. 1d)	 making contact with either the tyrosine kinase binding domain (Tyrâ€‰368 and Tyrâ€‰371) or E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (Ileâ€‰383	 Cysâ€‰404 and Pheâ€‰418). Especially	 all seven linker-domain mutations selectively involved just three amino acids (Glnâ€‰367	 Tyrâ€‰368 and Tyrâ€‰371) within the conserved Î±L helix (Fig. 1d). Mutations were clearly homozygous in nine cases	 and the apparently heterozygous chromatograms in the other six cases could also be compatible with homozygous mutations affecting the aUPD-positive tumour clones	 given the presence of substantial normal cell components within these samples. Mutations in the remaining three cases were considered to be heterozygous. About half of the C-CBL-mutated cases carried coexisting mutations of RUNX1 (four cases)	 TP53 (one case)	 FLT3 internal tandem duplication (1 case) or JAK2 (3 cases). NRAS and KRAS mutations were prevalent among CMML (15.1%) but occurred within discrete clusters from C-CBL-mutated cases (Supplementary Tables 2 and 6 and Supplementary Fig. 5). The mutation status of C-CBL did not substantially affect the clinical outcome (Supplementary Fig. 7).  All tested C-CBL mutants induced clear oncogenic phenotypes in NIH3T3 fibroblasts	 as demonstrated by enhanced colony formation in soft agar and tumour generation in nude mice (Supplementary Fig. 8). Transformed NIH3T3 cells showed PI3 kinase-dependent activation of Akt and the transformed phenotype was reverted by treatment with the PI3 kinase inhibitor Ly294002 (Supplementary Fig. 9). When introduced into Lin-â€‰Sca1+â€‰c-Kit+ (LSK) HSPCs	 C-CBL mutants (C-CBL(Gln367Pro) and C-CBL(Tyr371Ser))	 as well as a mouse lymphoma-derived oncogenic mutant (C-CBL(70Z))	 significantly promoted the replating capacity of these progenitors (Fig. 2a). Because c-Cbl negatively modulates tyrosine kinase signalling	 and all C-CBL mutations	 including those previously reported13	14	15	16	 affected the critical domains for its enzymatic activity involved in this modulation	 C-CBL was postulated to have a tumour suppressor function; loss-of-function could be a mechanism for the oncogenicity of these C-CBL mutants3	 5. To assess this possibility and to clarify further the role of C-CBL mutations in the pathogenesis of myeloid neoplasms	 we generated c-Cbl-/- mice and examined their haematological phenotypes (Supplementary Fig. 10).

In agreement with previous reports18	19	20	 c-Cbl-/- mice exhibited splenomegaly and an augmented haematopoietic progenitor pool	 as was evident from the increased colony formation of bone marrow cells in methylcellulose culture and higher numbers of LSK and CD34-negative LSK cells in bone marrow and/or spleen compared to their wild-type littermates (Fig. 2bâ€“d and Supplementary Fig. 11). Furthermore	 when introduced into a BCR-ABL transgenic background21	 the c-Cbl-/- allele accelerated blastic crisis depending on the allele dosage (Fig. 2e	 f). These observations supported the notion that wild-type C-CBL has tumour suppressor functions	 whereas â€˜mutantâ€™ C-CBL acts as an oncogene; C-CBL can therefore be both a proto-oncogene and a tumour suppressor gene.  Mouse LSK HSPCs expressed two Cbl family member proteins: wild-type c-Cbl and Cbl-b (Supplementary Fig. 12)22. When transduced into NIH3T3 cells stably expressing human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)	 both Cbl proteins enhanced ubiquitination of EGFR after EGF stimulation	 which was suppressed by coexpression of the C-CBL mutants (Fig. 3a	 b). In haematopoietic cells	 overexpression of wild-type C-CBL enhanced ligand-induced ubiquitination of a variety of tyrosine kinases	 including c-KIT	 FLT3 and JAK2. In contrast	 C-CBL mutants not only showed compromised enzymatic activity	 but also inhibited the ubiquitinating activities in these haematopoietic cells (Fig. 3c)	 leading to prolonged tyrosine kinase activation after ligand stimulation (Fig. 3d).

Because tyrosine kinase signalling is central to cytokine responses in haematopoietic cells and its deregulation is a common feature of myeloproliferative disorders23	 we next examined the effects of C-CBL mutations (C-CBL(Gln367Pro) and C-CBL(Tyr371Ser)) and the loss of wild-type C-CBL alleles on the responses of LSK HSPCs to various cytokines. In serum-free conditions	 c-Cbl-/- LSK cells showed a modestly enhanced proliferative response to a variety of cytokines	 including SCF	 IL3 and TPO	 compared to c-Cbl+/+ cells (mock columns in Fig. 4a). However	 the enhanced response in c-Cbl-/- cells was markedly augmented and extended to a broader spectrum of cytokines	 including FLT3 ligand by the transduction of C-CBL mutants. Of note	 the effect of C-CBL mutant transduction was not remarkable in c-Cbl+/+ LSK cells except for the response to SCF	 which was clearly enhanced by C-CBL mutants even with a c-Cbl+/+ background (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 13). To clarify further the effect of wild-type C-CBL on C-CBL mutants	 both wild-type C-CBL and C-CBL mutants were co-transduced into c-Cbl-/- LSK cells	 and their effects on the response to SCF were examined. As shown in Fig. 4b	 the hyperproliferative response induced by C-CBL mutants was almost completely abolished by the co-transduction of wild-type C-CBL	 suggesting the pathogenic importance of loss of wild-type C-CBL alleles found in most C-CBL-mutated cases. LSK cells transduced with C-CBL mutants also showed enhanced activation of the STAT5 and Akt pathways on cytokine stimulation (SCF and TPO)	 which was more pronounced in c-Cbl-/- than c-Cbl+/+ LSK cells (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 14).

The modest enhancement of sensitivity to cytokines found in c-Cbl-/- LSK cells was a consequence of loss of C-CBL functions. In contrast	 the hypersensitive response of mutant-transduced c-Cbl-/- LSK cells to a broad spectrum of cytokines represents gain-of-function of the mutants that could not be ascribed to a simple loss of C-CBL functions	 which was also predicted from the strong association of C-CBL mutations with 11q-aUPD by analogy to the gain-of-function JAK2 mutations associated with 9p-aUPD in polycythemia vera2. The gain-of-function of C-CBL mutants became more evident under a c-Cbl-/- background. The hypersensitive response to cytokines induced by mutant C-CBL under the c-Cbl-/- background was largely offset by the presence of the wild-type c-Cbl allele or by the transduction of the wild-type C-CBL gene	 suggesting that the gain-of-function could be closely related to loss of C-CBL-like functions	 probably by inhibition of Cbl-b. Supporting this view is a previous report that c-Cbl/Cbl-b double knockout Tâ€‰cells showed more profound impairments in the downregulation of the T-cell receptor (TCR)	 more sustained TCR signalling	 and more vigorous proliferation	 than c-Cbl or Cbl-b single knockout Tâ€‰cells after anti-CD3 (also known as CD3e) stimulation24. This is analogous to the gain-of-function found in some TP53 mutants	 which has been explained by functional inhibition of two TP53 homologues	 TP73 and TP63 (refs 25	 26). Of note	 TP53 was also originally isolated as an oncogene through its mutated forms27. The Cbl-b inhibition-based gain-of-function model could be tested directly by comparing the behaviour of c-Cbl/Cbl-b double knockout LSK cells with that of LSK cells carrying homozygously knocked-in mutant C-CBL alleles. On the other hand	 there remains a possibility that the gain-of-function could be mediated by a mechanism other than the simple inhibition of the homologue	 because C-CBL mutants retained several motifs that interacted with numerous signal-transducing molecules. Furthermore	 considering the ubiquitous expression of CBL proteins	 it would be of interest to explore the possible involvement of mutations in all CBL family members in other human cancers.   																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
6	20|| Abstract Background  Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a heterogeneous group of disorders with a number of genetic and proteomic alterations. c-CBL is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and adaptor molecule important in normal homeostasis and cancer. We determined the genetic variations of c-CBL	 relationship to receptor tyrosine kinases (EGFR and MET)	 and functionality in NSCLC.  Methods and Findings  Using archival formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) extracted genomic DNA	 we show that c-CBL mutations occur in somatic fashion for lung cancers. c-CBL mutations were not mutually exclusive of MET or EGFR mutations; however they were independent of p53 and KRAS mutations. In normal/tumor pairwise analysis	 there was significant loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for the c-CBL locus (22%	 nâ€Š=â€Š8/37) and none of these samples revealed any mutation in the remaining copy of c-CBL. The c-CBL LOH also positively correlated with EGFR and MET mutations observed in the same samples. Using select c-CBL somatic mutations such as S80N/H94Y	 Q249E and W802* (obtained from Caucasian	 Taiwanese and African-American samples	 respectively) transfected in NSCLC cell lines	 there was increased cell viability and cell motility.  Conclusions  Taking the overall mutation rate of c-CBL to be a combination as somatic missense mutation and LOH	 it is clear that c-CBL is highly mutated in lung cancers and may play an essential role in lung tumorigenesis and metastasis.  Go to: Introduction In the US alone	 each year approximately 219	400 people are diagnosed with lung cancers	 out of which more than 145	000 of them succumb to the disease [1]. This number is roughly equivalent to the combined mortality rates of cancers of the breast	 prostate	 colon	 liver	 kidney and melanoma [1]. In addition the prognosis is usually poor and the five-year survival rate is less than 15%. There are also significant ethnic differences for lung cancer	 and the outcome is worse for blacks compared to whites. Gender differences are also striking with women having significantly better prognosis as compared to men. There are a number of genetic alterations that can occur in lung cancer. As an example	 in NSCLC	 mutations in KRAS	 p53	 EGFR and MET have been identified. Many of these pathways	 especially Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) are controlled by c-CBL.  CBL (Casitas B-lineage lymphoma) is a mammalian gene located on human chromosome 11q23.3 [2] and is involved in cell signaling and protein ubiquitination [3]. CBL proteins belong to the RING finger class of ubiquitin ligases (E3) and there are three homologues c-CBL	 CBL-b	 CBL-3 [4]. The c-CBL and CBL-b genes are ubiquitously expressed with the highest levels in hematopoietic tissues [5]. c-CBL consists of four regions encoding for functionally distinct protein domains: the N-terminal tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain	 the linker region	 the catalytic RING finger domain	 the proline-rich region and the c-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain that also overlaps with a leucine-zipper (LZ) domain [3]. Both TKB and RING finger domains are essential for ligand-induced ubiquitination of RTKs [6]	 [7]	 [8]	 [9]. The RING finger domain is required for the recruitment of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. The TKB domain includes four-helix bundle (4H)	 a calcium-biding EF hand	 and a modified SH2 domain	 which binds to phosphotyrosine residues [3]	 [10]	 [11]	 [12]. In addition	 the proline-rich region of c-CBL can associate with the SH3 domain of Grb2	 which can indirectly recruit c-CBL to RTKs via the GRB2 adaptor protein [7]	 [13]	 [14].  c-CBL also binds to EGFR and acts as the E3 that targets EGFR for ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore	 CBL desensitizes EGF signaling and opposes cellular proliferation induced by EGF [15]. EGF activation also appears to activate the tyrosine kinase SRC	 which phosphorylates c-CBL and in turn activates the ubiquitination and degradation of EGFR [16]	 [17]	 [18]. A recent study shows that defective endocytosis of EGFR is characterized by a deletion mutant and the point mutation L858R	 whereby its association with c-CBL and subsequent ubiquitination are impaired [19]. Recently	 the first human c-CBL mutations were reported in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients [20]. The mutation R420Q inhibits FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) internalization and ubiquitination [20].  Not only can E3 activity be important in oncogenesis	 c-CBL has a dual but separate function as a signal transduction molecule. We have previously shown that c-CBL is important in binding CRKL and BCR/ABL in hematopoietic cells. Also	 it can bind and modulate functions of cytoskeleton by binding to proteins like talin and paxillin. The TKB domain is important in binding to a number of molecules	 and they then function in signal transduction.  Given the critical role of CBL in normal homeostasis and cancer	 we hypothesized that it might be mutated in lung cancers. In this study	 we report novel c-CBL somatic mutations S80N/H94Y	 Q249E and W802* in Caucasian	 Taiwanese and African-American lung cancer patients	 respectively. Expressing these mutations in NSCLC cell lines lead to increased proliferation and cell motility. We show that c-CBL mutations occur with or without MET or EGFR mutations but are mutually exclusive of a LOH at the c-CBL locus. Additionally	 c-CBL LOH is associated with either MET or EGFR mutations. We thus hypothesize that c-CBL mutations might contribute to the oncogenic potential of MET and EGFR in lung cancer.

The following is their contact information: Institutional Review Board	 The University of Chicago	 McGiffert Hall	 5751 S. Woodlawn Ave.	 2nd floor	 Chicago	 IL 60637. Written informed consents were received from all patients whose tissue samples were used for this study.  Tissue Samples  Lung cancer tissue and paired adjacent normal lung tissues were obtained from 50 Caucasian	 29 African-Americans and 40 Taiwanese NSCLC patients who were recruited at the University of Chicago Hospital (Chicago	 USA) (Caucasian and African-American patients) and Taipei Veterans General Hospital of Taiwan (Taiwanese patients) after obtaining appropriate Institutional Review Board permission and informed consent from the patients. Out of 119 samples	 77 were men	 38 were women and 4 were unknown with age at diagnosis ranging from 47 to 90 years. In terms of tumor types	 53 were adenocarcinoma	 32 were squamous cell carcinoma and 34 were large cell carcinoma. 49 were stage I	 14 were stage II	 34 were stage III	 and 13 were stage IV (Table S1).  Cell Culture  Human non-small cell lung carcinoma cells A549 and H358 were maintained in DMEM and RPMI-1640	 respectively. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were cultured in DMEM. Media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum	 100 units/ml of penicillin	 and 100 Âµg/ml of streptomycin (Invitrogen	 Carlsbad	 CA). Cells were cultured at 37Â°C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2.  c-CBL Gene Mutational Analysis  Exons 2 to 16 of c-CBL gene were individually amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Primers are listed in Table S2. PCR conditions were 1 cycle of 95Â°C for 5 minutes; 35 cycles of 94Â°C for 30 seconds	 58Â°C for 30 seconds and 72Â°C for 2 minutes; and one cycle of 72Â°C for 10 minutes. PCR products were treated with ExoSAP-IT (USB Corporation	 Cleveland	 OH) and sequenced by Big-Dye Terminator Chemistry (Applied Biosystems	 Foster City	 CA). Sequencing was performed on the forward coding strand with confirmation of c-CBL alterations performed by sequencing the reverse strand as well. Chromatograms were analyzed for mutations using Mutation Surveyor v2.61 (Softgenetics	 State College	 PA).  Plasmid Constructs and Site-Directed Mutagenesis  The wild-type c-CBL cDNA insert was subcloned into the pAlterMax expression vector using XhoI and SalI restriction enzyme sites (Promega	 Madison	 WI). Using this parental plasmid pAlterMax-c-CBL	 the TKB domain double mutation (S80N/H94Y)	 the point mutation (Q249E)	 and the C-terminal point mutation W802* of c-CBL were created using the following primers: 5â€²-GCTGGCGCTAAAGAATAACCCACCTTATATCTTAGAC-3â€² and 5â€²-CTACCAGATACCTACCAGTATCTCCGTACTATCTTGTC-3â€² for the double mutation S80N/H94Y; 5â€²-CTTTACCCGACTCTTTGAGCCCTGGTCCTCTTTGC-3â€² for Q249E	 and 5â€²-CAGCTCCTCCTTTGGCTGATTGTCTCTGGATGGTGATC-3â€² for W802* along with their complementary primers using the QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis XL kit (Stratagene	 La Jolla	 CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The constructs were confirmed for the point mutations by standard DNA sequencing of both strands.  Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) Analysis  Five microsatellites on chromosome 11 (3 on 11q at or within 200 kb up or downstream of the c-CBL gene and 2 control markers on 11p) were selected for analysis (Table S3). Established microsatellite markers and respective primer sequences were selected from the GeneLoc database (http://genecards.weizmann.ac.il/geneloc/index.shtml	 Weizmann Institute of Science	 Rehovot	 Israel). Primers were custom designed and each forward primer was fluorescently labeled at the 5â€² end with FAM	 PET	 NED	 or VIC (Applied Biosystems). Primer annealing temperatures and duplex scores were evaluated with NIST Primer Tools (http://yellow.nist.gov:8444/dnaAnalysis/primerToolsPage.do; National Institute of Standards and Technology	 Gaithersburg	 MD). Primers were verified by performing PCR with control DNA (isolated from TK6 cells) and resolving the products on agarose gels. Bands were visualized with an UV transilluminator. Genomic DNA was extracted from tumor samples and paired normal lung tissue. Primers were grouped into multiplex combinations shown in Table S4. Marker D11S929 served as an internal control to check for consistency in PCRs and of peaks from capillary electrophoresis. Multiplex PCRs were carried out in a volume of 10 ÂµL that contained 1 ÂµL genomic DNA (20â€“50 ng)	 0.5 ÂµM of each primer (1.0 ÂµM total for each primer pair)	 400 ÂµM dNTPs	 1X PCR buffer containing MgCl2	 and 0.2 U Taq DNA polymerase. PCR was performed on the ABI GeneAmp 9700 PCR System under the following conditions: 5 min at 94Â°C; 30 cycles of 30 sec at 94Â°C	 1 min at 60Â°C	 1 min at 72Â°C; and 5 min at 72Â°C. The PCR products were separated by capillary electrophoresis on an ABI 3130XL DNA Analyzer. Chromatograms were analyzed with Peak Scanner 1.0 and GeneMapper 3.7 software (Applied Biosystems) for allelic alterations. The area of the peaks produced by the DNA PCR products was quantified for each allele. The ratio of the allelic areas was calculated for each tumor and paired normal DNA sample. When the qLOH (allelic ratio for the tumor peaks divided by the allelic ratio of paired normal sample) was â‰¤0.5 or â‰¥2.0 for c-CBL and at least one other 11q marker in at least two separate experiments	 the sample was considered as having an allelic imbalance and interpreted as LOH. Samples were evaluated in at least two separate experiments and samples showing prospective LOH at c-CBL repeated a third time which included a new control marker at the BAX locus (data not shown) on chromosome 19 to verify integrity of sample DNA.  Transfection of c-Cbl Constructs  The A549 cell line was transfected using the Fugene HD (Roche	 Nutley	 NJ) reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Eight Âµg of plasmid DNA	 containing either no insert (empty vector)	 wild-type c-CBL	 S80N/H94Y c-CBL	 Q249E c-CBL or W802* CBL was used for transfection in a 6-well culture plate. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and analyzed for expression.  c-CBL Knockdown  c-CBL knockdown was performed using lentiviral transduction using MISSION lentiviral transduction particles (Sigma-Aldrich	 St. Louis	 MO) as per manufacturer's instructions. Briefly	 1Ã—105 H358 cells/well were seeded in 6-well plates and infected the following day with c-CBL lentiviral shRNA constructs. To generate stable c-CBL knockdown cell lines	 cells were selected for 2 days with 1 Âµg/ml puromycin. c-CBL levels were determined using whole cell lysates by immunoblotting with anti-CBL antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies	 Santa Cruz	 CA).  Cell Viability Assay  Cells were transfected as described above in the transfection assay. Forty-eight hours after transfection	 viability of cells was assessed using Trypan Blue exclusion.  Wound Healing Assay  A549 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and cultured for 48 h until 100% confluent. The medium was then changed and the cells were transfected as described in the transfection assay. Twelve hours after transfection	 a straight scratch was made across the cell layer using a 1 ml pipette tip. The cells were then gently washed with 1Ã— PBS to remove cellular debris and the media was replaced. Photographs were taken of the wound region every 12 h until 48 h.  Western Blot Analysis  Forty eight hours after transfection	 cells were collected and washed twice in 1X PBS	 then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (0.5M Tris-HCl with pH 7.4	 1.5 M NaCl	 2.5% deoxycholic acid	 10 mM EDTA	 10% NP-40	 0.5 mM DTT	 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride	 5 Âµg/mL leupeptin	 and 10 Âµg/mL aprotinin) for 5 minutes. The lysate was centrifuged at 13	000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4Â°C	 and protein content of the supernatant was measured. Total cell lysates (50 Âµg/well) were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and the gels transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman	 Piscataway	 NJ). Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing Tween-20 (PBST) (1X PBS	 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with the appropriate primary antibody at 4Â°C overnight. Membranes then were washed three times with PBST and probed with appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were again washed three times in PBST and bands were visualized using Western blot chemiluminescence reagent (BioRad	 Valencia	 CA) on a Chemidoc Gel documentation system (BioRad	 Valencia	 CA). Antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies and used at the following dilutions (c-CBL	 1âˆ¶5000; c-MET	 1âˆ¶5000; EGFR	 1âˆ¶5000; ubiquitin	 1âˆ¶1000; HA	 1âˆ¶5000 and Î²-actin	 1âˆ¶10	000).  Flow Cytometry  Cell cycle analysis was carried out by flow cytometry. Approximately 2Ã—106 cells were grown in media containing 10% FBS. Cells were harvested by trypsin/EDTA treatment	 washed with 1X PBS three times and fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol for 2 h. Cells were washed again with cold PBS and stained with a solution containing 25 Âµg/mL propidium iodide	 200 Âµg/mL RNase A	 and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 minutes in the dark. Cell cycle analysis was performed using a Guava PCA-96 flow cytometer (Guava Technologies	 Millipore	 Billerica	 MA).  Ubiquitin Ligase Activity  293T cells were maintained in culture in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin (100 units/mL) and streptomycin (100 Âµg/mL) were transfected with 0.2 Âµg EGFR-pcDNA3 and 2 Âµg HA-tagged c-CBL constructs as indicated using calcium phosphate according to manufacturer's protocol (Profection	 Promega	 Madison	 WI). Twenty-four hours post-transfection	 cells were starved overnight in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS	 and then treated with or without EGF (100 ng/ml) for 15 min. The cells were collected and washed two times in ice-cold PBS containing 0.2 mM sodium orthovanadate then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris HCl	 pH 7.5	 150 mM NaCl	 5 mM EDTA	 1% Triton X100	 10% Glycerol	 2 mM sodium orthovanadate and protease inhibitors). Lysates were cleared of debris by centrifugation at 16	000 g for 10 min at 4Â°C. EGFR immunoprecipitations were performed on 200 Âµg of cleared lysate using 250 ng of rabbit-anti-EGFR and Protein A/G Plus Sepharose overnight at 4Â°C. Precipitations were washed 5 times in lysis buffer before boiling in Laemmli buffer. Elutions were immunoblotted with anti-ubiquitin and EGFR. Twenty micrograms of cleared lysate were immunoblotted for each of the c-CBL constructs using anti-HA.  Statistical Analysis  Mutation rates between different groups were compared using Fisher's exact test. For continuous variables	 group comparisons were performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Sidak's adjustment for multiple comparisons. Experiments involving repeated measurements over time were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA with the Greenhouse-Geisser adjustment to the degrees of freedom. Analyses were conducted using STATA (v10.1) software (Stata Corporation	 College Station	 TX).  Go to: Results c-CBL Gene Mutations in Lung Cancer  To investigate the role of c-CBL in lung cancer	 we analyzed its genomic DNA in tumor and paired normal samples drawn from multiple ethnicities. The lung tumor samples represented Caucasians (nâ€Š=â€Š50)	 African-Americans (nâ€Š=â€Š29)	 and Taiwanese (nâ€Š=â€Š40) lung cancer patients. We designed 12 pairs of primers to sequence the coding region of c-CBL gene that spans exons 2 to 16 (Table S2). We identified 8 unique somatic mutations in c-CBL exons among 8 different patients. A variation L620F	 a known SNP (rs2227988) in exon 11 was also detected. Importantly	 the eight novel non-synonymous mutations were confirmed by sequencing both strands of c-CBL genomic DNA obtained from lung tumor samples (Table 1). Moreover	 none of the 8 mutations were detected in the corresponding normal tissue	 indicating that these were somatic mutations. Four synonymous single nucleotide variations (SNVs) were also identified but were not used further in this study.  Table 1 Table 1 c-CBL mutation analysis in 119 lung cancer patient tumor tissues. Three of the 8 novel non-synonymous mutations were located in the TKB (tyrosine kinase binding) domain (S80N	 H94Y	 and Q249E)	 one in the RING finger domain (V391I)	 one in the proline-rich region (72515_72517 del ATG)	 and three in the C-terminal region (W802*	 R830K	 and A848T) of the c-CBL protein (Figure 1A and Figure S1). In Figure 1B	 we show model chromatograms of representative samples.  Figure 1 Figure 1 c-CBL mutations and LOH in non-small cell lung cancer. 11q LOH of c-CBL Gene  Paired lung tumor and normal lung tissue samples from Taiwanese patients (nâ€Š=â€Š37) were investigated for LOH. Eight (21.6%) showed LOH at the c-CBL locus on chromosome 11 while 29 samples (78.4%) revealed normal allelic contribution at the microsatellite markers (Figures 1C and D).  c-CBL Mutations in Different Ethnic Groups  The c-CBL double mutant S80N/H94Y was found in the same patient and the overall mutation rate for c-CBL in lung tumors was 6.7% (8/119). The frequency of c-CBL mutation was highest in large cell carcinoma (14.7%; 5 of 34 patients) followed by squamous carcinoma (6.3%; 2 of 32 patients) and the least was observed in adenocarcinoma (AD) (1.8%; 1 of 53 patients)	 although these rates were not statistically significant (pâ€Š=â€Š0.292). Mutation rates were 6.0% among Caucasians (0 of 20 in AD; 0 of 10 in SQ; and 3 of 20 in LC)	 13.8% in African-Americans (1 of 10 in AD; 1 of 10 in SQ; and 2 of 9 in LC)	 and 2.5% (0 of 23 in AD; 1 of 12 in SQ; and 0 of 5 in LC) in the Taiwanese population. Additionally two Taiwanese patients with lung cancer (one squamous and one adenocarcinoma) had the known SNP L620F. Ethnic differences were not statistically significant	 however the power to detect differences was low.  Mutations in MET and EGFR Can Be Co-Associated with c-CBL Alterations  Since East Asians with lung cancer have a higher frequency of EGFR and MET mutations in lung tumors [21]	 [22]	 we also determined mutations in EGFR and MET in the same Taiwanese cohort samples and compared the results with the observed c-CBL alterations (LOH and/or mutations). In the 37 samples tested	 we did not find any overlap between c-CBL mutations and c-CBL LOH (Figure 2). Of the three c-CBL mutants (including the known L620F SNP	 rs2227988)	 one of the samples had a MET mutation (N375S) and the other had an EGFR mutation (L858R). Among the 8 samples that had a LOH at the c-CBL locus 5 had an additional mutation in MET (N375S) and 2 had an EGFR exon 19 deletion. Twenty-six samples had neither c-CBL mutation nor c-CBL LOH (3 patients had a c-CBL mutation but no c-CBL LOH). Among these 26 samples 9 had a MET mutation (8 N375S	 1 L211W)	 13 had an EGFR mutation (7 exon 9 deletion	 6 L858R) and 4 had no other MET or EGFR mutation. Thus the rate of MET or EGFR mutations among patients with LOH at the c-CBL locus (7 of 8) was similar to that seen in patients without c-CBL mutation or LOH (22 of 26 patients) (pâ€Š=â€Š0.99). These 4 patients with no identifiable mutation in c-CBL	 MET or EGFR represented 10.8% of the 37 patients analyzed in the Taiwanese patient cohort. Conversely	 89.2% Taiwanese lung cancer patients have an identifiable mutation in either c-CBL	 MET or EGFR or a combination of the three genes (Figure 2). Additionally	 we determined p53 and KRAS mutations in these Taiwanese cohorts. Two p53 and 1 KRAS mutation were detected. The single KRAS mutation overlapped with one p53 mutation. This patient also had the EGFR exon 19 deletion but had no c-CBL mutation. The other p53 mutation sample had a c-CBL LOH with concurrent MET N375S mutation. Thus	 in the Taiwanese samples analyzed	 p53/KRAS mutations and c-CBL mutations were mutually exclusive (data not shown).  Figure 2 Figure 2 c-CBL mutations and relationship to MET and EGFR mutations in lung cancer. Cellular Functions of c-CBL Alterations in the Context of Lung Tumorigenesis  A. E3 activity is intact in the mutant c-CBL proteins To investigate whether the different c-CBL mutations affect the E3 activity	 EGFR was chosen as a model substrate for c-CBL E3 function. All of the c-CBL mutants tested enhanced ubiquitination of the activated EGFR similar to the wild-type c-CBL protein. This result demonstrates that the catalytic activity of the c-CBL mutants is not impaired when EGFR was the substrate. (Figure 3A).  Figure 3 Figure 3 Ubiquitination	 viability	 expression and cell cycle analysis of various c-CBL mutants. B. Effect on lung cancer cell viability The effect of a representative c-CBL mutant from each of the three ethnic backgrounds on lung cancer cell viability in cell lines was determined. S80N/H94Y double mutation	 Q249E	 and W802* were identified in lung tumor samples obtained from a Caucasian	 a Taiwanese and an African-American	 respectively. As described in methods	 the c-CBL wild-type (WT) and the above three mutants were expressed after cloning them into pAlterMax vector in A549 cells. These cells express relatively low basal levels of endogenous c-CBL (data not shown). Transfection efficiency was comparable between different groups and the number of cells transfected with c-CBL wild-type construct was about 70% compared to control cells that were transfected with the empty vector. Cells transfected with S80N/H94Y	 Q249E and W802* c-CBL mutant constructs resulted in increased number of viable cells that was 132.3%	 120.8% and 147.9% higher respectively	 relative to the empty vector control transfected cells and significantly different from the wild-type construct (pâ€Š=â€Š0.022	 pâ€Š=â€Š0.049	 and pâ€Š=â€Š0.008	 respectively) (Figure 3B). Relative levels of c-CBL protein in whole cell lysates prepared from samples obtained from a parallel experiment was determined. The c-CBL protein levels in samples representing untransfected and empty vector transfected cells were comparable and those representing the c-CBL WT and the three c-CBL mutants were comparable (Figure 3C).  C. Effect on cell cycle To investigate if the increases in cell viability in different c-CBL mutants are due to increased cellular proliferation	 a cell cycle analysis was performed. A549 cells were transfected with the c-CBL WT or the three different mutants: S80N/H94Y	 Q249E and W802*. The empty vector transfectant was used as a control. Forty-eight hours after transfection cell cycle analysis was performed as described in materials and methods. There was no significant change in the subG1	 G1 or the S phase of the cell cycle among the different mutants compared to the WT construct (pâ€Š=â€Š0.64	 pâ€Š=â€Š0.40	 and pâ€Š=â€Š0.28	 respectively). The G2/M phase of the cell cycle showed an increase in cell numbers for the three mutants	 S80N/H94Y	 Q249E and W802*	 when compared to the WT but again the difference was not statistically significant (pâ€Š=â€Š0.25) (Figure 3D).  D. Effect on cell motility To investigate the effect of the expression of the above three c-CBL mutants on cell migration	 we carried out wound healing assay as described in materials and methods. The closing of the scratch or the wound was monitored at 0	12	24	36	 and 48 h. (Figure 4A). In all the samples	 that represented cells transfected with mutants	 the wound gap was much smaller than that seen in the sample that represented cells transfected with c-CBL WT (p<0.001). We also determined the rate of wound closure for all the five groups. At 48 h	 wild-type c-CBL transfectants showed 61.1% open wound while the S80N/H94Y	 Q249E and W802* mutants showed 18.7%	 23.9% and 34.3% open wound respectively (p<0.001) (Figure 4B).  Figure 4 Figure 4 c-CBL mutations affect wound healing in A549 cells. E. c-CBL knockdown increases cell viability It is hypothesized that the LOH seen in our samples could lead to decreased expression of c-CBL. Thus we tested the effect of c-CBL knockdown in lung cancer cells. Compared to A549	 H358 lung cancer cells express relatively high levels of endogenous c-CBL (data not shown). c-CBL expression was knocked down using lentiviral construct that expressed c-CBL specific shRNA and compared the results with those that were transduced with scrambled shRNA and the results are shown in Figure 5. We identified several clones that revealed varying degrees of c-CBL knockdown showing different sets of c-CBL lentiviral shRNA knockdown efficiency (Figure 5A). Of all the clones tested	 Clone 27 was chosen for further experiments. Equal amount of cells were seeded in a 6-well plate and the cell proliferation was measured at various times and the results are depicted in Figure 5B. As expected	 number of cells increased in a time dependent fashion from 100 to 190% relative to scrambled shRNA as control in a span of 48 h (pâ€Š=â€Š0.0002) (Figure 5B). The cell cycle phases in H358 cells that were knocked down with c-CBL shRNA were looked at and compared with the scrambled shRNA. There were no discernable differences between these two constructs in the different phases of the cell cycle (data not shown).  Figure 5 Figure 5 Knockdown of c-CBL using an shRNA increases cell proliferation. Go to: Discussion Our results demonstrate that c-CBL is somatically mutated (or has LOH) in lung cancers	 and can significantly contribute to enhanced cell viability and motility. There was also a high prevalence of LOH with respect to c-CBL in lung tumors that harbored MET or EGFR mutation.  In the present study	 we have demonstrated the occurrence of c-CBL mutations in lung cancer patients	 especially with different ancestral variations. Mutations in c-CBL have been recently reported in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and myeloid malignancies. In the AML study	 the mutation R420Q located in the junction of the RING finger and the linker region inhibited FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) internalization and ubiquitination [20]	 thus contributing to the gain-in-function for the RTK. In addition	 mutations such as H398Y	 C384R	 and L380P mapped to the RING finger domain and the linker region of c-CBL that is required for its E3 activity [23]	 [24]	 [25]	 [26]	 [27]. Additionally	 homozygous mutations in the RING finger domain of the c-CBL gene were described as a result of acquired Uniparental Disomy (UPD) [26]. It is important to note that our results indicate LOH at 11q23 locus and these are mutually exclusive from missense mutations of c-CBL. The somatic mutations were all heterozygous. The mutations in AML led to abrogation of the E3 activity leading to prolonged RTK activation. In addition mutants located on the linker region surrounding the RING finger domain exhibited enhanced AKT signaling in response to cytokine stimulation [26]. In addition	 it was shown in NH3T3 cells	 that neither mutations in the RING finger nor the linker region causes transformation	 however while certain mutations perturbs the ubiquitination	 others affect receptor recycling and prolong kinase activity [28].  We report here c-CBL mutations that mapped not only to the RING finger domain	 but also to the TKB domain	 proline-rich domain and the C-terminal region	 but none mapped to the linker region as reported in the AML studies described above [23]	 [24]	 [25]	 [26]	 [29]. In addition	 8 mutants that we detected were found in different ethnic backgrounds. For example	 S80N/H94Y	 Q249E	 W802* were detected in Caucasians	 Taiwanese and African-Americans	 respectively. The results point out not only the difference between lung cancer and other cancers	 but also genetic polymorphism among different races in the same cancer. Interestingly	 there is a large disparity between African-American and other ethnic populations with lung cancer [30]. We have previously shown that there was a low frequency of EGFR and MET mutation in African-Americans as compared with Taiwanese and Caucasians [31]. In this study	 the number of African-American samples analyzed was relatively fewer and we found 3 mutations that are unique to this ethnicity. It would now behoove us to further study the genetic alterations that can occur and determine the targeted therapeutics for African-Americans. Our results provide evidence of the importance of c-CBL in tumorigenesis and potential signaling. Our prediction	 based on the AML data	 would be that the V391I RING finger domain mutation would affect the E3 activity. Also	 it will be important to determine the binding partners for c-CBL in the TKB domain and proline rich domain mutations. It has previously been shown that the TKB domain can bind to growth factor receptors and it will be important to determine the cross-binding of these mutants to MET and or EGFR. It would also be important in the future to look at fluorescence in situ hybridization/copy number changes in c-CBL in lung cancer.  c-CBL plays an important role in down regulating RTK-mediated signaling through K63 poly-ubiquitination and subsequent downregulation of RTKs followed by lysosomal degredation [3]. Mono-ubiquitination or ubiquitinated with K63-linked chains of substrates by c-CBL may lead to enhancement of biological and biochemical functions (reviewed in Hermann et al	 2007 [32]). The mutations that we analyzed in our studies all point out to the fact that the E3 activity of c-CBL on EGFR is intact; the EGFR levels in the various mutants remain same (Figure S2). Multiple kinases	 both RTKs and non-RTKs could be acted upon by c-CBL	 including ERBs	 PDGFR	 FMS	 MET	 c-Kit	 VEGFR	 FLT-1	 RON	 FGFR	 IR	 as well as SYK	 FYN	 LCK	 FGR	 LYN and c-ABL [3]. In lung cancers the relevant substrates of c-CBL in terms of degradation or signal transduction are yet to be identified.  The observation that c-CBL somatic mutations	 especially S80N/H94Y	 Q249E and W802* showed increased cell viability and cell motility that is in agreement with the physiological role for D-cbl in the regulation of apoptosis and differentiation identified in Drosophila is very significant [33]. It has been previously shown that activating c-CBL mutation downregulates EGFR signaling and decreases cellular proliferation and migration in breast cancer cell lines [34]. Although the role of c-CBL in the negative regulation of RTKs is well substantiated	 thereby suggesting that it is a natural tumor suppressor	 studies in cancer cells have revealed both tumor suppressor and tumor promoting activities depending on the type of c-CBL mutation and the number of alleles at the c-CBL locus [24]. In agreement with the above	 the three c-CBL mutants described here appear to have tumor growth and metastasis promoting properties. Although these mutants are outside of the RING finger or the linker region of c-CBL	 their downstream effects are significant so as to cause increased proliferation and migration	 but the substrate affected by these mutations are not known yet. This raises the possibility that some of the cellular functions of c-CBL are independent of its ubiquitin-ligase activity	 an area that we are currently investigating. The oncogenic nature of RTKs	 addiction of cancers to growth signals and given the clustering of c-CBL	 EGFR and MET mutations	 it is possible that the transforming effect of c-CBL mutations is most likely a combinatorial effect of the three. We also show that LOH for c-CBL was found in a significant number of samples that harbored MET or EGFR mutations. The fact that about 7% of lung tumor samples are likely to have c-CBL mutations and an additional 22% are likely to harbor c-CBL-related LOH	 makes c-CBL a highly mutated molecule in lung cancer. Since LOH alone is not enough to cause a transforming event [35]	 [36]	 [37]	 associated mutation in the MET or EGFR locus or yet another RTK discussed above may play a role in carcinogenesis. We predict that this LOH in c-CBL results in haploinsufficiency that downplays RTK ubiquitination leading to hyperactivity of the RTKs. However	 whether this is sufficient cause for tumorigenesis remains to be determined. Consistent with our hypothesis is the fact that c-cbl-/- mice have increased kinase activity in lymphocytes	 but is not sufficient for tumor formation [35]	 [36]	 [37]. c-CBL LOH could also lead to increased expression of c-CBL from the other allele to compensate for a loss of an allele. Alternately	 there could be some form of synergy working with reduced c-CBL levels and mutated receptors that exacerbate the phenotype of each alone.  Previous studies from our lab and others have shown that East Asians with lung cancers have relatively high frequencies of gain-of-function of mutations in RTKs such as EGFR and MET [31]. In a cohort of Japanese patients an activating MET mutation was identified in the splice region that deletes the juxtamembrane domain that is involved E3 activity of c-CBL [38]. This study also found that activation of MET is mutually exclusive of EGFR	 KRAS and HER2 gene mutations [38]. We failed to detect such mutations in significant numbers in lung tumor samples obtained from African-Americans (nâ€Š=â€Š29) and Caucasian (nâ€Š=â€Š50) patients. One MET mutation was identified in each of the groups whereas 1 and 3 EGFR mutations were identified in the African-American and Caucasian cohorts respectively. EGFR mutations have earlier been identified as one of the key mutations affecting lung adenocarcinoma patients in a comprehensive study of 188 patients [39]. Our study encompasses different histologies of NSCLC. However	 the published series did not find any mutations in c-CBL or MET unlike our study that encompassed different subtypes of NSCLC. It is important to note	 we have recently shown that MET mutations in lung cancer are in majority germline [31]. We have reported earlier c-CBL mutations in a small cohort of Taiwanese lung cancer samples [40]. In our efforts to understand the ethnic differences in the lung oncogenome	 we also looked at PAX transcription factors such as PAX5 and PAX8 that are highly expressed in lung cancers; however there was no preferential expression or mutations of the above genes in lung tumor samples of African-Americans. In this study	 we show relatively high frequency of c-CBL mutations in lung cancers	 especially in the large cell type among Caucasians and particularly among African-Americans. We therefore propose c-CBL as an efficacious target for lung cancers in African-Americans that needs to be further substantiated. This is all the more important because the prognosis for African-Americans with lung cancer	 especially for men is much poorer compared to their Caucasian counterparts [41].  In conclusion	 the results presented in this study demonstrate that c-CBL is frequently mutated or even lost in lung cancers. Our results support a role for c-CBL mutants that are independent of its ubiquitination activity. Given the relatively high mutation rates in c-CBL as well as RTKs such as MET and EGFR	 it is likely that their combined effect could be synergistic in promoting tumorigenesis. Oncogenic mutations in the monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) gene have been found in many tumors	 but their significance remains largely unknown. Several human c-Cbl (CBL) structures have recently been solved depicting the protein at different stages of its activation cycle and thus provide mechanistic insight underlying how stability-activity tradeoffs in cancer-related proteins may influence disease onset and progression. In this study	 we computationally modeled the effects of missense cancer mutations on structures representing four stages of the CBL activation cycle to identify driver mutations that affect CBL stability	 binding	 and activity. We found that recurrent	 homozygous	 and leukemia-specific mutations had greater destabilizing effects on CBL states than did random non-cancer mutations. We further tested the ability of these computational models assessing the changes in CBL stability and its binding to ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2	 by performing blind CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays in cells. Experimental CBL ubiquitin ligase activity was in agreement with the predicted changes in CBL stability and	 to a lesser extent	 with CBL-E2 binding affinity. Two-thirds of all experimentally tested mutations affected the ubiquitin ligase activity by either destabilizing CBL or disrupting CBL-E2 binding	 whereas about one-third of tested mutations were found to be neutral. Collectively	 our findings demonstrate that computational methods incorporating multiple protein conformations and stability and binding affinity evaluations can successfully predict the functional consequences of cancer mutations on protein activity	 and provide a proof of concept for mutations in CBL.  Keywords: CBL	 driver mutations	 protein interactions Go to: Introduction Whole exome sequencing of cancer patients has produced unprecedented amounts of data to analyze and interpret; these studies report a very large fraction of missense mutations which can potentially be implicated in tumorigenensis (1). Although some missense mutations can provide selective growth advantage to tumor cells (driver mutations)	 the large majority of them are considered to be neutral (passenger mutations). The mechanisms by which the driver variants may affect protein stability	 interactions	 and function remain largely unknown. Various computational methods have been developed to estimate the impacts of disease mutations on proteins but most of them exclusively use sequence features and do not explicitly utilize the protein three-dimensional structures	 their physico-chemical properties and dynamics (2	 3). Many cancers are characterized by (de)activation of certain proteins which may be a result of missense mutations (4). The interconversion between active and inactive states is highly regulated in proteins and it is not well understood how these regulatory mechanisms are disrupted in cancer. The development of in silico approaches to estimate the effects of disease mutations on protein activity	 stability and binding will help to define which are likely to be driver or passenger mutations. Moreover	 understanding the mechanisms of their actions would allow for prioritization of potential driver candidates for better targeted therapies to design drugs which might in turn compensate for the reduced/enhanced protein stability or activity.  The monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) RING finger ubiquitin ligase (E3) represents an exceptionally difficult yet important system to study the mechanisms of cancer mutations (5	 6). Strikingly	 proteins from this family play both positive and negative regulatory roles in tyrosine kinase signaling which is aberrantly activated in many cancers (5). Oncogenic mutations in the c-Cbl gene (referred to as CBL thereafter) were found in human myeloid neoplasms and other tumors (5) but the significance of these mutations and their impacts on CBL function were studied only for very few mutants (7). The mechanistic aspects of CBL cancer mutations can now be adequately addressed as several CBL structures have become available which represent the snapshots of different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1). All CBL proteins share a highly conserved N-terminus which includes a tyrosine kinaseâ€“binding domain (TKBD)	 a linker helix region (LHR) and a RING finger domain	 while the C-terminus comprises a proline-rich region (8). The RING domain of CBL has E3 activity and ubiquitinates activated receptor tyrosine kinases which subsequently targets them for degradation (8). At the same time	 since CBL proteins can bind to activated receptor tyrosine kinases via the TKBD domain	 they can serve as adaptors by recruiting downstream signal transduction components such as SHP2 and P13K (9	 10).  Figure 1 Figure 1 CBL activation cycle. The structures representing the activation cycle of CBL are shown. In the inactive closed state (nCBL) the protein exists in the cytosol. Upon activation of the RTK	 CBL can bind to the phosphorylated RTK (orange peptide) via TKBD ... Another aspect of CBL function which should be accounted for in modeling the effects of cancer mutations is that it can bind to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) in complex with ubiquitin (Ub) and a substrate protein	 thereby facilitating the transfer of Ub from E2 to a lysine residue of the substrate (11). The crystal structure of the inactive complex of CBL with E2 (UbcH7) was solved more than ten years ago (12) while the active phosphorylated CBL-E2 (UbcH5B) complex was resolved fairly recently (13). According to the latter study	 substrate binding and Tyr371 phosphorylation activates CBL by producing a large conformational change in order to place the RING domain and E2 in close proximity to the substrate. It was further confirmed that phosphorylation-induced conformational change is required for positioning of ubiquitin for effective catalysis (14).  Here we present a new approach	 which aims to assess the effects of cancer mutations on stability	 binding and activity of cancer related proteins. We apply computational models to four different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1) and perform blind in vivo experiments of CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination. We show a rather remarkable agreement of experimental EGFR ubiquitination by CBL mutants with the computed changes in CBL thermodynamic stability and to a lesser extent with CBL-E2 binding affinity. The computational models not only quantitatively predict the magnitude of the effects of mutations but also shed light on the mechanisms of their action. Namely	 we find that cancer mutations have greater destabilizing effects on four CBL states than random non-cancer mutations for recurrent	 homozygous and leukemia mutations. Most damaging cancer mutations happen in the sites involved in Zn-coordination and in the formation of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds within CBL or between CBL and E2. Overall cancer driver mutations affect different or multiple stages of the CBL activation cycle either completely abolishing its E3 activity or partially attenuating it. The computational models based on stability and binding affinity calculations can discriminate experimentally validated driver from passenger mutations (with the exception of two mutations) and outperform several state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods aiming to predict phenotypic impacts of mutations.  Go to: Materials and Methods Computational modeling and analysis  Mapping of CBL mutations The COSMIC database (15) stores data on somatic cancer mutations and integrates the experimental data from full-genome sequencing studies. We extracted 103 missense mutations for the CBL gene from the COSMIC database (15) that could be mapped to four available CBL structures in its activation cycle (Fig. 1). Cancer mutations were classified into different classes according to the frequency of observed samples (single and recurrent mutations)	 zygosity (homo- and heterozygous mutations)	 types of cancer (leukemia and sarcoma) and the involvement of mutations in Zn-coordination (Table S1). In addition	 all possible single nucleotide substitutions resulting in amino-acid changes in the CBL gene were performed to obtain a â€œRandomâ€ missense mutation reference set. After excluding mutations observed in COSMIC and mutations occurring on residues without known coordinates in crystal structures	 we obtained 2	102 random missense mutations (Table S1). We also searched the dbSNP database (16) but found very few benign variations in the CBL gene. Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.  Model preparation We investigated the effects of mutations on four states of the CBL activation cycle: (1) closed CBL state (nCBL)	 (2) partially opened CBL state bound to substrate (CBL-S)	 (3) unphosphorylated autoinhibitory CBL bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and (4) phosphorylated CBL bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1). It was previously noted that both UbcH5B and UbcH7 can bind specifically to CBL but only UbcH5B can facilitate ubiquitination (17). The crystal structures of nCBL (PDB id: 2Y1M) (13)	 CBL-S (PDB id: 2Y1N) (13) and pCBL-E2-S (PDB id: 4A4C) (13) were obtained directly from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (18). Only one crystal structure of the unphosphorylated inactive state of CBL bound to E2 (UbcH7) and Zap-70 peptide (PDB id: 1FBV) (12) was available in PDB. Although sequence identity between UbcH7 and UbcH5B proteins is 38%	 the structural similarity is very high with the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.04 Ã…. The unphosphorylated autoinhibitory structure of CBL-UbcH5B-S was therefore modeled based on CBL-UbcH7-S (PDB id: 1FBV) using Chimera (19). (Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.)  Minimization procedure We applied our recently developed optimization protocol for minimizing wild-type and mutant structures (20). Heavy side chain atoms without known coordinates and hydrogen atoms were added to the crystal structures using the VMD (version 1.9.1) program (21) with models immersed into rectangular boxes of water molecules extending up to 10 Ã… from the protein in each direction. Wild-type protein complexes were minimized for 40	000 steps using explicit TIP3P water model. The final minimized models of wild-type protein complexes were used to produce all mutant structures and then an additional 300-step minimization for all mutant structures was performed. The energy minimization was carried out with the NAMD program (version 2.9) (22) using the CHARMM27 force field (23). For unfolding free energy calculations we applied the optimization procedure implemented in the RepairPDB module of the FoldX program (24) which optimizes the side chain configurations to provide a repaired structure. (See Supplementary Materials and Methods for more information.)  Binding and unfolding free energy calculations Binding free energy and effects of mutations on binding affinity were calculated according to the approach introduced by us earlier (20). Energy calculations were based on the modified MM-PBSA method that combined the molecular mechanics terms with the Poissonâ€“Boltzmann continuum representation of the solvent (25) and statistical scoring energy functions with parameters optimized on experimental sets of several thousand mutations (equation 3). Binding free energy calculations were performed on minimized wild-type and mutant structures of inactive CBL-E2-S and active pCBL-E2-S states. The binding energy is defined as a difference between the free energies of the complex and unbound proteins.  Î”Gbind=GCBL-E2-S-GCBL-S-GE2 (1) The change of binding energy due to a mutation can be calculated as:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î”Gbindmut-Î”GbindWT (2) The effect of mutations on binding affinity was calculated in this work using the following energy function:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î±Î”Î”Evdw+Î²Î”Î”Gsolv+Î³Î”SAmut+ÎµÎ”Î”GBM+Î»Î”Î”GFD+Î´ (3) Here Î”Î”Evdw is the change of the van der Waals interaction energy and Î”Î”Gsolv is the change of the polar solvation energy of solute in water. Î”SAmut represents a term proportional to the interface area of the mutant complex. Î”Î”GBM and Î”Î”GFD are the binding energy changes from BeAtMuSiC and FoldX	 respectively. BeAtMuSiC (26) estimates the effect of mutations on binding based on statistical potentials.  The FoldX software program (24) was used to estimate the unfolding free energy and to model the unfolding state. FoldX calculates the effects of mutations on protein stability using an empirical force field. The BuildModel module was used to introduce a mutation	 optimize the configurations of the neighboring side chains and calculate the difference in stability (unfolding free energy) between mutant ( Î”Gfoldmut) and repaired native structure ( Î”GfoldWT).  Î”Î”Gfold=Î”Gfoldmut-Î”GfoldWT (4) For comparison we used three alternative methods to predict the impacts of mutations on unfolding free energy: the Eris server (27)	 the Rosetta program (28) and the PoPMuSiC server (29). We also applied four additional webtools to assess the impacts of amino acid substitutions on CBL function: PROVEAN (30)	 PolyPhen-2 (31)	 MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). (See Supplementary Methods for more information.)  Go to: Experimental procedures Expression constructs  Human CBL cDNA was originally obtained from Wallace Langdon and subsequently cloned into the pCEFL expression plasmid (34). Point mutation constructs	 described above	 were created from wild-type CBL using the QuikChange II Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions (Stratagene	 La Jolla	 CA). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.  Cell culture and transfections  The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T	 the human nonsmall cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the human cervical cancer cell line HeLa used in this study were originally obtained from ATCC and maintained in culture using DMEM (Gibco	 Grand Island	 NY) supplemented with 10% FBS	 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin sulfate. Cell lines were authenticated by Short Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis by using either Promega Powerplex 16 (Promega	 Madison	 WI) or the AmpFISTR Identifier Kit (Life Technologies	 Carlsbad	 CA) and compared to the ATCC or DSMZ databases. HeLa cells were received in the lab in 2013 last authenticated on 7-30-15	 A549 were received in the lab in 2015 and last authenticated on 8-12-15	 and HEK293T were received in the lab in 1995 and last authenticated on 10-8-15.HEK293T cells were transfected using calcium phosphate according to the instructions accompanying the reagent (Profection; Promega Corp.	 Madison	 WI)	 incubated 18 h prior to media change and grown for a total of 48 h prior to harvesting. A549 and Hela cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen	 Carlsbad	 CA). Transfections were allowed to incubate 6 h prior to media change	 and cells were grown an additional 48 h before being harvested. Cells were starved for 4 hours and treated with EGF (100 ng/ul). Each cell-based experiment was repeated at least two times.  Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation  To harvest proteins	 cells were washed twice in ice-cold Dulbeccoâ€™s PBS-containing 200 Î¼M sodium orthovanadate (Fisher Chemicals	 Fairlawn	 NJ) then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5	 150 mM NaCl	 5 mM EDTA	 1% Triton X-100	 10% glycerol	 100 mM iodoacetamide [Sigma-Aldrich Corp.	 St. Louis	 MO]	 2 mM sodium orthovanadate	 and protease inhibitors [Complete tabsÂ®	 Roche Diagnostics Corp.	 Indianapolis	 IN]). All whole cell lysates were cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 16	000 Ã— g for 15 m at 4 Â°C. Supernatant protein concentrations were determined using the BioRad protein assay (BioRad	 Hercules	 CA). For immunoblotting	 20Î¼g of whole cell lysates were boiled in a 1:1 dilution of 2X loading buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8	 10% glycerol	 2% SDS	 1 mg/ml bromophenol blue	 0.3573 M Î²-mercaptoethanol) for 5 m. For immunoprecipitations	 150 Î¼g of each of the whole cell lysates were incubated with rabbit anti-EGFR (Ab-3; Millipore) and with Protein A/G+ agarose beads (sc-2003; Santa Cruz Biotechnology	 Santa Cruz	 CA). All immunoprecipitations were incubated overnight at 4Â°C with tumbling. Immune complexes were washed five times in 1 mL cold lysis buffer	 then resuspended in 2X loading buffer	 boiled for 5 m	 then resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran BA85; Whatman	 Sanford	 MA). For immunoblot detection of proteins	 the following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-EGFR (2232L; Cell Signaling)	 rat monoclonal high affinity anti-HA-peroxidase	 (clone 3F10; Roche)	 rabbit anti-Cbl (sc-C-15; Santa Cruz) and mouse anti-Hsc70 (sc-7298; Santa Cruz). Horseradish peroxidase linked donkey anti-rabbit IgG (NA934V; GE Healthcare	 Piscataway	 NJ)	 or donkey anti-mouse IgG (NA931: GE Healthcare	 Piscataway	 NJ) immunoglobulin was used with SuperSignal (Pierce Biotechnology Inc.	 Rockford	 IL) to visualize protein detection.  Densitometric Analysis  Immunoblots were developed on HyBlot CL Autoradiography Film (Denville Scientific Inc.	 South Plainfield	 NJ) with an X-OMAT automated processor (Eastman Kodak	 Rochester	 NY). Protein expression levels were then recorded using an Epson Perfection V750 PRO scanner (Epson Inc.	 Long Beach	 CA) and densitometric analysis was performed using Adobe Photoshop software version 7.0 (Adobe Systems Inc.	 U.S.A). EGFR ubiquitination signal intensity was determined by optical density in a set area normalized against the EGFR band intensity in parallel immunoblots and expressed as a densitometric ratio of ubiquitination/EGFR levels. The mean densitometric ratio of EGFR ubiquitination	 in the presence of each CBL mutation	 was then assessed relative to wild-type CBL where the ratio was set at 1.0.  Go to: Results Cancer mutations impact CBL stability  We estimated the thermodynamic stability (unfolding free energy) changes	 Î”Î”Gfold	 upon mutation for closed (nCBL) and partially opened (CBL-S) CBL states (Fig. 1). These states did not involve binding to E2. The examination of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for random non-cancer mutations (Fig. 2A) showed that it was very similar to experimental distributions produced by random mutagenesis on a set of different proteins (35	 36). Namely	 the distribution for random non-cancer mutations was asymmetrically centered at positive energy values and there were about 10% of random mutations with highly damaging effects on CBL structures by more than 5 kcal molâˆ’1 (Fig. 2A). Despite the presence of highly damaging random mutations	 recurrent cancer mutations overall produced significantly larger destabilizing effects compared to random (p-value â‰ª 0.01) for both nCBL and CBL-S states (Fig. 2A and S1	 Table S2). This was not the case for single cancer mutations observed in only one patient (Table S2). Overall	 the form of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for recurrent cancer mutations was different from the Î”Î”Gfold distribution of random mutations (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p-value â‰ª 0.01) whereas the distribution for single cancer mutations was indistinguishable from a random mutation distribution. However	 it does not mean that all single cancer mutants can be considered passenger	 as we show later	 this is not the case for some of them.  Figure 2 Figure 2 (A) The distribution of unfolding (Î”Î”Gfold) and binding (Î”Î”Gbind) free energy changes for Single	 Recurrent and Random class mutations on nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states (see SI for other states). Positive and negative values ... The top 25% cancer mutations with the largest damaging effects are presented in Table S3. Many of them occurred in Zn-coordinating sites while many others did not involve Zn-coordination sites. Some of these latter mutations (G415V	 G413R and G415S) introduced large Van der Waals clashes with neighboring residues which could not be accommodated by side chain rearrangements	 whereas other mutations (S376F	 Y371D and L405P) affected disulfide or hydrogen bonds. For example	 L405P located in the middle of an Î±-helix affected the CBL structure by introducing an energetically unfavorable kink in the helix due to its inability to donate an amide hydrogen bond.  Effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding  The outcome of mutations can be assessed by the extent of structural changes they induce. We calculated the local root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between the minimized wild-type and mutant structures around the mutated site. We found that the protein backbone in the vicinity of a mutation of the CBL-E2 complex underwent larger local conformational changes upon recurrent cancer mutations	 especially for mutations occurring in Zn-coordinating site clusters	 compared to random mutations (p-value â‰ª 0.01	 Fig. S2 and S3). In the previous section we analyzed the original closed (nCBL) state and partially opened (CBL-S) state induced by substrate binding. In this section we study the effects of cancer mutations on two other CBL states: an autoinhibitory CBL state bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and phosphorylated active CBL state bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1) (13). Effects of mutations on binding can be in general linked with their structural locations	 therefore we examined the locations of mutations and found that about one third of all cancer mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface (Fig. S4). This preference was found to be statistically significant (p-value â‰ª 0.01) (Fig. S4).  It was previously experimentally shown that binding between CBL and E2 was rather weak with a micromolar dissociation constant (13). Despite the fact that the interface between CBL and E2 in the inactive state is several residues larger than in the active state	 consistent with experiments	 we found somewhat stronger binding between CBL and E2 for the active state of CBL (Table S4). Similarly to the impacts of cancer mutations on stability	 recurrent (but not single) mutations destabilized CBL-E2 binding significantly (Fig. 2B	 S1 and Table S2). Importantly	 cancer mutations reduced the CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state (p-value = 0.002) (Fig. 2B) and the effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding of the active state were noticeably larger compared to random mutations even if we excluded mutations in Zn-coordinating sites (Table S2). This latter observation does not hold true for the autoinhibitory CBL-E2-S conformation.  Next	 all cancer mutations were ranked with respect to their effects on CBL-E2 binding. About half of all highly damaging mutations (top 25% of most damaging mutations	 Table S3) impacted both stability and CBL-E2 binding for all four CBL states. Among them	 several mutations occurred in Zn-coordinating clusters and M400 and L405 sites. Another class of mutations (involving W408 and R420 sites) mostly influenced CBL-E2 binding. For example	 the W408S mutation caused the largest perturbation in CBL-E2 binding of the active state by decreasing binding affinity up to 3.5 kcal molâˆ’1 but having a moderate effect on stability of the nCBL and CBL-S states. It was previously suggested that amino acids in positions W408 and I383 constituted specificity of CBL-E2 binding and corresponded to binding hot spots (10	 12). Mutations in the I383 site are not recorded in the COSMIC database although they have a profound destabilizing effect on CBL-E2 binding for both states (see data for random mutations on the ftp site ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/panch/CBL). Another site affecting binding of CBL (R420) is a highly conserved site in the CBL family	 it strongly interacts with the Q92	 W93 and S94 residues of E2. It was previously experimentally verified that mutations in this site disrupted the CBL activity and could be associated with cytokine-independent growth (37). There are 24 cancer patient samples where mutations of this site (R420Q	 R420L and R420P) are found and they all produce strong destabilizing effects on the active pCBL-E2-S state.  According to the zygosity annotation	 there are 49 heterozygous (â€œHeteroâ€) and 27 homozygous (â€œHomoâ€) mutations (Table S1) and for the rest of cancer mutations their zygocity status is undetermined. Overall	 we found that destabilizing mutations were enriched among homozygous compared to heterozygous mutations for all stages of CBL activation cycle (p-value = 0.021 â€“ 0.035) and were more prevalent in leukemia compared to sarcoma patients (p-value = 0.000 â€“ 0.003) (Fig. 2B	 Table S2). This observation could not be attributed to the prevalence of homozygous mutations in Zn-coordinating clusters since these clusters had almost equal numbers of heterozygous and homozygous mutations. It was reported earlier that many homozygous mutations could be connected to uniparental disomy when germline heterozygosity would lead to neoplasia upon reduction to homozygosity (6	38	 39). If some patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms had germline heterozygous mutations in CBL	 then lost the wild-type CBL allele and duplicated mutant allele	 it would be possible that the damaging mutant allele would be duplicated in a cancer cell with a higher probability. Indeed	 human leukemia samples show the loss of the normal CBL allele.  CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination: comparing experiments with computational models  Next we randomly picked fifteen cancer mutations based on their predicted damaging status	 trying to equally sample highly damaging and benign mutations irrespective to their frequencies in cancer samples	 and experimentally tested the E3 activity of wild-type and mutant CBL proteins (see Methods	 Table 1). As can be seen in Fig. 3A	 in the presence of wild-type CBL	 activation of the EGFR induced more than a 10-fold increase in the ubiquitination of the EGFR compared to empty vector (endogenous CBL levels) in HEK293T cells (compare lane 4 to lane 2 in top panel of Fig. 3A). The E3 activity of wild-type CBL was mirrored by a decrease in the levels of immunoprecipitated EGFR consistent with the targeting of ubiquitinated EGFR for degradation (compare lanes 2 and 4 in second panel of Fig. 3A).  Figure 3 Figure 3 (A) EGFR ubiquitination. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant CBL proteins along with the EGFR and hemagglutinin (HA)-epitope tagged ubiquitin. The vector control and wild-type	 CBL transfectant cells were incubated ... Table 1 Table 1 Experimental relative densitometry values for HEK293T cells	 predicted changes in stability (Î”Î”Gfold kcal molâˆ’1)	 binding affinity (Î”Î”Gbind kcal molâˆ’1) and comparison with other methods for 15 experimentally ... We classified all mutations into three groups (damaging	 attenuating and benign) according to their experimental relative densitometry data and compared experimental data with the estimates produced by the computational models. The first group of damaging mutants included C396R	 H398Q	 Y371H	 K382E and C381A which completely abolished CBL activity (relative densitometry was less than 10%) (Fig. 3B) and the levels of total EGFR were not decreased by these mutants (Fig. 3A). Only two of these mutants belonged to the Recurrent class of mutations. Table 1 shows predicted and experimentally verified effects of mutations on all four CBL states. All five mutants were predicted to be damaging by stability and binding affinity calculations but the mechanisms of their action were different. C396R	 H398Q and C381A mutations disrupted Zn-coordinating clusters and had very damaging consequences according to the stability model for both nCBL and CBL-S states and damaging effects on CBL-E2 binding even though none of these mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface. On the other hand	 the K382E mutation did not affect Zn-coordination but destabilized the nCBL state. This	 in turn	 could be explained by the charge substitution that led to the disruption of the K382-E373 salt bridge within the closed state of nCBL (Figure 4 and Figure S5A). Moreover	 K382E mutation had a significant impact on CBL-E2 binding due to the disruption of a salt bridge between pY371 and K382 affecting the stability of CBL in the active state (Figure 4 and Figure S5D). No significant changes were observed for CBL-S and CBL-E2-S states (Figure S5B	C). K382E mutation was previously observed in Noonan syndrome and was speculated to affect CBL stability or binding (40). Finally	 the Y371H mutation not only abolished phosphorylation at the Y371 site but also had a profound destabilizing effect on all four states as evident from Table 1.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Structures of wild type (green) and K382E mutant (tan) are shown for nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states. Salt bridges are shown as dashed lines and in both cases mutation affects the stability by disrupting the salt bridge. The second group of mutants (M374V	 V430M	 P428L	 Q249E and double mutant S80N/H94Y) maintained the CBL activity equivalent to or greater than wild-type CBL (relative densitometry of 80% or higher) (Fig. 3B). Consistent with this	 the levels of the activated EGFR were also decreased in these samples (Fig. 3A). To confirm that the retained E3 activity of these mutants was not cell type specific	 we transfected these mutants into the non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the cervical cancer cell line Hela (Fig. S6). The S80N/H94Y and Q249E mutations were previously identified in human non-small cell lung cancers making the A549 cell line a relevant cell type to investigate the function of these CBL mutants while other cancer mutations were found in other cancer types. As in the HEK293T cells	 transfection of wild-type CBL into A549 and HeLa cells resulted in a significant increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of EGFR compared to the cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. S6). The increase in transfected CBL protein compared to endogenous CBL protein was less in HeLa than in either the A549 or HEK293T cells. Consistent with this	 the fold increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of the EGFR by wild-type CBL was smaller in Hela cells (about three fold) compared to either A549 or HEK293T cells (more than 10 fold in each). As in HEK293T cells	 the Y371H mutant did not stimulate ubiquitination compared to the vector transfected control for A549 or HeLa cells (Fig. S6A and C). The CBL mutants that were fully active in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3A and B) maintained CBL E3 activity in A549 and HeLa cells (Fig. S6). Two of these CBL mutants resulted in more ubiquitination of EGFR compared to wild type CBL. For example	 the Q249E mutant showed an increased ubiquitination of EGFR in 293T and HeLa cells while the M374V mutant resulted in higher ubiquitination levels in A549 and HeLa cells (Figure 3 and S6). Only V430M mutant was on the borderline with the densitometry ratio of 0.8. All mutations from the second group were predicted to be benign according to our computational models	 whereas V430M	 consistent with experimental data	 had a borderline destabilizing impact on CBL-E2 binding (Table 1).  Finally	 the third group constituted mutations (L399V	 G375P	 P395A and V391I) which attenuated the CBL E3 activity according to the relative densitometry data (Fig. 3B). Only one of these mutants was observed in two cancer samples while other three belonged to the Single mutation class. Concordant with this	 there were intermediate levels of EGFR (Fig. 3A). G375P and P395A mutations were predicted to have partially damaging effects while V391I and L399V were classified as benign in our predictions. Interestingly	 mutations from this third group affected only some of the CBL states. In contrast	 the highly damaging mutations from the first group had damaging impacts on almost all CBL states.  Next we tested if the reduction in CBL ubiquitination activity was directly correlated with the effects of mutations on stability (Fig. 5A). The relationship between experimental densitometry data and Î”Î”Gfold was better described by an exponential dependence with correlation coefficient (R) of 0.77 and 0.78 for CBL-S and nCBL states respectively (Table S5). Indeed	 the change in absorption between wild-type and mutant proteins which refers to a fraction of active mutants can be described by the Boltzmann equation relating the probability of a state with the energy of this state. A mutation may lead to damaging effects and a loss of function if it impacts at least one of the CBL functional states. Taking this into consideration we calculated the correlation between densitometry and stability changes taking a maximum of Î”Î”Gfold values for the nCBL and CBL-S states. As shown in Fig. 5A and Table S5	 changes in stability can indeed explain the effects of mutations on CBL ubiquitination activity with high correlation of R = 0.83. For comparison	 several alternative methods were applied to predict the effect of mutations on unfolding free energy	 they all reported correlation coefficients ranging from 0.21 to 0.52	 with only one method PopMusic reporting a statistically significant correlation of 0.52 (Table S5). The relationship between densitometry and binding affinity changes was on the borderline of significance with a linear correlation coefficient of 0.48 and 0.62 (if two highly damaging mutations were excluded) (Fig. 5B and Table S5).  Figure 5 Figure 5 (A) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (exponential model) and maximal predicted changes in stability. (B) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (linear model) and predicted changes in binding affinity of pCBL-E2-S state. ... There are various methods which predict the phenotypic effects of mutations	 (30â€“33	 41) and some of them use structural features (31	 41). We applied four state-of-the-art independent methods to predict the impacts of mutations on CBL function: PROVEAN (30)	 PolyPhen-2 (31)	 MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). Some of these methods outperformed our model in classifying cancer from random mutations since they were trained to distinguish disease from neutral variants (Table S6). However	 all four methods had a very limited accuracy in classifying CBL cancer mutations into those that disrupted function and those that did not. As evident from Table 1 and Table S5	 all methods except for PROVEAN over-predicted damaging effects of experimentally tested mutations while PROVEAN was the only method which produced a significant correlation between the densitometry data and PROVEANâ€™s score (R=0.58	 Table S5).  Go to: Discussion Stability-activity balance in cancer related proteins  Evolutionary selection to maintain structural	 foldable and functional proteins eliminates many mutations in protein sequences. On the other hand	 thermodynamic stability can be compromised in evolution to ensure certain arrangements of catalytic and binding sites	 which might not be energetically optimal (36	 42). In tumorigenesis	 protein stability or binding may be reduced (or in some cases increased) due to cancer mutations. As a consequence it can lead to decreased fitness at the protein level	 but may confer a fitness advantage for the population of tumor cells (43	 44). However	 the extent of the stability-activity tradeoff in oncogenes and tumor suppressors remains largely unknown. Using the example of the CBL protein	 here we tried to elucidate the stability-activity balance and to understand whether the loss or gain of activity in cancer-related proteins can be accompanied by compromised stability or binding.  In contrast to many other computational studies	 which attempt to link stability with activity by mostly focusing on one protein conformation	 we performed an analysis on four different stages of the CBL activation cycle. Our predictions of changes in stability and binding were further elucidated by the experimental CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays. We found a strong relationship between the effects of mutations on CBL stability and experimentally obtained densitometry data (quantifying activity)	 while a relatively weaker correlation was observed between changes in densitometry and CBL-E2 binding affinity. It could be explained either by a less significant impact of experimentally tested mutations on CBL-E2 binding or by a limited coupling (compared to CBL stability) between CBL-E2 binding and E3 activity.  Drivers or passengers?  According to our study	 about two thirds of all experimentally tested mutations either completely abolished or attenuated E3 activity	 while one third of them were neutral. Trying to assess the limitations of our models	 we applied state-of- the-art methods commonly used to predict functional effects of mutations. However	 these methods failed to distinguish inactivating from neutral mutations as accurately as the computational models which were solely based on accounting for the effects on stability and binding for different CBL states. Indeed	 many methods are not specifically designed to discriminate driver from passenger mutations within the pool of cancer mutations	 but rather they perform a task of distinguishing cancer from neutral mutations.  Certainly	 the large majority of all mutations detected in cancer genomics studies are likely to be neutral although the collective burden of passenger mutations may also alter the course of tumorigenesis (45). When we analyzed the distribution of all single cancer missense mutations observed in the CBL gene	 their average effects on stability or binding were not found to be significantly different from the pool of random mutations. These mutations either mostly constitute true passenger mutations or their oncogenic mechanisms are not directly connected to protein destabilization. The story is quite the opposite for the recurrent mutations as they have on average significantly higher destabilizing effects than random mutations and the majority of them should be drivers. An interesting group of mutations includes those which are highly damaging but found only in one cancer sample (10% of all single cancer mutations). These mutations may represent either rare driver or latent driver mutations (46). Several of these mutations were experimentally tested and are listed in Table 1.  CBL-E2 binding in deciphering the mechanisms of cancer  Our analysis showed that cancer mutations reduce CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state. It is in contrast to the stability-activity tradeoff reported for EGFR and other cancer related proteins (47)	 where cancer mutations may disrupt autoinhibitory interactions and activate the kinase (48	 49). Importantly	 all mutations with experimentally tested high inactivating effects have impacts on both CBL stability and CBL-E2 binding (Table 1). In fact	 the correlation between Î”Î”Gfold and Î”Î”Gbind for CBL cancer mutations from COSMIC is positive (R = 0.20 â€“ 0.48 depending on the CBL state	 p-value < 0.05). It might seem counterintuitive as some residues maintain stability by sustaining the RING-TKBD autoinhibitory interactions within CBL. This interface overlaps with the CBL-E2 interface and competes against E2 binding (13). One might think that disruption of RING-TKBD interactions and destabilization of CBL might facilitate binding to E2 and therefore lead to CBL activation. A slight activation was actually observed for two mutants	 one of which (M374V) was directly located on the CBL-E2 interface. However	 as we showed through the positive high correlation between stability and activity changes	 this mechanism is rarely observed and the vast majority of mutations disrupt CBL-E3 activity by either destabilizing CBL and/or CBL-E2 binding or by directly affecting phosphorylation of the critical tyrosine Y371.  Overall	 our results support the idea that decrease of E3 activity	 of the ability to ubiquitinate receptor tyrosine kinases	 of CBL stability and/or CBL-E2 binding can give a selective advantage for tumor cells. However	 there are several factors that complicate deciphering the mechanisms of action of CBL cancer mutations. CBL mutations can be dominant-negative and mutated CBL might not only change the CBL E3 activity but also might affect the concentration and activity of the wild-type CBL. According to a ratiometric method to identify driver genes in cancer (1)	 CBL can be regarded as an oncogene since it has several mutation hot spots. On the other hand	 as shown in our study and in other studies	 cancer driver mutations can inactivate the E3 activity of CBL	 so it can also be regarded as a tumor suppressor. Although the latter fact complicates the development of CBL targeted therapies	 understanding the delicate balance among different CBL-affected pathways may facilitate the indirect drug targeting of damaged CBL proteins. The current genetics-based frameworks to analyze cancer genome-wide sequence data are necessary but not sufficient for understanding the processes of carcinogenesis and developing informed	 targeted therapies. Our approach	 which can be applied in general to different proteins of interest	 emphasizes the importance of the physics of binding and protein conformational ensembles in deducing the mechanisms of cancer.  																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			
4	21||Oncogenic mutations in the monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) gene have been found in many tumors	 but their significance remains largely unknown. Several human c-Cbl (CBL) structures have recently been solved depicting the protein at different stages of its activation cycle and thus provide mechanistic insight underlying how stability-activity tradeoffs in cancer-related proteins may influence disease onset and progression. In this study	 we computationally modeled the effects of missense cancer mutations on structures representing four stages of the CBL activation cycle to identify driver mutations that affect CBL stability	 binding	 and activity. We found that recurrent	 homozygous	 and leukemia-specific mutations had greater destabilizing effects on CBL states than did random non-cancer mutations. We further tested the ability of these computational models assessing the changes in CBL stability and its binding to ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2	 by performing blind CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays in cells. Experimental CBL ubiquitin ligase activity was in agreement with the predicted changes in CBL stability and	 to a lesser extent	 with CBL-E2 binding affinity. Two-thirds of all experimentally tested mutations affected the ubiquitin ligase activity by either destabilizing CBL or disrupting CBL-E2 binding	 whereas about one-third of tested mutations were found to be neutral. Collectively	 our findings demonstrate that computational methods incorporating multiple protein conformations and stability and binding affinity evaluations can successfully predict the functional consequences of cancer mutations on protein activity	 and provide a proof of concept for mutations in CBL.  Keywords: CBL	 driver mutations	 protein interactions Go to: Introduction Whole exome sequencing of cancer patients has produced unprecedented amounts of data to analyze and interpret; these studies report a very large fraction of missense mutations which can potentially be implicated in tumorigenensis (1). Although some missense mutations can provide selective growth advantage to tumor cells (driver mutations)	 the large majority of them are considered to be neutral (passenger mutations). The mechanisms by which the driver variants may affect protein stability	 interactions	 and function remain largely unknown. Various computational methods have been developed to estimate the impacts of disease mutations on proteins but most of them exclusively use sequence features and do not explicitly utilize the protein three-dimensional structures	 their physico-chemical properties and dynamics (2	 3). Many cancers are characterized by (de)activation of certain proteins which may be a result of missense mutations (4). The interconversion between active and inactive states is highly regulated in proteins and it is not well understood how these regulatory mechanisms are disrupted in cancer. The development of in silico approaches to estimate the effects of disease mutations on protein activity	 stability and binding will help to define which are likely to be driver or passenger mutations. Moreover	 understanding the mechanisms of their actions would allow for prioritization of potential driver candidates for better targeted therapies to design drugs which might in turn compensate for the reduced/enhanced protein stability or activity.  The monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) RING finger ubiquitin ligase (E3) represents an exceptionally difficult yet important system to study the mechanisms of cancer mutations (5	 6). Strikingly	 proteins from this family play both positive and negative regulatory roles in tyrosine kinase signaling which is aberrantly activated in many cancers (5). Oncogenic mutations in the c-Cbl gene (referred to as CBL thereafter) were found in human myeloid neoplasms and other tumors (5) but the significance of these mutations and their impacts on CBL function were studied only for very few mutants (7). The mechanistic aspects of CBL cancer mutations can now be adequately addressed as several CBL structures have become available which represent the snapshots of different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1). All CBL proteins share a highly conserved N-terminus which includes a tyrosine kinaseâ€“binding domain (TKBD)	 a linker helix region (LHR) and a RING finger domain	 while the C-terminus comprises a proline-rich region (8). The RING domain of CBL has E3 activity and ubiquitinates activated receptor tyrosine kinases which subsequently targets them for degradation (8). At the same time	 since CBL proteins can bind to activated receptor tyrosine kinases via the TKBD domain	 they can serve as adaptors by recruiting downstream signal transduction components such as SHP2 and P13K (9	 10).  Figure 1 Figure 1 CBL activation cycle. The structures representing the activation cycle of CBL are shown. In the inactive closed state (nCBL) the protein exists in the cytosol. Upon activation of the RTK	 CBL can bind to the phosphorylated RTK (orange peptide) via TKBD ... Another aspect of CBL function which should be accounted for in modeling the effects of cancer mutations is that it can bind to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) in complex with ubiquitin (Ub) and a substrate protein	 thereby facilitating the transfer of Ub from E2 to a lysine residue of the substrate (11). The crystal structure of the inactive complex of CBL with E2 (UbcH7) was solved more than ten years ago (12) while the active phosphorylated CBL-E2 (UbcH5B) complex was resolved fairly recently (13). According to the latter study	 substrate binding and Tyr371 phosphorylation activates CBL by producing a large conformational change in order to place the RING domain and E2 in close proximity to the substrate. It was further confirmed that phosphorylation-induced conformational change is required for positioning of ubiquitin for effective catalysis (14).  Here we present a new approach	 which aims to assess the effects of cancer mutations on stability	 binding and activity of cancer related proteins. We apply computational models to four different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1) and perform blind in vivo experiments of CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination. We show a rather remarkable agreement of experimental EGFR ubiquitination by CBL mutants with the computed changes in CBL thermodynamic stability and to a lesser extent with CBL-E2 binding affinity. The computational models not only quantitatively predict the magnitude of the effects of mutations but also shed light on the mechanisms of their action. Namely	 we find that cancer mutations have greater destabilizing effects on four CBL states than random non-cancer mutations for recurrent	 homozygous and leukemia mutations. Most damaging cancer mutations happen in the sites involved in Zn-coordination and in the formation of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds within CBL or between CBL and E2. Overall cancer driver mutations affect different or multiple stages of the CBL activation cycle either completely abolishing its E3 activity or partially attenuating it. The computational models based on stability and binding affinity calculations can discriminate experimentally validated driver from passenger mutations (with the exception of two mutations) and outperform several state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods aiming to predict phenotypic impacts of mutations.  Go to: Materials and Methods Computational modeling and analysis  Mapping of CBL mutations The COSMIC database (15) stores data on somatic cancer mutations and integrates the experimental data from full-genome sequencing studies. We extracted 103 missense mutations for the CBL gene from the COSMIC database (15) that could be mapped to four available CBL structures in its activation cycle (Fig. 1). Cancer mutations were classified into different classes according to the frequency of observed samples (single and recurrent mutations)	 zygosity (homo- and heterozygous mutations)	 types of cancer (leukemia and sarcoma) and the involvement of mutations in Zn-coordination (Table S1). In addition	 all possible single nucleotide substitutions resulting in amino-acid changes in the CBL gene were performed to obtain a â€œRandomâ€ missense mutation reference set. After excluding mutations observed in COSMIC and mutations occurring on residues without known coordinates in crystal structures	 we obtained 2	102 random missense mutations (Table S1). We also searched the dbSNP database (16) but found very few benign variations in the CBL gene. Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.  Model preparation We investigated the effects of mutations on four states of the CBL activation cycle: (1) closed CBL state (nCBL)	 (2) partially opened CBL state bound to substrate (CBL-S)	 (3) unphosphorylated autoinhibitory CBL bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and (4) phosphorylated CBL bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1). It was previously noted that both UbcH5B and UbcH7 can bind specifically to CBL but only UbcH5B can facilitate ubiquitination (17). The crystal structures of nCBL (PDB id: 2Y1M) (13)	 CBL-S (PDB id: 2Y1N) (13) and pCBL-E2-S (PDB id: 4A4C) (13) were obtained directly from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (18). Only one crystal structure of the unphosphorylated inactive state of CBL bound to E2 (UbcH7) and Zap-70 peptide (PDB id: 1FBV) (12) was available in PDB. Although sequence identity between UbcH7 and UbcH5B proteins is 38%	 the structural similarity is very high with the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.04 Ã…. The unphosphorylated autoinhibitory structure of CBL-UbcH5B-S was therefore modeled based on CBL-UbcH7-S (PDB id: 1FBV) using Chimera (19). (Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.)  Minimization procedure We applied our recently developed optimization protocol for minimizing wild-type and mutant structures (20). Heavy side chain atoms without known coordinates and hydrogen atoms were added to the crystal structures using the VMD (version 1.9.1) program (21) with models immersed into rectangular boxes of water molecules extending up to 10 Ã… from the protein in each direction. Wild-type protein complexes were minimized for 40	000 steps using explicit TIP3P water model. The final minimized models of wild-type protein complexes were used to produce all mutant structures and then an additional 300-step minimization for all mutant structures was performed. The energy minimization was carried out with the NAMD program (version 2.9) (22) using the CHARMM27 force field (23). For unfolding free energy calculations we applied the optimization procedure implemented in the RepairPDB module of the FoldX program (24) which optimizes the side chain configurations to provide a repaired structure. (See Supplementary Materials and Methods for more information.)  Binding and unfolding free energy calculations Binding free energy and effects of mutations on binding affinity were calculated according to the approach introduced by us earlier (20). Energy calculations were based on the modified MM-PBSA method that combined the molecular mechanics terms with the Poissonâ€“Boltzmann continuum representation of the solvent (25) and statistical scoring energy functions with parameters optimized on experimental sets of several thousand mutations (equation 3). Binding free energy calculations were performed on minimized wild-type and mutant structures of inactive CBL-E2-S and active pCBL-E2-S states. The binding energy is defined as a difference between the free energies of the complex and unbound proteins.  Î”Gbind=GCBL-E2-S-GCBL-S-GE2 (1) The change of binding energy due to a mutation can be calculated as:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î”Gbindmut-Î”GbindWT (2) The effect of mutations on binding affinity was calculated in this work using the following energy function:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î±Î”Î”Evdw+Î²Î”Î”Gsolv+Î³Î”SAmut+ÎµÎ”Î”GBM+Î»Î”Î”GFD+Î´ (3) Here Î”Î”Evdw is the change of the van der Waals interaction energy and Î”Î”Gsolv is the change of the polar solvation energy of solute in water. Î”SAmut represents a term proportional to the interface area of the mutant complex. Î”Î”GBM and Î”Î”GFD are the binding energy changes from BeAtMuSiC and FoldX	 respectively. BeAtMuSiC (26) estimates the effect of mutations on binding based on statistical potentials.  The FoldX software program (24) was used to estimate the unfolding free energy and to model the unfolding state. FoldX calculates the effects of mutations on protein stability using an empirical force field. The BuildModel module was used to introduce a mutation	 optimize the configurations of the neighboring side chains and calculate the difference in stability (unfolding free energy) between mutant ( Î”Gfoldmut) and repaired native structure ( Î”GfoldWT).  Î”Î”Gfold=Î”Gfoldmut-Î”GfoldWT (4) For comparison we used three alternative methods to predict the impacts of mutations on unfolding free energy: the Eris server (27)	 the Rosetta program (28) and the PoPMuSiC server (29). We also applied four additional webtools to assess the impacts of amino acid substitutions on CBL function: PROVEAN (30)	 PolyPhen-2 (31)	 MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). (See Supplementary Methods for more information.)  Go to: Experimental procedures Expression constructs  Human CBL cDNA was originally obtained from Wallace Langdon and subsequently cloned into the pCEFL expression plasmid (34). Point mutation constructs	 described above	 were created from wild-type CBL using the QuikChange II Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions (Stratagene	 La Jolla	 CA). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.  Cell culture and transfections  The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T	 the human nonsmall cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the human cervical cancer cell line HeLa used in this study were originally obtained from ATCC and maintained in culture using DMEM (Gibco	 Grand Island	 NY) supplemented with 10% FBS	 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin sulfate. Cell lines were authenticated by Short Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis by using either Promega Powerplex 16 (Promega	 Madison	 WI) or the AmpFISTR Identifier Kit (Life Technologies	 Carlsbad	 CA) and compared to the ATCC or DSMZ databases. HeLa cells were received in the lab in 2013 last authenticated on 7-30-15	 A549 were received in the lab in 2015 and last authenticated on 8-12-15	 and HEK293T were received in the lab in 1995 and last authenticated on 10-8-15.HEK293T cells were transfected using calcium phosphate according to the instructions accompanying the reagent (Profection; Promega Corp.	 Madison	 WI)	 incubated 18 h prior to media change and grown for a total of 48 h prior to harvesting. A549 and Hela cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen	 Carlsbad	 CA). Transfections were allowed to incubate 6 h prior to media change	 and cells were grown an additional 48 h before being harvested. Cells were starved for 4 hours and treated with EGF (100 ng/ul). Each cell-based experiment was repeated at least two times.  Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation  To harvest proteins	 cells were washed twice in ice-cold Dulbeccoâ€™s PBS-containing 200 Î¼M sodium orthovanadate (Fisher Chemicals	 Fairlawn	 NJ) then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5	 150 mM NaCl	 5 mM EDTA	 1% Triton X-100	 10% glycerol	 100 mM iodoacetamide [Sigma-Aldrich Corp.	 St. Louis	 MO]	 2 mM sodium orthovanadate	 and protease inhibitors [Complete tabsÂ®	 Roche Diagnostics Corp.	 Indianapolis	 IN]). All whole cell lysates were cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 16	000 Ã— g for 15 m at 4 Â°C. Supernatant protein concentrations were determined using the BioRad protein assay (BioRad	 Hercules	 CA). For immunoblotting	 20Î¼g of whole cell lysates were boiled in a 1:1 dilution of 2X loading buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8	 10% glycerol	 2% SDS	 1 mg/ml bromophenol blue	 0.3573 M Î²-mercaptoethanol) for 5 m. For immunoprecipitations	 150 Î¼g of each of the whole cell lysates were incubated with rabbit anti-EGFR (Ab-3; Millipore) and with Protein A/G+ agarose beads (sc-2003; Santa Cruz Biotechnology	 Santa Cruz	 CA). All immunoprecipitations were incubated overnight at 4Â°C with tumbling. Immune complexes were washed five times in 1 mL cold lysis buffer	 then resuspended in 2X loading buffer	 boiled for 5 m	 then resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran BA85; Whatman	 Sanford	 MA). For immunoblot detection of proteins	 the following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-EGFR (2232L; Cell Signaling)	 rat monoclonal high affinity anti-HA-peroxidase	 (clone 3F10; Roche)	 rabbit anti-Cbl (sc-C-15; Santa Cruz) and mouse anti-Hsc70 (sc-7298; Santa Cruz). Horseradish peroxidase linked donkey anti-rabbit IgG (NA934V; GE Healthcare	 Piscataway	 NJ)	 or donkey anti-mouse IgG (NA931: GE Healthcare	 Piscataway	 NJ) immunoglobulin was used with SuperSignal (Pierce Biotechnology Inc.	 Rockford	 IL) to visualize protein detection.  Densitometric Analysis  Immunoblots were developed on HyBlot CL Autoradiography Film (Denville Scientific Inc.	 South Plainfield	 NJ) with an X-OMAT automated processor (Eastman Kodak	 Rochester	 NY). Protein expression levels were then recorded using an Epson Perfection V750 PRO scanner (Epson Inc.	 Long Beach	 CA) and densitometric analysis was performed using Adobe Photoshop software version 7.0 (Adobe Systems Inc.	 U.S.A). EGFR ubiquitination signal intensity was determined by optical density in a set area normalized against the EGFR band intensity in parallel immunoblots and expressed as a densitometric ratio of ubiquitination/EGFR levels. The mean densitometric ratio of EGFR ubiquitination	 in the presence of each CBL mutation	 was then assessed relative to wild-type CBL where the ratio was set at 1.0.  Go to: Results Cancer mutations impact CBL stability  We estimated the thermodynamic stability (unfolding free energy) changes	 Î”Î”Gfold	 upon mutation for closed (nCBL) and partially opened (CBL-S) CBL states (Fig. 1). These states did not involve binding to E2. The examination of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for random non-cancer mutations (Fig. 2A) showed that it was very similar to experimental distributions produced by random mutagenesis on a set of different proteins (35	 36). Namely	 the distribution for random non-cancer mutations was asymmetrically centered at positive energy values and there were about 10% of random mutations with highly damaging effects on CBL structures by more than 5 kcal molâˆ’1 (Fig. 2A). Despite the presence of highly damaging random mutations	 recurrent cancer mutations overall produced significantly larger destabilizing effects compared to random (p-value â‰ª 0.01) for both nCBL and CBL-S states (Fig. 2A and S1	 Table S2). This was not the case for single cancer mutations observed in only one patient (Table S2). Overall	 the form of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for recurrent cancer mutations was different from the Î”Î”Gfold distribution of random mutations (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p-value â‰ª 0.01) whereas the distribution for single cancer mutations was indistinguishable from a random mutation distribution. However	 it does not mean that all single cancer mutants can be considered passenger	 as we show later	 this is not the case for some of them.  Figure 2 Figure 2 (A) The distribution of unfolding (Î”Î”Gfold) and binding (Î”Î”Gbind) free energy changes for Single	 Recurrent and Random class mutations on nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states (see SI for other states). Positive and negative values ... The top 25% cancer mutations with the largest damaging effects are presented in Table S3. Many of them occurred in Zn-coordinating sites while many others did not involve Zn-coordination sites. Some of these latter mutations (G415V	 G413R and G415S) introduced large Van der Waals clashes with neighboring residues which could not be accommodated by side chain rearrangements	 whereas other mutations (S376F	 Y371D and L405P) affected disulfide or hydrogen bonds. For example	 L405P located in the middle of an Î±-helix affected the CBL structure by introducing an energetically unfavorable kink in the helix due to its inability to donate an amide hydrogen bond.  Effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding  The outcome of mutations can be assessed by the extent of structural changes they induce. We calculated the local root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between the minimized wild-type and mutant structures around the mutated site. We found that the protein backbone in the vicinity of a mutation of the CBL-E2 complex underwent larger local conformational changes upon recurrent cancer mutations	 especially for mutations occurring in Zn-coordinating site clusters	 compared to random mutations (p-value â‰ª 0.01	 Fig. S2 and S3). In the previous section we analyzed the original closed (nCBL) state and partially opened (CBL-S) state induced by substrate binding. In this section we study the effects of cancer mutations on two other CBL states: an autoinhibitory CBL state bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and phosphorylated active CBL state bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1) (13). Effects of mutations on binding can be in general linked with their structural locations	 therefore we examined the locations of mutations and found that about one third of all cancer mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface (Fig. S4). This preference was found to be statistically significant (p-value â‰ª 0.01) (Fig. S4).  It was previously experimentally shown that binding between CBL and E2 was rather weak with a micromolar dissociation constant (13). Despite the fact that the interface between CBL and E2 in the inactive state is several residues larger than in the active state	 consistent with experiments	 we found somewhat stronger binding between CBL and E2 for the active state of CBL (Table S4). Similarly to the impacts of cancer mutations on stability	 recurrent (but not single) mutations destabilized CBL-E2 binding significantly (Fig. 2B	 S1 and Table S2). Importantly	 cancer mutations reduced the CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state (p-value = 0.002) (Fig. 2B) and the effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding of the active state were noticeably larger compared to random mutations even if we excluded mutations in Zn-coordinating sites (Table S2). This latter observation does not hold true for the autoinhibitory CBL-E2-S conformation.  Next	 all cancer mutations were ranked with respect to their effects on CBL-E2 binding. About half of all highly damaging mutations (top 25% of most damaging mutations	 Table S3) impacted both stability and CBL-E2 binding for all four CBL states. Among them	 several mutations occurred in Zn-coordinating clusters and M400 and L405 sites. Another class of mutations (involving W408 and R420 sites) mostly influenced CBL-E2 binding. For example	 the W408S mutation caused the largest perturbation in CBL-E2 binding of the active state by decreasing binding affinity up to 3.5 kcal molâˆ’1 but having a moderate effect on stability of the nCBL and CBL-S states. It was previously suggested that amino acids in positions W408 and I383 constituted specificity of CBL-E2 binding and corresponded to binding hot spots (10	 12). Mutations in the I383 site are not recorded in the COSMIC database although they have a profound destabilizing effect on CBL-E2 binding for both states (see data for random mutations on the ftp site ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/panch/CBL). Another site affecting binding of CBL (R420) is a highly conserved site in the CBL family	 it strongly interacts with the Q92	 W93 and S94 residues of E2. It was previously experimentally verified that mutations in this site disrupted the CBL activity and could be associated with cytokine-independent growth (37). There are 24 cancer patient samples where mutations of this site (R420Q	 R420L and R420P) are found and they all produce strong destabilizing effects on the active pCBL-E2-S state.  According to the zygosity annotation	 there are 49 heterozygous (â€œHeteroâ€) and 27 homozygous (â€œHomoâ€) mutations (Table S1) and for the rest of cancer mutations their zygocity status is undetermined. Overall	 we found that destabilizing mutations were enriched among homozygous compared to heterozygous mutations for all stages of CBL activation cycle (p-value = 0.021 â€“ 0.035) and were more prevalent in leukemia compared to sarcoma patients (p-value = 0.000 â€“ 0.003) (Fig. 2B	 Table S2). This observation could not be attributed to the prevalence of homozygous mutations in Zn-coordinating clusters since these clusters had almost equal numbers of heterozygous and homozygous mutations. It was reported earlier that many homozygous mutations could be connected to uniparental disomy when germline heterozygosity would lead to neoplasia upon reduction to homozygosity (6	38	 39). If some patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms had germline heterozygous mutations in CBL	 then lost the wild-type CBL allele and duplicated mutant allele	 it would be possible that the damaging mutant allele would be duplicated in a cancer cell with a higher probability. Indeed	 human leukemia samples show the loss of the normal CBL allele.  CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination: comparing experiments with computational models  Next we randomly picked fifteen cancer mutations based on their predicted damaging status	 trying to equally sample highly damaging and benign mutations irrespective to their frequencies in cancer samples	 and experimentally tested the E3 activity of wild-type and mutant CBL proteins (see Methods	 Table 1). As can be seen in Fig. 3A	 in the presence of wild-type CBL	 activation of the EGFR induced more than a 10-fold increase in the ubiquitination of the EGFR compared to empty vector (endogenous CBL levels) in HEK293T cells (compare lane 4 to lane 2 in top panel of Fig. 3A). The E3 activity of wild-type CBL was mirrored by a decrease in the levels of immunoprecipitated EGFR consistent with the targeting of ubiquitinated EGFR for degradation (compare lanes 2 and 4 in second panel of Fig. 3A).  Figure 3 Figure 3 (A) EGFR ubiquitination. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant CBL proteins along with the EGFR and hemagglutinin (HA)-epitope tagged ubiquitin. The vector control and wild-type	 CBL transfectant cells were incubated ... Table 1 Table 1 Experimental relative densitometry values for HEK293T cells	 predicted changes in stability (Î”Î”Gfold kcal molâˆ’1)	 binding affinity (Î”Î”Gbind kcal molâˆ’1) and comparison with other methods for 15 experimentally ... We classified all mutations into three groups (damaging	 attenuating and benign) according to their experimental relative densitometry data and compared experimental data with the estimates produced by the computational models. The first group of damaging mutants included C396R	 H398Q	 Y371H	 K382E and C381A which completely abolished CBL activity (relative densitometry was less than 10%) (Fig. 3B) and the levels of total EGFR were not decreased by these mutants (Fig. 3A). Only two of these mutants belonged to the Recurrent class of mutations. Table 1 shows predicted and experimentally verified effects of mutations on all four CBL states. All five mutants were predicted to be damaging by stability and binding affinity calculations but the mechanisms of their action were different. C396R	 H398Q and C381A mutations disrupted Zn-coordinating clusters and had very damaging consequences according to the stability model for both nCBL and CBL-S states and damaging effects on CBL-E2 binding even though none of these mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface. On the other hand	 the K382E mutation did not affect Zn-coordination but destabilized the nCBL state. This	 in turn	 could be explained by the charge substitution that led to the disruption of the K382-E373 salt bridge within the closed state of nCBL (Figure 4 and Figure S5A). Moreover	 K382E mutation had a significant impact on CBL-E2 binding due to the disruption of a salt bridge between pY371 and K382 affecting the stability of CBL in the active state (Figure 4 and Figure S5D). No significant changes were observed for CBL-S and CBL-E2-S states (Figure S5B	C). K382E mutation was previously observed in Noonan syndrome and was speculated to affect CBL stability or binding (40). Finally	 the Y371H mutation not only abolished phosphorylation at the Y371 site but also had a profound destabilizing effect on all four states as evident from Table 1.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Structures of wild type (green) and K382E mutant (tan) are shown for nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states. Salt bridges are shown as dashed lines and in both cases mutation affects the stability by disrupting the salt bridge. The second group of mutants (M374V	 V430M	 P428L	 Q249E and double mutant S80N/H94Y) maintained the CBL activity equivalent to or greater than wild-type CBL (relative densitometry of 80% or higher) (Fig. 3B). Consistent with this	 the levels of the activated EGFR were also decreased in these samples (Fig. 3A). To confirm that the retained E3 activity of these mutants was not cell type specific	 we transfected these mutants into the non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the cervical cancer cell line Hela (Fig. S6). The S80N/H94Y and Q249E mutations were previously identified in human non-small cell lung cancers making the A549 cell line a relevant cell type to investigate the function of these CBL mutants while other cancer mutations were found in other cancer types. As in the HEK293T cells	 transfection of wild-type CBL into A549 and HeLa cells resulted in a significant increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of EGFR compared to the cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. S6). The increase in transfected CBL protein compared to endogenous CBL protein was less in HeLa than in either the A549 or HEK293T cells. Consistent with this	 the fold increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of the EGFR by wild-type CBL was smaller in Hela cells (about three fold) compared to either A549 or HEK293T cells (more than 10 fold in each). As in HEK293T cells	 the Y371H mutant did not stimulate ubiquitination compared to the vector transfected control for A549 or HeLa cells (Fig. S6A and C). The CBL mutants that were fully active in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3A and B) maintained CBL E3 activity in A549 and HeLa cells (Fig. S6). Two of these CBL mutants resulted in more ubiquitination of EGFR compared to wild type CBL. For example	 the Q249E mutant showed an increased ubiquitination of EGFR in 293T and HeLa cells while the M374V mutant resulted in higher ubiquitination levels in A549 and HeLa cells (Figure 3 and S6). Only V430M mutant was on the borderline with the densitometry ratio of 0.8. All mutations from the second group were predicted to be benign according to our computational models	 whereas V430M	 consistent with experimental data	 had a borderline destabilizing impact on CBL-E2 binding (Table 1).  Finally	 the third group constituted mutations (L399V	 G375P	 P395A and V391I) which attenuated the CBL E3 activity according to the relative densitometry data (Fig. 3B). Only one of these mutants was observed in two cancer samples while other three belonged to the Single mutation class. Concordant with this	 there were intermediate levels of EGFR (Fig. 3A). G375P and P395A mutations were predicted to have partially damaging effects while V391I and L399V were classified as benign in our predictions. Interestingly	 mutations from this third group affected only some of the CBL states. In contrast	 the highly damaging mutations from the first group had damaging impacts on almost all CBL states.  Next we tested if the reduction in CBL ubiquitination activity was directly correlated with the effects of mutations on stability (Fig. 5A). The relationship between experimental densitometry data and Î”Î”Gfold was better described by an exponential dependence with correlation coefficient (R) of 0.77 and 0.78 for CBL-S and nCBL states respectively (Table S5). Indeed	 the change in absorption between wild-type and mutant proteins which refers to a fraction of active mutants can be described by the Boltzmann equation relating the probability of a state with the energy of this state. A mutation may lead to damaging effects and a loss of function if it impacts at least one of the CBL functional states. Taking this into consideration we calculated the correlation between densitometry and stability changes taking a maximum of Î”Î”Gfold values for the nCBL and CBL-S states. As shown in Fig. 5A and Table S5	 changes in stability can indeed explain the effects of mutations on CBL ubiquitination activity with high correlation of R = 0.83. For comparison	 several alternative methods were applied to predict the effect of mutations on unfolding free energy	 they all reported correlation coefficients ranging from 0.21 to 0.52	 with only one method PopMusic reporting a statistically significant correlation of 0.52 (Table S5). The relationship between densitometry and binding affinity changes was on the borderline of significance with a linear correlation coefficient of 0.48 and 0.62 (if two highly damaging mutations were excluded) (Fig. 5B and Table S5).  Figure 5 Figure 5 (A) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (exponential model) and maximal predicted changes in stability. (B) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (linear model) and predicted changes in binding affinity of pCBL-E2-S state. ... There are various methods which predict the phenotypic effects of mutations	 (30â€“33	 41) and some of them use structural features (31	 41). We applied four state-of-the-art independent methods to predict the impacts of mutations on CBL function: PROVEAN (30)	 PolyPhen-2 (31)	 MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). Some of these methods outperformed our model in classifying cancer from random mutations since they were trained to distinguish disease from neutral variants (Table S6). However	 all four methods had a very limited accuracy in classifying CBL cancer mutations into those that disrupted function and those that did not. As evident from Table 1 and Table S5	 all methods except for PROVEAN over-predicted damaging effects of experimentally tested mutations while PROVEAN was the only method which produced a significant correlation between the densitometry data and PROVEANâ€™s score (R=0.58	 Table S5).  Go to: Discussion Stability-activity balance in cancer related proteins  Evolutionary selection to maintain structural	 foldable and functional proteins eliminates many mutations in protein sequences. On the other hand	 thermodynamic stability can be compromised in evolution to ensure certain arrangements of catalytic and binding sites	 which might not be energetically optimal (36	 42). In tumorigenesis	 protein stability or binding may be reduced (or in some cases increased) due to cancer mutations. As a consequence it can lead to decreased fitness at the protein level	 but may confer a fitness advantage for the population of tumor cells (43	 44). However	 the extent of the stability-activity tradeoff in oncogenes and tumor suppressors remains largely unknown. Using the example of the CBL protein	 here we tried to elucidate the stability-activity balance and to understand whether the loss or gain of activity in cancer-related proteins can be accompanied by compromised stability or binding.  In contrast to many other computational studies	 which attempt to link stability with activity by mostly focusing on one protein conformation	 we performed an analysis on four different stages of the CBL activation cycle. Our predictions of changes in stability and binding were further elucidated by the experimental CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays. We found a strong relationship between the effects of mutations on CBL stability and experimentally obtained densitometry data (quantifying activity)	 while a relatively weaker correlation was observed between changes in densitometry and CBL-E2 binding affinity. It could be explained either by a less significant impact of experimentally tested mutations on CBL-E2 binding or by a limited coupling (compared to CBL stability) between CBL-E2 binding and E3 activity.  Drivers or passengers?  According to our study	 about two thirds of all experimentally tested mutations either completely abolished or attenuated E3 activity	 while one third of them were neutral. Trying to assess the limitations of our models	 we applied state-of- the-art methods commonly used to predict functional effects of mutations. However	 these methods failed to distinguish inactivating from neutral mutations as accurately as the computational models which were solely based on accounting for the effects on stability and binding for different CBL states. Indeed	 many methods are not specifically designed to discriminate driver from passenger mutations within the pool of cancer mutations	 but rather they perform a task of distinguishing cancer from neutral mutations.  Certainly	 the large majority of all mutations detected in cancer genomics studies are likely to be neutral although the collective burden of passenger mutations may also alter the course of tumorigenesis (45). When we analyzed the distribution of all single cancer missense mutations observed in the CBL gene	 their average effects on stability or binding were not found to be significantly different from the pool of random mutations. These mutations either mostly constitute true passenger mutations or their oncogenic mechanisms are not directly connected to protein destabilization. The story is quite the opposite for the recurrent mutations as they have on average significantly higher destabilizing effects than random mutations and the majority of them should be drivers. An interesting group of mutations includes those which are highly damaging but found only in one cancer sample (10% of all single cancer mutations). These mutations may represent either rare driver or latent driver mutations (46). Several of these mutations were experimentally tested and are listed in Table 1.  CBL-E2 binding in deciphering the mechanisms of cancer  Our analysis showed that cancer mutations reduce CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state. It is in contrast to the stability-activity tradeoff reported for EGFR and other cancer related proteins (47)	 where cancer mutations may disrupt autoinhibitory interactions and activate the kinase (48	 49). Importantly	 all mutations with experimentally tested high inactivating effects have impacts on both CBL stability and CBL-E2 binding (Table 1). In fact	 the correlation between Î”Î”Gfold and Î”Î”Gbind for CBL cancer mutations from COSMIC is positive (R = 0.20 â€“ 0.48 depending on the CBL state	 p-value < 0.05). It might seem counterintuitive as some residues maintain stability by sustaining the RING-TKBD autoinhibitory interactions within CBL. This interface overlaps with the CBL-E2 interface and competes against E2 binding (13). One might think that disruption of RING-TKBD interactions and destabilization of CBL might facilitate binding to E2 and therefore lead to CBL activation. A slight activation was actually observed for two mutants	 one of which (M374V) was directly located on the CBL-E2 interface. However	 as we showed through the positive high correlation between stability and activity changes	 this mechanism is rarely observed and the vast majority of mutations disrupt CBL-E3 activity by either destabilizing CBL and/or CBL-E2 binding or by directly affecting phosphorylation of the critical tyrosine Y371.  Overall	 our results support the idea that decrease of E3 activity	 of the ability to ubiquitinate receptor tyrosine kinases	 of CBL stability and/or CBL-E2 binding can give a selective advantage for tumor cells. However	 there are several factors that complicate deciphering the mechanisms of action of CBL cancer mutations. CBL mutations can be dominant-negative and mutated CBL might not only change the CBL E3 activity but also might affect the concentration and activity of the wild-type CBL. According to a ratiometric method to identify driver genes in cancer (1)	 CBL can be regarded as an oncogene since it has several mutation hot spots. On the other hand	 as shown in our study and in other studies	 cancer driver mutations can inactivate the E3 activity of CBL	 so it can also be regarded as a tumor suppressor. Although the latter fact complicates the development of CBL targeted therapies	 understanding the delicate balance among different CBL-affected pathways may facilitate the indirect drug targeting of damaged CBL proteins. The current genetics-based frameworks to analyze cancer genome-wide sequence data are necessary but not sufficient for understanding the processes of carcinogenesis and developing informed	 targeted therapies. Our approach	 which can be applied in general to different proteins of interest	 emphasizes the importance of the physics of binding and protein conformational ensembles in deducing the mechanisms of cancer.  																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			
4	22||Oncogenic mutations in the monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) gene have been found in many tumors	 but their significance remains largely unknown. Several human c-Cbl (CBL) structures have recently been solved depicting the protein at different stages of its activation cycle and thus provide mechanistic insight underlying how stability-activity tradeoffs in cancer-related proteins may influence disease onset and progression. In this study	 we computationally modeled the effects of missense cancer mutations on structures representing four stages of the CBL activation cycle to identify driver mutations that affect CBL stability	 binding	 and activity. We found that recurrent	 homozygous	 and leukemia-specific mutations had greater destabilizing effects on CBL states than did random non-cancer mutations. We further tested the ability of these computational models assessing the changes in CBL stability and its binding to ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2	 by performing blind CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays in cells. Experimental CBL ubiquitin ligase activity was in agreement with the predicted changes in CBL stability and	 to a lesser extent	 with CBL-E2 binding affinity. Two-thirds of all experimentally tested mutations affected the ubiquitin ligase activity by either destabilizing CBL or disrupting CBL-E2 binding	 whereas about one-third of tested mutations were found to be neutral. Collectively	 our findings demonstrate that computational methods incorporating multiple protein conformations and stability and binding affinity evaluations can successfully predict the functional consequences of cancer mutations on protein activity	 and provide a proof of concept for mutations in CBL.  Keywords: CBL	 driver mutations	 protein interactions Go to: Introduction Whole exome sequencing of cancer patients has produced unprecedented amounts of data to analyze and interpret; these studies report a very large fraction of missense mutations which can potentially be implicated in tumorigenensis (1). Although some missense mutations can provide selective growth advantage to tumor cells (driver mutations)	 the large majority of them are considered to be neutral (passenger mutations). The mechanisms by which the driver variants may affect protein stability	 interactions	 and function remain largely unknown. Various computational methods have been developed to estimate the impacts of disease mutations on proteins but most of them exclusively use sequence features and do not explicitly utilize the protein three-dimensional structures	 their physico-chemical properties and dynamics (2	 3). Many cancers are characterized by (de)activation of certain proteins which may be a result of missense mutations (4). The interconversion between active and inactive states is highly regulated in proteins and it is not well understood how these regulatory mechanisms are disrupted in cancer. The development of in silico approaches to estimate the effects of disease mutations on protein activity	 stability and binding will help to define which are likely to be driver or passenger mutations. Moreover	 understanding the mechanisms of their actions would allow for prioritization of potential driver candidates for better targeted therapies to design drugs which might in turn compensate for the reduced/enhanced protein stability or activity.  The monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) RING finger ubiquitin ligase (E3) represents an exceptionally difficult yet important system to study the mechanisms of cancer mutations (5	 6). Strikingly	 proteins from this family play both positive and negative regulatory roles in tyrosine kinase signaling which is aberrantly activated in many cancers (5). Oncogenic mutations in the c-Cbl gene (referred to as CBL thereafter) were found in human myeloid neoplasms and other tumors (5) but the significance of these mutations and their impacts on CBL function were studied only for very few mutants (7). The mechanistic aspects of CBL cancer mutations can now be adequately addressed as several CBL structures have become available which represent the snapshots of different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1). All CBL proteins share a highly conserved N-terminus which includes a tyrosine kinaseâ€“binding domain (TKBD)	 a linker helix region (LHR) and a RING finger domain	 while the C-terminus comprises a proline-rich region (8). The RING domain of CBL has E3 activity and ubiquitinates activated receptor tyrosine kinases which subsequently targets them for degradation (8). At the same time	 since CBL proteins can bind to activated receptor tyrosine kinases via the TKBD domain	 they can serve as adaptors by recruiting downstream signal transduction components such as SHP2 and P13K (9	 10).  Figure 1 Figure 1 CBL activation cycle. The structures representing the activation cycle of CBL are shown. In the inactive closed state (nCBL) the protein exists in the cytosol. Upon activation of the RTK	 CBL can bind to the phosphorylated RTK (orange peptide) via TKBD ... Another aspect of CBL function which should be accounted for in modeling the effects of cancer mutations is that it can bind to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) in complex with ubiquitin (Ub) and a substrate protein	 thereby facilitating the transfer of Ub from E2 to a lysine residue of the substrate (11). The crystal structure of the inactive complex of CBL with E2 (UbcH7) was solved more than ten years ago (12) while the active phosphorylated CBL-E2 (UbcH5B) complex was resolved fairly recently (13). According to the latter study	 substrate binding and Tyr371 phosphorylation activates CBL by producing a large conformational change in order to place the RING domain and E2 in close proximity to the substrate. It was further confirmed that phosphorylation-induced conformational change is required for positioning of ubiquitin for effective catalysis (14).  Here we present a new approach	 which aims to assess the effects of cancer mutations on stability	 binding and activity of cancer related proteins. We apply computational models to four different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1) and perform blind in vivo experiments of CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination. We show a rather remarkable agreement of experimental EGFR ubiquitination by CBL mutants with the computed changes in CBL thermodynamic stability and to a lesser extent with CBL-E2 binding affinity. The computational models not only quantitatively predict the magnitude of the effects of mutations but also shed light on the mechanisms of their action. Namely	 we find that cancer mutations have greater destabilizing effects on four CBL states than random non-cancer mutations for recurrent	 homozygous and leukemia mutations. Most damaging cancer mutations happen in the sites involved in Zn-coordination and in the formation of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds within CBL or between CBL and E2. Overall cancer driver mutations affect different or multiple stages of the CBL activation cycle either completely abolishing its E3 activity or partially attenuating it. The computational models based on stability and binding affinity calculations can discriminate experimentally validated driver from passenger mutations (with the exception of two mutations) and outperform several state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods aiming to predict phenotypic impacts of mutations.  Go to: Materials and Methods Computational modeling and analysis  Mapping of CBL mutations The COSMIC database (15) stores data on somatic cancer mutations and integrates the experimental data from full-genome sequencing studies. We extracted 103 missense mutations for the CBL gene from the COSMIC database (15) that could be mapped to four available CBL structures in its activation cycle (Fig. 1). Cancer mutations were classified into different classes according to the frequency of observed samples (single and recurrent mutations)	 zygosity (homo- and heterozygous mutations)	 types of cancer (leukemia and sarcoma) and the involvement of mutations in Zn-coordination (Table S1). In addition	 all possible single nucleotide substitutions resulting in amino-acid changes in the CBL gene were performed to obtain a â€œRandomâ€ missense mutation reference set. After excluding mutations observed in COSMIC and mutations occurring on residues without known coordinates in crystal structures	 we obtained 2	102 random missense mutations (Table S1). We also searched the dbSNP database (16) but found very few benign variations in the CBL gene. Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.  Model preparation We investigated the effects of mutations on four states of the CBL activation cycle: (1) closed CBL state (nCBL)	 (2) partially opened CBL state bound to substrate (CBL-S)	 (3) unphosphorylated autoinhibitory CBL bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and (4) phosphorylated CBL bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1). It was previously noted that both UbcH5B and UbcH7 can bind specifically to CBL but only UbcH5B can facilitate ubiquitination (17). The crystal structures of nCBL (PDB id: 2Y1M) (13)	 CBL-S (PDB id: 2Y1N) (13) and pCBL-E2-S (PDB id: 4A4C) (13) were obtained directly from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (18). Only one crystal structure of the unphosphorylated inactive state of CBL bound to E2 (UbcH7) and Zap-70 peptide (PDB id: 1FBV) (12) was available in PDB. Although sequence identity between UbcH7 and UbcH5B proteins is 38%	 the structural similarity is very high with the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.04 Ã…. The unphosphorylated autoinhibitory structure of CBL-UbcH5B-S was therefore modeled based on CBL-UbcH7-S (PDB id: 1FBV) using Chimera (19). (Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.)  Minimization procedure We applied our recently developed optimization protocol for minimizing wild-type and mutant structures (20). Heavy side chain atoms without known coordinates and hydrogen atoms were added to the crystal structures using the VMD (version 1.9.1) program (21) with models immersed into rectangular boxes of water molecules extending up to 10 Ã… from the protein in each direction. Wild-type protein complexes were minimized for 40	000 steps using explicit TIP3P water model. The final minimized models of wild-type protein complexes were used to produce all mutant structures and then an additional 300-step minimization for all mutant structures was performed. The energy minimization was carried out with the NAMD program (version 2.9) (22) using the CHARMM27 force field (23). For unfolding free energy calculations we applied the optimization procedure implemented in the RepairPDB module of the FoldX program (24) which optimizes the side chain configurations to provide a repaired structure. (See Supplementary Materials and Methods for more information.)  Binding and unfolding free energy calculations Binding free energy and effects of mutations on binding affinity were calculated according to the approach introduced by us earlier (20). Energy calculations were based on the modified MM-PBSA method that combined the molecular mechanics terms with the Poissonâ€“Boltzmann continuum representation of the solvent (25) and statistical scoring energy functions with parameters optimized on experimental sets of several thousand mutations (equation 3). Binding free energy calculations were performed on minimized wild-type and mutant structures of inactive CBL-E2-S and active pCBL-E2-S states. The binding energy is defined as a difference between the free energies of the complex and unbound proteins.  Î”Gbind=GCBL-E2-S-GCBL-S-GE2 (1) The change of binding energy due to a mutation can be calculated as:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î”Gbindmut-Î”GbindWT (2) The effect of mutations on binding affinity was calculated in this work using the following energy function:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î±Î”Î”Evdw+Î²Î”Î”Gsolv+Î³Î”SAmut+ÎµÎ”Î”GBM+Î»Î”Î”GFD+Î´ (3) Here Î”Î”Evdw is the change of the van der Waals interaction energy and Î”Î”Gsolv is the change of the polar solvation energy of solute in water. Î”SAmut represents a term proportional to the interface area of the mutant complex. Î”Î”GBM and Î”Î”GFD are the binding energy changes from BeAtMuSiC and FoldX	 respectively. BeAtMuSiC (26) estimates the effect of mutations on binding based on statistical potentials.  The FoldX software program (24) was used to estimate the unfolding free energy and to model the unfolding state. FoldX calculates the effects of mutations on protein stability using an empirical force field. The BuildModel module was used to introduce a mutation	 optimize the configurations of the neighboring side chains and calculate the difference in stability (unfolding free energy) between mutant ( Î”Gfoldmut) and repaired native structure ( Î”GfoldWT).  Î”Î”Gfold=Î”Gfoldmut-Î”GfoldWT (4) For comparison we used three alternative methods to predict the impacts of mutations on unfolding free energy: the Eris server (27)	 the Rosetta program (28) and the PoPMuSiC server (29). We also applied four additional webtools to assess the impacts of amino acid substitutions on CBL function: PROVEAN (30)	 PolyPhen-2 (31)	 MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). (See Supplementary Methods for more information.)  Go to: Experimental procedures Expression constructs  Human CBL cDNA was originally obtained from Wallace Langdon and subsequently cloned into the pCEFL expression plasmid (34). Point mutation constructs	 described above	 were created from wild-type CBL using the QuikChange II Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions (Stratagene	 La Jolla	 CA). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.  Cell culture and transfections  The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T	 the human nonsmall cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the human cervical cancer cell line HeLa used in this study were originally obtained from ATCC and maintained in culture using DMEM (Gibco	 Grand Island	 NY) supplemented with 10% FBS	 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin sulfate. Cell lines were authenticated by Short Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis by using either Promega Powerplex 16 (Promega	 Madison	 WI) or the AmpFISTR Identifier Kit (Life Technologies	 Carlsbad	 CA) and compared to the ATCC or DSMZ databases. HeLa cells were received in the lab in 2013 last authenticated on 7-30-15	 A549 were received in the lab in 2015 and last authenticated on 8-12-15	 and HEK293T were received in the lab in 1995 and last authenticated on 10-8-15.HEK293T cells were transfected using calcium phosphate according to the instructions accompanying the reagent (Profection; Promega Corp.	 Madison	 WI)	 incubated 18 h prior to media change and grown for a total of 48 h prior to harvesting. A549 and Hela cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen	 Carlsbad	 CA). Transfections were allowed to incubate 6 h prior to media change	 and cells were grown an additional 48 h before being harvested. Cells were starved for 4 hours and treated with EGF (100 ng/ul). Each cell-based experiment was repeated at least two times.  Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation  To harvest proteins	 cells were washed twice in ice-cold Dulbeccoâ€™s PBS-containing 200 Î¼M sodium orthovanadate (Fisher Chemicals	 Fairlawn	 NJ) then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5	 150 mM NaCl	 5 mM EDTA	 1% Triton X-100	 10% glycerol	 100 mM iodoacetamide [Sigma-Aldrich Corp.	 St. Louis	 MO]	 2 mM sodium orthovanadate	 and protease inhibitors [Complete tabsÂ®	 Roche Diagnostics Corp.	 Indianapolis	 IN]). All whole cell lysates were cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 16	000 Ã— g for 15 m at 4 Â°C. Supernatant protein concentrations were determined using the BioRad protein assay (BioRad	 Hercules	 CA). For immunoblotting	 20Î¼g of whole cell lysates were boiled in a 1:1 dilution of 2X loading buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8	 10% glycerol	 2% SDS	 1 mg/ml bromophenol blue	 0.3573 M Î²-mercaptoethanol) for 5 m. For immunoprecipitations	 150 Î¼g of each of the whole cell lysates were incubated with rabbit anti-EGFR (Ab-3; Millipore) and with Protein A/G+ agarose beads (sc-2003; Santa Cruz Biotechnology	 Santa Cruz	 CA). All immunoprecipitations were incubated overnight at 4Â°C with tumbling. Immune complexes were washed five times in 1 mL cold lysis buffer	 then resuspended in 2X loading buffer	 boiled for 5 m	 then resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran BA85; Whatman	 Sanford	 MA). For immunoblot detection of proteins	 the following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-EGFR (2232L; Cell Signaling)	 rat monoclonal high affinity anti-HA-peroxidase	 (clone 3F10; Roche)	 rabbit anti-Cbl (sc-C-15; Santa Cruz) and mouse anti-Hsc70 (sc-7298; Santa Cruz). Horseradish peroxidase linked donkey anti-rabbit IgG (NA934V; GE Healthcare	 Piscataway	 NJ)	 or donkey anti-mouse IgG (NA931: GE Healthcare	 Piscataway	 NJ) immunoglobulin was used with SuperSignal (Pierce Biotechnology Inc.	 Rockford	 IL) to visualize protein detection.  Densitometric Analysis  Immunoblots were developed on HyBlot CL Autoradiography Film (Denville Scientific Inc.	 South Plainfield	 NJ) with an X-OMAT automated processor (Eastman Kodak	 Rochester	 NY). Protein expression levels were then recorded using an Epson Perfection V750 PRO scanner (Epson Inc.	 Long Beach	 CA) and densitometric analysis was performed using Adobe Photoshop software version 7.0 (Adobe Systems Inc.	 U.S.A). EGFR ubiquitination signal intensity was determined by optical density in a set area normalized against the EGFR band intensity in parallel immunoblots and expressed as a densitometric ratio of ubiquitination/EGFR levels. The mean densitometric ratio of EGFR ubiquitination	 in the presence of each CBL mutation	 was then assessed relative to wild-type CBL where the ratio was set at 1.0.  Go to: Results Cancer mutations impact CBL stability  We estimated the thermodynamic stability (unfolding free energy) changes	 Î”Î”Gfold	 upon mutation for closed (nCBL) and partially opened (CBL-S) CBL states (Fig. 1). These states did not involve binding to E2. The examination of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for random non-cancer mutations (Fig. 2A) showed that it was very similar to experimental distributions produced by random mutagenesis on a set of different proteins (35	 36). Namely	 the distribution for random non-cancer mutations was asymmetrically centered at positive energy values and there were about 10% of random mutations with highly damaging effects on CBL structures by more than 5 kcal molâˆ’1 (Fig. 2A). Despite the presence of highly damaging random mutations	 recurrent cancer mutations overall produced significantly larger destabilizing effects compared to random (p-value â‰ª 0.01) for both nCBL and CBL-S states (Fig. 2A and S1	 Table S2). This was not the case for single cancer mutations observed in only one patient (Table S2). Overall	 the form of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for recurrent cancer mutations was different from the Î”Î”Gfold distribution of random mutations (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p-value â‰ª 0.01) whereas the distribution for single cancer mutations was indistinguishable from a random mutation distribution. However	 it does not mean that all single cancer mutants can be considered passenger	 as we show later	 this is not the case for some of them.  Figure 2 Figure 2 (A) The distribution of unfolding (Î”Î”Gfold) and binding (Î”Î”Gbind) free energy changes for Single	 Recurrent and Random class mutations on nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states (see SI for other states). Positive and negative values ... The top 25% cancer mutations with the largest damaging effects are presented in Table S3. Many of them occurred in Zn-coordinating sites while many others did not involve Zn-coordination sites. Some of these latter mutations (G415V	 G413R and G415S) introduced large Van der Waals clashes with neighboring residues which could not be accommodated by side chain rearrangements	 whereas other mutations (S376F	 Y371D and L405P) affected disulfide or hydrogen bonds. For example	 L405P located in the middle of an Î±-helix affected the CBL structure by introducing an energetically unfavorable kink in the helix due to its inability to donate an amide hydrogen bond.  Effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding  The outcome of mutations can be assessed by the extent of structural changes they induce. We calculated the local root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between the minimized wild-type and mutant structures around the mutated site. We found that the protein backbone in the vicinity of a mutation of the CBL-E2 complex underwent larger local conformational changes upon recurrent cancer mutations	 especially for mutations occurring in Zn-coordinating site clusters	 compared to random mutations (p-value â‰ª 0.01	 Fig. S2 and S3). In the previous section we analyzed the original closed (nCBL) state and partially opened (CBL-S) state induced by substrate binding. In this section we study the effects of cancer mutations on two other CBL states: an autoinhibitory CBL state bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and phosphorylated active CBL state bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1) (13). Effects of mutations on binding can be in general linked with their structural locations	 therefore we examined the locations of mutations and found that about one third of all cancer mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface (Fig. S4). This preference was found to be statistically significant (p-value â‰ª 0.01) (Fig. S4).  It was previously experimentally shown that binding between CBL and E2 was rather weak with a micromolar dissociation constant (13). Despite the fact that the interface between CBL and E2 in the inactive state is several residues larger than in the active state	 consistent with experiments	 we found somewhat stronger binding between CBL and E2 for the active state of CBL (Table S4). Similarly to the impacts of cancer mutations on stability	 recurrent (but not single) mutations destabilized CBL-E2 binding significantly (Fig. 2B	 S1 and Table S2). Importantly	 cancer mutations reduced the CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state (p-value = 0.002) (Fig. 2B) and the effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding of the active state were noticeably larger compared to random mutations even if we excluded mutations in Zn-coordinating sites (Table S2). This latter observation does not hold true for the autoinhibitory CBL-E2-S conformation.  Next	 all cancer mutations were ranked with respect to their effects on CBL-E2 binding. About half of all highly damaging mutations (top 25% of most damaging mutations	 Table S3) impacted both stability and CBL-E2 binding for all four CBL states. Among them	 several mutations occurred in Zn-coordinating clusters and M400 and L405 sites. Another class of mutations (involving W408 and R420 sites) mostly influenced CBL-E2 binding. For example	 the W408S mutation caused the largest perturbation in CBL-E2 binding of the active state by decreasing binding affinity up to 3.5 kcal molâˆ’1 but having a moderate effect on stability of the nCBL and CBL-S states. It was previously suggested that amino acids in positions W408 and I383 constituted specificity of CBL-E2 binding and corresponded to binding hot spots (10	 12). Mutations in the I383 site are not recorded in the COSMIC database although they have a profound destabilizing effect on CBL-E2 binding for both states (see data for random mutations on the ftp site ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/panch/CBL). Another site affecting binding of CBL (R420) is a highly conserved site in the CBL family	 it strongly interacts with the Q92	 W93 and S94 residues of E2. It was previously experimentally verified that mutations in this site disrupted the CBL activity and could be associated with cytokine-independent growth (37). There are 24 cancer patient samples where mutations of this site (R420Q	 R420L and R420P) are found and they all produce strong destabilizing effects on the active pCBL-E2-S state.  According to the zygosity annotation	 there are 49 heterozygous (â€œHeteroâ€) and 27 homozygous (â€œHomoâ€) mutations (Table S1) and for the rest of cancer mutations their zygocity status is undetermined. Overall	 we found that destabilizing mutations were enriched among homozygous compared to heterozygous mutations for all stages of CBL activation cycle (p-value = 0.021 â€“ 0.035) and were more prevalent in leukemia compared to sarcoma patients (p-value = 0.000 â€“ 0.003) (Fig. 2B	 Table S2). This observation could not be attributed to the prevalence of homozygous mutations in Zn-coordinating clusters since these clusters had almost equal numbers of heterozygous and homozygous mutations. It was reported earlier that many homozygous mutations could be connected to uniparental disomy when germline heterozygosity would lead to neoplasia upon reduction to homozygosity (6	38	 39). If some patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms had germline heterozygous mutations in CBL	 then lost the wild-type CBL allele and duplicated mutant allele	 it would be possible that the damaging mutant allele would be duplicated in a cancer cell with a higher probability. Indeed	 human leukemia samples show the loss of the normal CBL allele.  CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination: comparing experiments with computational models  Next we randomly picked fifteen cancer mutations based on their predicted damaging status	 trying to equally sample highly damaging and benign mutations irrespective to their frequencies in cancer samples	 and experimentally tested the E3 activity of wild-type and mutant CBL proteins (see Methods	 Table 1). As can be seen in Fig. 3A	 in the presence of wild-type CBL	 activation of the EGFR induced more than a 10-fold increase in the ubiquitination of the EGFR compared to empty vector (endogenous CBL levels) in HEK293T cells (compare lane 4 to lane 2 in top panel of Fig. 3A). The E3 activity of wild-type CBL was mirrored by a decrease in the levels of immunoprecipitated EGFR consistent with the targeting of ubiquitinated EGFR for degradation (compare lanes 2 and 4 in second panel of Fig. 3A).  Figure 3 Figure 3 (A) EGFR ubiquitination. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant CBL proteins along with the EGFR and hemagglutinin (HA)-epitope tagged ubiquitin. The vector control and wild-type	 CBL transfectant cells were incubated ... Table 1 Table 1 Experimental relative densitometry values for HEK293T cells	 predicted changes in stability (Î”Î”Gfold kcal molâˆ’1)	 binding affinity (Î”Î”Gbind kcal molâˆ’1) and comparison with other methods for 15 experimentally ... We classified all mutations into three groups (damaging	 attenuating and benign) according to their experimental relative densitometry data and compared experimental data with the estimates produced by the computational models. The first group of damaging mutants included C396R	 H398Q	 Y371H	 K382E and C381A which completely abolished CBL activity (relative densitometry was less than 10%) (Fig. 3B) and the levels of total EGFR were not decreased by these mutants (Fig. 3A). Only two of these mutants belonged to the Recurrent class of mutations. Table 1 shows predicted and experimentally verified effects of mutations on all four CBL states. All five mutants were predicted to be damaging by stability and binding affinity calculations but the mechanisms of their action were different. C396R	 H398Q and C381A mutations disrupted Zn-coordinating clusters and had very damaging consequences according to the stability model for both nCBL and CBL-S states and damaging effects on CBL-E2 binding even though none of these mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface. On the other hand	 the K382E mutation did not affect Zn-coordination but destabilized the nCBL state. This	 in turn	 could be explained by the charge substitution that led to the disruption of the K382-E373 salt bridge within the closed state of nCBL (Figure 4 and Figure S5A). Moreover	 K382E mutation had a significant impact on CBL-E2 binding due to the disruption of a salt bridge between pY371 and K382 affecting the stability of CBL in the active state (Figure 4 and Figure S5D). No significant changes were observed for CBL-S and CBL-E2-S states (Figure S5B	C). K382E mutation was previously observed in Noonan syndrome and was speculated to affect CBL stability or binding (40). Finally	 the Y371H mutation not only abolished phosphorylation at the Y371 site but also had a profound destabilizing effect on all four states as evident from Table 1.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Structures of wild type (green) and K382E mutant (tan) are shown for nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states. Salt bridges are shown as dashed lines and in both cases mutation affects the stability by disrupting the salt bridge. The second group of mutants (M374V	 V430M	 P428L	 Q249E and double mutant S80N/H94Y) maintained the CBL activity equivalent to or greater than wild-type CBL (relative densitometry of 80% or higher) (Fig. 3B). Consistent with this	 the levels of the activated EGFR were also decreased in these samples (Fig. 3A). To confirm that the retained E3 activity of these mutants was not cell type specific	 we transfected these mutants into the non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the cervical cancer cell line Hela (Fig. S6). The S80N/H94Y and Q249E mutations were previously identified in human non-small cell lung cancers making the A549 cell line a relevant cell type to investigate the function of these CBL mutants while other cancer mutations were found in other cancer types. As in the HEK293T cells	 transfection of wild-type CBL into A549 and HeLa cells resulted in a significant increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of EGFR compared to the cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. S6). The increase in transfected CBL protein compared to endogenous CBL protein was less in HeLa than in either the A549 or HEK293T cells. Consistent with this	 the fold increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of the EGFR by wild-type CBL was smaller in Hela cells (about three fold) compared to either A549 or HEK293T cells (more than 10 fold in each). As in HEK293T cells	 the Y371H mutant did not stimulate ubiquitination compared to the vector transfected control for A549 or HeLa cells (Fig. S6A and C). The CBL mutants that were fully active in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3A and B) maintained CBL E3 activity in A549 and HeLa cells (Fig. S6). Two of these CBL mutants resulted in more ubiquitination of EGFR compared to wild type CBL. For example	 the Q249E mutant showed an increased ubiquitination of EGFR in 293T and HeLa cells while the M374V mutant resulted in higher ubiquitination levels in A549 and HeLa cells (Figure 3 and S6). Only V430M mutant was on the borderline with the densitometry ratio of 0.8. All mutations from the second group were predicted to be benign according to our computational models	 whereas V430M	 consistent with experimental data	 had a borderline destabilizing impact on CBL-E2 binding (Table 1).  Finally	 the third group constituted mutations (L399V	 G375P	 P395A and V391I) which attenuated the CBL E3 activity according to the relative densitometry data (Fig. 3B). Only one of these mutants was observed in two cancer samples while other three belonged to the Single mutation class. Concordant with this	 there were intermediate levels of EGFR (Fig. 3A). G375P and P395A mutations were predicted to have partially damaging effects while V391I and L399V were classified as benign in our predictions. Interestingly	 mutations from this third group affected only some of the CBL states. In contrast	 the highly damaging mutations from the first group had damaging impacts on almost all CBL states.  Next we tested if the reduction in CBL ubiquitination activity was directly correlated with the effects of mutations on stability (Fig. 5A). The relationship between experimental densitometry data and Î”Î”Gfold was better described by an exponential dependence with correlation coefficient (R) of 0.77 and 0.78 for CBL-S and nCBL states respectively (Table S5). Indeed	 the change in absorption between wild-type and mutant proteins which refers to a fraction of active mutants can be described by the Boltzmann equation relating the probability of a state with the energy of this state. A mutation may lead to damaging effects and a loss of function if it impacts at least one of the CBL functional states. Taking this into consideration we calculated the correlation between densitometry and stability changes taking a maximum of Î”Î”Gfold values for the nCBL and CBL-S states. As shown in Fig. 5A and Table S5	 changes in stability can indeed explain the effects of mutations on CBL ubiquitination activity with high correlation of R = 0.83. For comparison	 several alternative methods were applied to predict the effect of mutations on unfolding free energy	 they all reported correlation coefficients ranging from 0.21 to 0.52	 with only one method PopMusic reporting a statistically significant correlation of 0.52 (Table S5). The relationship between densitometry and binding affinity changes was on the borderline of significance with a linear correlation coefficient of 0.48 and 0.62 (if two highly damaging mutations were excluded) (Fig. 5B and Table S5).  Figure 5 Figure 5 (A) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (exponential model) and maximal predicted changes in stability. (B) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (linear model) and predicted changes in binding affinity of pCBL-E2-S state. ... There are various methods which predict the phenotypic effects of mutations	 (30â€“33	 41) and some of them use structural features (31	 41). We applied four state-of-the-art independent methods to predict the impacts of mutations on CBL function: PROVEAN (30)	 PolyPhen-2 (31)	 MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). Some of these methods outperformed our model in classifying cancer from random mutations since they were trained to distinguish disease from neutral variants (Table S6). However	 all four methods had a very limited accuracy in classifying CBL cancer mutations into those that disrupted function and those that did not. As evident from Table 1 and Table S5	 all methods except for PROVEAN over-predicted damaging effects of experimentally tested mutations while PROVEAN was the only method which produced a significant correlation between the densitometry data and PROVEANâ€™s score (R=0.58	 Table S5).  Go to: Discussion Stability-activity balance in cancer related proteins  Evolutionary selection to maintain structural	 foldable and functional proteins eliminates many mutations in protein sequences. On the other hand	 thermodynamic stability can be compromised in evolution to ensure certain arrangements of catalytic and binding sites	 which might not be energetically optimal (36	 42). In tumorigenesis	 protein stability or binding may be reduced (or in some cases increased) due to cancer mutations. As a consequence it can lead to decreased fitness at the protein level	 but may confer a fitness advantage for the population of tumor cells (43	 44). However	 the extent of the stability-activity tradeoff in oncogenes and tumor suppressors remains largely unknown. Using the example of the CBL protein	 here we tried to elucidate the stability-activity balance and to understand whether the loss or gain of activity in cancer-related proteins can be accompanied by compromised stability or binding.  In contrast to many other computational studies	 which attempt to link stability with activity by mostly focusing on one protein conformation	 we performed an analysis on four different stages of the CBL activation cycle. Our predictions of changes in stability and binding were further elucidated by the experimental CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays. We found a strong relationship between the effects of mutations on CBL stability and experimentally obtained densitometry data (quantifying activity)	 while a relatively weaker correlation was observed between changes in densitometry and CBL-E2 binding affinity. It could be explained either by a less significant impact of experimentally tested mutations on CBL-E2 binding or by a limited coupling (compared to CBL stability) between CBL-E2 binding and E3 activity.  Drivers or passengers?  According to our study	 about two thirds of all experimentally tested mutations either completely abolished or attenuated E3 activity	 while one third of them were neutral. Trying to assess the limitations of our models	 we applied state-of- the-art methods commonly used to predict functional effects of mutations. However	 these methods failed to distinguish inactivating from neutral mutations as accurately as the computational models which were solely based on accounting for the effects on stability and binding for different CBL states. Indeed	 many methods are not specifically designed to discriminate driver from passenger mutations within the pool of cancer mutations	 but rather they perform a task of distinguishing cancer from neutral mutations.  Certainly	 the large majority of all mutations detected in cancer genomics studies are likely to be neutral although the collective burden of passenger mutations may also alter the course of tumorigenesis (45). When we analyzed the distribution of all single cancer missense mutations observed in the CBL gene	 their average effects on stability or binding were not found to be significantly different from the pool of random mutations. These mutations either mostly constitute true passenger mutations or their oncogenic mechanisms are not directly connected to protein destabilization. The story is quite the opposite for the recurrent mutations as they have on average significantly higher destabilizing effects than random mutations and the majority of them should be drivers. An interesting group of mutations includes those which are highly damaging but found only in one cancer sample (10% of all single cancer mutations). These mutations may represent either rare driver or latent driver mutations (46). Several of these mutations were experimentally tested and are listed in Table 1.  CBL-E2 binding in deciphering the mechanisms of cancer  Our analysis showed that cancer mutations reduce CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state. It is in contrast to the stability-activity tradeoff reported for EGFR and other cancer related proteins (47)	 where cancer mutations may disrupt autoinhibitory interactions and activate the kinase (48	 49). Importantly	 all mutations with experimentally tested high inactivating effects have impacts on both CBL stability and CBL-E2 binding (Table 1). In fact	 the correlation between Î”Î”Gfold and Î”Î”Gbind for CBL cancer mutations from COSMIC is positive (R = 0.20 â€“ 0.48 depending on the CBL state	 p-value < 0.05). It might seem counterintuitive as some residues maintain stability by sustaining the RING-TKBD autoinhibitory interactions within CBL. This interface overlaps with the CBL-E2 interface and competes against E2 binding (13). One might think that disruption of RING-TKBD interactions and destabilization of CBL might facilitate binding to E2 and therefore lead to CBL activation. A slight activation was actually observed for two mutants	 one of which (M374V) was directly located on the CBL-E2 interface. However	 as we showed through the positive high correlation between stability and activity changes	 this mechanism is rarely observed and the vast majority of mutations disrupt CBL-E3 activity by either destabilizing CBL and/or CBL-E2 binding or by directly affecting phosphorylation of the critical tyrosine Y371.  Overall	 our results support the idea that decrease of E3 activity	 of the ability to ubiquitinate receptor tyrosine kinases	 of CBL stability and/or CBL-E2 binding can give a selective advantage for tumor cells. However	 there are several factors that complicate deciphering the mechanisms of action of CBL cancer mutations. CBL mutations can be dominant-negative and mutated CBL might not only change the CBL E3 activity but also might affect the concentration and activity of the wild-type CBL. According to a ratiometric method to identify driver genes in cancer (1)	 CBL can be regarded as an oncogene since it has several mutation hot spots. On the other hand	 as shown in our study and in other studies	 cancer driver mutations can inactivate the E3 activity of CBL	 so it can also be regarded as a tumor suppressor. Although the latter fact complicates the development of CBL targeted therapies	 understanding the delicate balance among different CBL-affected pathways may facilitate the indirect drug targeting of damaged CBL proteins. The current genetics-based frameworks to analyze cancer genome-wide sequence data are necessary but not sufficient for understanding the processes of carcinogenesis and developing informed	 targeted therapies. Our approach	 which can be applied in general to different proteins of interest	 emphasizes the importance of the physics of binding and protein conformational ensembles in deducing the mechanisms of cancer.  																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			
4	23||Recent evidence has demonstrated that acquired uniparental disomy (aUPD) is a novel mechanism by which pathogenetic mutations in cancer may be reduced to homozygosity. To help identify novel mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs)	 we performed a genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) screen to identify aUPD in 58 patients with atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML; n = 30)	 JAK2 mutationâ€“negative myelofibrosis (MF; n = 18)	 or JAK2 mutationâ€“negative polycythemia vera (PV; n = 10). Stretches of homozygous	 copy neutral SNP calls greater than 20Mb were seen in 10 (33%) aCML and 1 (6%) MF	 but were absent in PV. In total	 7 different chromosomes were involved with 7q and 11q each affected in 10% of aCML cases. CBL mutations were identified in all 3 cases with 11q aUPD and analysis of 574 additional MPNs revealed a total of 27 CBL variants in 26 patients with aCML	 myelofibrosis or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Most variants were missense substitutions in the RING or linker domains that abrogated CBL ubiquitin ligase activity and conferred a proliferative advantage to 32D cells overexpressing FLT3. We conclude that acquired	 transforming CBL mutations are a novel and widespread pathogenetic abnormality in morphologically related	 clinically aggressive MPNs.  Introduction  Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by overproliferation of one or more myeloid cell lineages in the bone marrow and increased numbers of mature and immature myeloid cells in the peripheral blood. Excess proliferation is frequently associated with splenomegaly and cardiovascular complications as well as increased risk of transformation to acute leukemia. MPNs are categorized into subtypes based on specific morphologic	 hematologic	 and laboratory parameters	 the best characterized being the 4 so-called classic MPNs: polycythemia vera (PV)	 essential thrombocythemia (ET)	 primary myelofibrosis (MF)	 and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).1 In addition	 several atypical MPNs are recognized	 some of which show both dysplastic and proliferative features	 such as atypical	 BCR-ABL negative CML (aCML).2  MPNs are associated with acquired	 activating mutations or gene fusions of tyrosine kinases	 abnormalities that are believed to be critical drivers of excess proliferation as a result of deregulated or constitutive signaling.3 The 2 most prominent examples are BCR-ABL in CML4 and the V617F JAK2 mutation in PV	 ET	 and MF	5â‡“â‡“â€“8 but more than 40 variant tyrosine kinase fusions have been identified in MPNs as well as other mutations in JAK2 and FLT3.2 Activating mutations have been described in components that signal upstream (eg	 MPL) or downstream (eg	 NRAS) of tyrosine kinases9	10; however	 the molecular pathogenesis of the majority of atypical MPNs and approximately 50% of ET and MF cases remains obscure.  V617F JAK2 was initially identified by several different routes	 one of which was based on the observation that many PV patients show evidence of acquired uniparental disomy (aUPD) at chromosome 9p.11	12 Regions of aUPD exhibit loss of heterozygosity (LOH) compared with constitutional DNA without change of copy number and arise by mitotic recombination followed by selection for one of the products. After the initial observations in PV	 it has emerged that aUPD is common in both hematologic and epithelial malignancies	 and is associated with known oncogenic changes in a variety of genes within the affected regions.13 In this study we set out to determine whether aUPD characterizes MPNs of unknown molecular etiology and	 if so	 whether it could be used as a tool to help identify novel driver mutations.  Methods  Patients  Peripheral blood or bone marrow samples were received from patients diagnosed with an MPN or other hematologic malignancy according to standard morphologic	 hematologic	 and laboratory criteria. Clinical data were available from a subset of these cases. The study was approved by the Internal Review Boards from participating institutions and informed consent was obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.  SNP array analysis  DNA labeling and hybridization to Affymetrix 50k XbaI chips was performed at the Deutsches Ressourcenzentrum fÃ¼r Genomforschung (RZPD	 Berlin	 Germany). Raw data were imported into the Affymetrix GeneChip Operating Software	 analyzed using Affymetrix (High Wycombe	 United Kingdom) GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE 4.1) and copy number analysis tool (CNAT). Data were exported to custom-designed spreadsheets that display loss of heterozygosity and copy number changes in ideogram format. Data were also analyzed using Affymetrix Genotyping Console (version 2.1). Overall	 a median of 98.2% (range	 91.5%-99.6%) of SNPs gave readable calls.  Mutation analysis  Detection of mutations by high resolution melting (HRM) analysis was performed as described14 using a Rotor-Gene 6000 (Corbett Life Sciences	 St Neots	 United Kingdom). Direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products was performed by standard techniques on an ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems	 Warrington	 United Kingdom) and analyzed using Mutation Surveyor (SoftGenetics	 State College	 PA). CBL mutations are numbered relative to the ATG (A = 1) in the Ensembl cDNA sequence ENSG00000110395. A dropping factor (relative intensity drop of the wild-type allele peak relative to that seen in a concurrently run normal sample) of 60% or more was considered indicative of a biallelic mutation whereas a dropping factor of less than 60% was considered as monoallelic. Primer sequences for CBL exon 8 were CBL_i7f (5â€²-tgtggtttcactttaaaccctgga-3â€²) and CBL_i8r (5â€²-gccaggccaccccttgtatc-3â€²) and for CBL exon 9 were CBL_i8f (5â€²-ggcctggcttttgggttagg-3â€²) and CBL_i9r (5â€²-cacaatggattttgccagtctcc-3â€²). CBL reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) was performed on random hexamerâ€“reverse transcribed RNA using primers CBLe7F: 5â€²-gaatcctgatctgactggcttatg-3â€² and CBLe10R 5â€²-gctgcggcagaaggtcaagt-3â€². Other primer sequences are available on request.  Microsatellite analysis  DNA samples were amplified with a series of fluorescently labeled primer pairs flanking highly polymorphic microsatellite markers on chromosome 11q as described.10 aUPD was scored if 4 or more consecutive markers encompassing CBL were homozygous without change in allelic copy number (P < .05 of this occurring in the absence of aUPD based on published rates of heterozygosity). Copy number at 11q was estimated by multiplex ligation probe amplification (MLPA) using the Marfan probeset 1 (P065; MRC Holland	 Amsterdam	 The Netherlands)	 a kit that contains four 11q control probes including one at 11q23.3.  Constructs  pMY-wtCBL and pMY-CBLR420Q express wild-type and R420Q CBL	 respectively	 along with green fluorescent protein (GFP).15 Other CBL mutant constructs were derived from pMY-wtCBL using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene	 La Jolla	 CA). pAL/FLT3 and pCMVâ€“HA ubiquitin have also been described previously.15  Cell lines  The IL-3â€“dependent murine myeloid cell 32Dcl3 (32D) was purchased from the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (Braunschweig	 Germany) and was maintained in 90% RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10% WEHI-3B conditioned medium (WEHI). All cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37Â°C and 5% carbon dioxide. 32D cells were stably transduced by electroporation with wt-FLT3 in a pAL vector as previously described16 and maintained in 15 ng/mL blastocidin (Invitrogen	 Paisley United Kingdom). The Platinum-E (Plat-E) retrovirus packaging cell line17 was transfected using the calcium phosphate method with 5 Î¼g CBL construct DNA: 106 32D/wtFLT3 cells were cocultivated with the Plat-E cells for 48 hours in a volume of 2 mL (50% RPMI	 50% DMEM	 10% FBS	 5% WEHI). GFP positive cells were flow sorted to highest possible purity using a BD FACSAria cell sorter (Becton Dickinson	 Stanford	 CA). If insufficient cells were obtained for experiments after flow sorting	 the cells were maintained in culture and resorted to greater than 95% purity.  Growth factor withdrawal assays  Cell growth was compared with wt-FLT3	 vector-only transfected cells and the parental 32D line in stably transfected cells. Cells (105/mL) were grown over 3 days in triplicate for each CBL mutant and a wt-CBL control in 96-well plates. Cultures were analyzed daily for proliferation using the Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit (MTS assay; Promega	 Southampton	 United Kingdom). All experiments were performed at least 3 times independently and results were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 4 software (GraphPad Software	 San Diego	 CA).  Ubiquitin ligase activity  The ubiquitin ligase activity of CBL mutants in comparison to wild-type CBL was determined by transiently transfecting 107 32D/wtFLT3 cells expressing wild-type or CBL mutants by electroporation with 20 Î¼g pCMV-HA ubiquitin. Cells were maintained in culture with WEHI for 12 hours after transfection before being washed	 serum deprived overnight	 exposed to FLT3 ligand for 10 minutes	 and lysed in buffer as described.18 Lysates were incubated with a FLT3-specific polyclonal antibody overnight at 4Â°C. Protein G agarose beads (100 Î¼L) were added and incubated at 4Â°C for 4 hours. The beads were washed 4 times in ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer. The supernatant was mixed with sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) sample loading buffer before immunoblot analyses with antibodies against HA-ubiquitin (sc-805; Santa Cruz Biotechnology	 Santa Cruz	 CA)	 CBL (2111C3a; Abcam	 Cambridge	 United Kingdom)	 and FLT3 (sc-479; Cell Signaling Technology	 Danvers	 MA).  Results  SNP array analysis  We performed genome-wide SNP analysis on leukocyte DNA extracted from 58 MPD patients: aCML (n = 30)	 V617F JAK2 negative MF (n = 18)	 and JAK2 mutation negative PV/idiopathic erythrocytosis (n = 10). As comparators	 we also analyzed cases of CML in transformation to blast crisis (n = 30	 of which 20 were myeloid and 10 lymphoid) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; n = 20). We conservatively defined likely regions of aUPD as at least 20 Mb of absent or significantly reduced heterozygous SNP calls (ie	 < 5% SNPs called as heterozygous) running to a telomere without change in copy number (Figure 1A). Such large regions are uncommon in healthy individuals.19 Strikingly	 we found that aUPD was common in aCML with 10 (33%) of cases affected. In contrast	 aUPD was only seen in a single case of MF and was not seen in other patient subgroups. In total	 7 different chromosomes were affected	 with abnormalities at 7q and 11q each seen recurrently in 10% of aCML cases. The affected regions ranged in size from 29 Mb to a complete copy of chromosome 13 (Table 1).

(A) Array analysis of 2 control patients showing copy number (CN) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) outputs. The x-axis for the CN plots show (copy number)âˆ’2 as determined by CNAT	 with values approaching or exceeding âˆ’1 indicating deletions and greater than +1 indicating amplifications. The x-axis for LOH shows log10 P values (ie	 20 indicates 10âˆ’20). The 2 panels on the left are from a polycythemia vera (PV) case with a homozygous V617F JAK2 mutation. There is no gross copy number change (individual datapoints spread around the zero line)	 but a large block of homozygous SNP calls at 9p indicative of aUPD. The 2 panels on the right are from a chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) blast crisis case and show LOH accompanied by a 20q deletion. (B) For case UPN 5	 a large block of 11q aUPD is apparent on analysis of granulocytes but almost completely absent from mononuclear cells (MNCs) extracted from the same sample. (C) Chromosome 1p aUPD in case UPN 27 is associated with a biallelic G>T MPL mutation that is predicted to result in a W515L substitution. (D) Whole chromosome 13 isodisomy in case UPN 28 associated with a homozygous FLT3 ITD. Two controls are shown: an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient previously known to have a heterozygous FLT3 ITD and a healthy individual. View inlineView popup Table 1 Chromosomal regions and cases affected by aUPD Association between aUPD and known acquired oncogenic mutations  Although we did not have constitutional DNA to formally confirm that the regions of homozygosity were acquired	 in 1 individual we found a marked reduction in the proportion of 11q aUPD positive cells on comparison of mononuclear cells and granulocytes	 consistent with an acquired abnormality (Figure 1B). Some of the affected regions harbor genes known to be relevant to hematologic malignancies and therefore we assessed their mutational status. Sequencing of the MPL gene in the case UPN 27 with 1p aUPD revealed a homozygous G>T change (Figure 1C) that results in the previously reported W515L substitution.9 Case UPN 28 with whole chromosome 13 UPD had a homozygous FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD; Figure 1D). Candidate genes for the abnormalities at 17q and 21q include NF1 and RUNX1	 respectively; however	 these were not investigated.  11q aUPD is associated with CBL mutations  Next	 we focused our analysis on the 2 recurrent regions of aUPD at 7q and 11q. Because of the strong association between MPNs and aberrant tyrosine kinase signaling	 we analyzed genes encoding tyrosine kinases and associated signaling components. The minimally affected region at chromosome 7q contains 3 tyrosine kinases: MET	 EPHA1	 and EPHB6. We fully sequenced the coding exons of these genes in the 3 cases with 7q aUPD and 2 normal controls but found no abnormalities. Similarly	 we found no sequence changes in exons 11 through 17 of BRAF	 a gene encoding a downstream component of RAS signaling that is mutated in malignant melanoma and other cancers.20 There are no tyrosine kinase genes on chromosome 11q	 and although there are several genes encoding signal transduction components	 CBL stood out as a known oncogene that negatively regulates tyrosine kinase signaling.21 Sequencing of CBL in the three 11q aUPD cases revealed that UPN 2 and UPN 5 each had a T>C change at nucleotide 1277 in exon 8 that predicts a L380P substitution. Case UPN 3 had a C>G missense change in exon 9 at nucleotide 1387 that predicts a P417A change (Figure 2). Consistent with the array results	 the mutations in cases UPN 3 and UPN 5 were predominant with the residual wild-type alleles only weakly visible. For case UPN 2 both the mutation and level of aUPD was less prominent	 presumably due to a greater background of normal cells.

Prevalence and nature of CBL mutations  To determine the prevalence of CBL mutations	 we sequenced exons 8 and 9 (that encode amino acids 366 through 409 and 410 through 477	 respectively) in an additional 574 MPN cases. A total of 27 sequence variants were identified in 26 patients	 of whom 3 had MF	 10 had chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML)	 12 had aCML and 1 had hypereosinophilic syndrome/chronic eosinophilic leukemia (HES/CEL; Tables 2 and 3). To ensure that we were not missing mutations elsewhere in the gene we analyzed all coding exons in 70 CBL mutation negative aCML or unclassified	 CML-like MPN cases by high resolution melt (HRM) analysis but failed to detect any further sequence changes apart from known polymorphisms. Similarly	 no mutations in CBLB exons 9 or 10 or CBLC exons 7 and 8 (the exons that correspond to CBL exons 8 and 9) were identified. The activity of BCR-ABL is known to increase during progression of CML from chronic phase to blast crisis22 and we speculated that abrogation of CBL activity might be at least partially responsible for this increase. HRM analysis of CBL exons 8 and 9 in blast crisis cases (n = 31)	 however	 failed to reveal any mutations.  View inlineView popup Table 2 Cases analyzed for CBL mutations View inlineView popup Table 3 List of CBL sequence variants Of the 27 CBL variants	 21 (78%) were missense substitutions affecting 12 amino acids (15 different substitutions)	 5 (19%) were candidate splicing abnormalities	 and 1 (3%) produced a stop codon (Table 3). Most of the changes were novel	 although 4 cases had R420Q as previously identified in a single case of AML.15 Apart from N454D	 all residues affected by missense mutations were completely conserved in CBL orthologues as well as the 2 other human CBL family members (Figure 3). The mutation to a stop codon was found in a patient (UPN 9) who also had the Y371H variant; PCR across the affected regions and sequencing indicated that the 2 changes were on different alleles.

Residues affected by missense mutations found in this study are indicated by â–¼. CBL mutations are acquired and rarely seen in conjunction with other known mutations  For 2 cases (UPN 5 and UPN 14) we were able to compare the mutational status of leukocytes and T cells or buccal epithelia cells. In both cases the L380P mutation was only present in leukocytes and was therefore acquired (Figure 4A). A third case (UPN 15) originally presented with V617F JAK2 negative ET in 1989 but progressed to MF in 2004. Analysis of DNA extracted from sequential bone marrow slides indicated that the R420Q mutation was absent at the ET phase but acquired on transformation (Figure 4B). The 3 CBL-positive MF cases tested negative for MPL 515 mutations and all CBL mutation positive cases were negative for cytogenetic indicators of tyrosine kinase fusions	 FLT3 ITD	 activating NRAS mutations and V617F JAK2	 with the exception of 1 case (UPN 14) with MF who tested positive for both L380P CBL and V617F JAK2. Analysis of retrospective bone marrow slides for this case indicated the presence of V617F JAK2 at low level initially but absence of L380P CBL. The CBL mutation was detectable 7 years later and completely displaced V617F after a further 3 years	 corresponding with a significant rise is peripheral leukocyte counts (Figure 4C). A further case (UPN 21) presented with systemic mastocytosis before evolving to CBL mutation-positive CMML but retrospective samples were unavailable.

The JAK2 V617F mutation	 which had been present at low level since diagnosis	 was still detectable when CBL L380P first appeared but was undetectable in the 2008 sample	 when the CBL mutated clone predominated (* on sequence trace). (D) RT-PCR analysis. All cases and controls show the expected product from CBL exons 7-10. Cases UPN 18 and UPN 20 show smaller bands that result from complete deletion of exon 8. Splicing abnormalities  RNA was available for 3 of the 5 cases with potential splicing mutations. Patients UPN 18 and UPN 20 both exhibited double bands by RT-PCR	 sequencing of which showed one to be the normal product and the smaller band to result from the complete deletion of exon 8 in each case (Figure 4D)	 similar to that described in the cell line MOLM-13.23 Patient UPN 19 showed a single band by RT-PCR that was entirely normal on sequence analysis indicating that the exon 8+4 C>T change does not alter splicing. It seems likely	 therefore	 that the variant identified in case UPN 6 is also of no consequence. The pathogenicity of the intronic variant seen in case UPN 13 remains unknown.  The association between CBL mutations and UPD  To examine the association between CBL mutations and aUPD in more detail we performed microsatellite analysis on all mutated cases using 9 polymorphic markers spanning chromosome 11q13-qter. Of the 26 cases	 11 displayed patterns that indicated significant tracts of homozygosity	 including all 3 with 11q aUPD detected by SNP arrays. Case UPN 9 with 2 mutations was heterozygous for all markers. Of the 11 cases with biallelic CBL mutations as judged by sequence analysis	 5 showed complete homozygosity at all microsatellite loci tested and 6 had at least 4 consecutive homozygous calls encompassing the location of the CBL gene at 11q23.3 (Figure 5). We performed multiplex ligation probe amplification (MLPA) analysis to determine whether the observed homozygosity was a consequence of a deletion but no copy number changes were detected (data not shown) and therefore it is likely that homozygosity arose by aUPD. The number of mutated alleles estimated by sequencing was concordant with the microsatellite analysis in 20 cases (Figure 5). Of those that were discordant	 UPN 6 and UPN 25 had significant tracts of 11q homozygosity but had a monoallelic CBL mutation whereas UPN 10 and UPN 16 did not show 11q homozygosity but had clear biallelic CBL mutations. The reason for these discrepant cases is unclear	 but it is possible that the aUPD seen in UPN 6 and UPN 25 targeted another gene at 11q before acquisition of the CBL mutation. Homozygosity for the CBL mutations in the absence of 11q aUPD in UPN 10 and UPN 16 might be explained by a subcytogenetic deletion of 1 allele.  Figure 5 Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpoint Figure 5 Microsatellite analysis of CBL mutation positive cases. The number of CBL mutated alleles (1 monoallelic; 2 biallelic) was estimated by sequence analysis as described in â€œExperimental procedures.â€ Microsatellites were scored as homozygous (Embedded Image) or heterozygous (â–¡) for each case and their positions on chromosome 11q are indicated. Correlation between CBL mutations and clinical features  We compared clinical and hematologic features in patients with or without CBL mutations	 restricting the analysis to cases with aCML	 MF and CMML because these were the subgroups in which CBL mutations were most commonly found. Patients with CBL mutations had a shorter overall survival and progression-free survival compared with mutation negative cases (overall survival: 33 months vs 39 months; progression-free survival: 22 months vs 32 months) but the differences were not significant (Figure 6). Similarly there was no significant difference in gender distribution	 age and standard hematologic parameters between mutation positive and mutation negative cases and no differences emerged when individual disease entities were considered.

Overall survival (A) and progression-free survival (B) for atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML)	 chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML)	 and MF cases with (n = 19) or without (n = 87) CBL mutations. The differences between mutation positive and negative cases was not significant as determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Transforming activities of CBL mutants  We determined whether selected CBL variants had oncogenic activity by testing whether they could transform the interleukin-3 (IL-3)â€“dependent cell line 32D to growth factor independence in conjunction with overexpression of wild-type FLT3	 as has been described previously for R420Q.15 We found that S376F	 H398Y	 P417A	 and R420Q alone each conferred a degree of growth factor independence to 32D cells	 but this effect was considerably enhanced in 32Ds that overexpressed wild-type FLT3. In contrast	 wild-type CBL conferred no growth advantage either with or without FLT3 overexpression. The N454D change was not transforming	 indicating that it is probably a rare polymorphism or a pathogenetically unimportant passenger mutation (Figure 7). Reproducible differences in survival between the different mutants were seen	 as illustrated in Figure 8A.  Figure 7 Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpoint Figure 7 Transforming activity of CBL mutants. 32D cells or 32Ds overexpressing wild-type FLT3 were transfected with wild-type or mutant CBL constructs and assayed for IL-3 independent growth over 3 days.

(B) 32D cells expressing wild-type FLT3 and CBL constructs as indicated were transfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin and stimulated with FLT3 ligand. After lysis	 FLT3 was immunoprecipitated	 blotted	 and probed with anti-HA. Total blots for FLT3 AND CBL are also shown. Abrogation of E3 ubiquitin ligase activity  It has been shown that FLT3 physically associates with CBL and that	 upon ligand stimulation	 FLT3 is rapidly ubiquitinylated by wild-type but not R420Q CBL.15 We found that transforming activity correlated directly with the ubiquitin ligase activity of the CBL variants	 as assayed by their ability to transfer HA-tagged ubiquitin to FLT3 after stimulation with FLT3 ligand. The S376F	 H398Y	 P417A and R420Q mutants showed loss of ubiquitin ligase activity	 whereas N454D was comparable to wild-type CBL (Figure 8B).  Discussion  The initial aim of our study was to identify large regions of aUPD and therefore we undertook a relatively low resolution genome scan using 50k SNP arrays. Because we did not have constitutional DNA available from most of our cases	 we were not able to unambiguously determine whether the extended blocks of homozygosity that we observed were a consequence of aUPD	 constitutional UPD or autozygosity due to consaguinity	 however we used a very conservative definition of candidate aUPD regions (at least 20 Mb homozygous SNPs calls running to a telomere) and therefore expected that most or all would be acquired. We found that aUPD was relatively common in aCML	 but was uncommon in other MPNs that were negative for known mutations	 plus also CML blast crisis and CLL. Six distinct regions of aUPD were identified in aCML	 indicating substantial genetic heterogeneity in the genesis of this disorder. However	 we identified 2 recurrent regions of aUPD at 7q and 11q that were each seen in 10% of cases indicating the presence of common molecular abnormalities.  Our mutation screening focused primarily on tyrosine kinases and associated signal transduction components because of the known association between deregulated tyrosine kinase signaling and MPNs.3 Although we failed thus far to identify any abnormality on chromosome 7q	 we found missense CBL mutations in all three 11q aUPD cases. Screening of further MPNs revealed a total of 27 CBL variants in 26 patients who had been diagnosed with aCML (n = 12; 8%)	 MF (n = 3	 6%)	 CMML (n = 10	 13%)	 or HES/CEL (n = 1	 1%); that is	 morphologically and clinically related diseases that generally exhibit a poor prognosis. We were unable to discern	 however	 any specific clinical or prognostic features specifically associated with CBL mutated cases.  Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (CBL) is a well characterized protein that plays both positive and negative regulatory roles in tyrosine kinase signaling. In its positive role	 CBL binds to activated receptor tyrosine kinases via its N-terminal tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain and serves as an adaptor by recruiting downstream signal transduction components such as SHP2 and P13K. However the RING domain of CBL has E3 ligase activity and ubiquitinylates activated receptor tyrosine kinases on lysine residues	 a signal that triggers internalization of the receptor/ligand complex and subsequent recycling or degradation.21	24	25 CBL was originally identified after the characterization of v-Cbl	 the transforming component of the Cas NS-1 retrovirus	 and thus its association with neoplasia is well established26; however	 it is only very recently that CBL mutations were first identified in a human malignancy	 specifically occasional cases of AML.15	23	27 We have found that CBL mutations are much more common in MPNs	 and previous reports of 11q aUPD in MDS28 suggest that CBL mutations will also prove to be common in this disease. Indeed	 7 of 12 MDS cases with aUPD at 11q were recently shown to harbor CBL mutations.29 There are 2 other human CBL family members	 CBLB and CBLC	 but we did not identify aUPD in the regions containing these genes and did not detect any mutations of the linker/RING domain of CBLB.  We identified a total of 15 different CBL missense mutations affecting 12 residues (Table 2; Figure 3). Mutations of some of these residues (eg	 Y371	 C381	 H398 and W408) have been analyzed previously in a study that concluded that loss of E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and concomitant impairment of EGFR internalization by RING finger mutations was insufficient for oncogenicity	 as assayed in NIH3T3 cells. However mutations of key residues within the Î±-helix of the linker region abolished ubiquitin ligase activity and were transforming.30 Although the precise amino acid substitutions we identified were different from those studied	 we found that mutations in both the RING finger and linker regions conferred autonomous growth to 32D/wt-FLT3 cells	 consistent with a causal relationship to the MPN phenotype. The fact that one mutation (N454D) was not transforming emphasizes the importance of functional analysis to distinguish driver mutations from irrelevant passengers or infrequent polymorphisms.31 Notably	 this mutation was only weakly conserved between species	 in contrast to all other missense mutations that affected highly conserved residues and are therefore likely to be functionally significant.  Enhanced autonomous growth in the presence of CBL mutations and overexpression of wild-type FLT3 may simply reflect the paucity of receptor tyrosine kinase gene expression in 32D cells or	 alternatively	 may indicate that the mutants are only weakly transforming and require the cooperation of other events to give rise to clinically manifest disease. Consistent with the latter hypothesis	 we identified 2 cases in which CBL mutations were acquired during progression of a preexisting MPN (Figure 4). In both cases the identity of the cooperating change is unknown: although one presented with a (relatively low level) V617F JAK2 mutation	 this disappeared on progression to CBL L380P positive disease	 indicating that the 2 mutations must have arisen independently in different clones. This is reminiscent of the observation that the leukemic blasts of approximately half of V617F positive MPNs that evolve to AML are negative for the JAK2 mutation.32	33 It remains to be established	 however	 if CBL mutations are usually secondary events or whether the 2 cases we identified are exceptional.  Further evidence for the requirement for additional cooperating genetic events comes from published mouse studies in which neither complete CBL knockout nor heterozygous knockin of the RING finger inactivating mutant C379A (mouse C379 is equivalent to human C381) resulted in evidence of an MPN or other malignancy.34	35 However	 closer analysis revealed subtle hemopoietic perturbations that clearly relate to the pathogenesis of MPNs. Specifically	 hemopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from these animals were increased in number	 hyperresponsive to thrombopoietin and more potent than wild-type HSCs in repopulating the hemopoietic system. These effects were associated with increased STAT5 accumulation and phosphorylation.34	35 Hyperresponsiveness to growth factors and stem cell involvement are 2 of the cardinal features of MPNs. Furthermore	 the association between STAT5 activation and MPNs is well documented.36	37 While it is possible that overt hematologic disease might have been induced by a homozygous knockin mutant	 these findings suggest that CBL mutations may not be solely responsible for a full MPN phenotype.  The nature of any cooperating abnormalities remains largely obscure. Our results show that overexpression of a tyrosine kinase can cooperate with CBL mutants to promote transformation	 however we failed to identify any kinase that was consistently overexpressed in mutation positive cases by tyrosine kinase expression profiling (data not shown). One CBL mutation positive case	 however	 also tested positive for 7q UPD by SNP array	 suggesting that these 2 abnormalities may complement each other. A CBL mutation resulting in skipping of exon 8 has also been identified in a murine model of NUP98-HOXD13 on progression from MDS to AML	38 further corroborating the theory that acute leukemia arises from complementary mutations	 one of which inhibits differentiation	 and a second (in this case CBL) that enhances proliferation or inhibits apoptosis.  The fact that many CBL mutations are associated with aUPD strongly suggests that clones with homozygous mutations have a selective advantage over those that are heterozygous. This contrasts with the prevailing view that transforming CBL RING finger and linker region mutants act in a dominant negative fashion. Although it is conceivable that another	 unknown locus on 11q is the target of aUPD	 the finding of 1 case with a Y371H mutation and a stop codon on opposite alleles strongly suggests that homozygous CBL mutations do indeed confer a direct selective advantage. Because we did not screen the entire gene for mutations	 it is possible that other cases with heterozygous mutations may also be functionally homozygous due to premature stop codons on the other allele. Alternatively	 heterozygosity in these cases may only be apparent due to variable proportions of background normal cells that are not part of the malignant clone. Although the nontransforming N454D mutant was heterozygous	 2 cases with heterozygous R420Q were observed and thus absence of homozygosity cannot be used to infer the presence of an irrelevant	 nontransforming sequence variant.  In summary	 we have found that oncogenic CBL mutations are acquired in a subset of hematologically related	 poor prognosis MPNs. Our findings further strengthen the notion that MPNs are primarily â€œtyrosine kinopathies	â€ that is	 diseases caused by aberrant activation of proliferation and survival pathways as a consequence of mutations that either directly or indirectly promote excess tyrosine kinase signaling. In view of the fact that tyrosine kinases are such good drug targets	 the possibility that CBL-mutated cases might be amenable to therapeutic inhibition is clearly attractive.  																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											
4	24||Recent evidence has demonstrated that acquired uniparental disomy (aUPD) is a novel mechanism by which pathogenetic mutations in cancer may be reduced to homozygosity. To help identify novel mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs)	 we performed a genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) screen to identify aUPD in 58 patients with atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML; n = 30)	 JAK2 mutationâ€“negative myelofibrosis (MF; n = 18)	 or JAK2 mutationâ€“negative polycythemia vera (PV; n = 10). Stretches of homozygous	 copy neutral SNP calls greater than 20Mb were seen in 10 (33%) aCML and 1 (6%) MF	 but were absent in PV. In total	 7 different chromosomes were involved with 7q and 11q each affected in 10% of aCML cases. CBL mutations were identified in all 3 cases with 11q aUPD and analysis of 574 additional MPNs revealed a total of 27 CBL variants in 26 patients with aCML	 myelofibrosis or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Most variants were missense substitutions in the RING or linker domains that abrogated CBL ubiquitin ligase activity and conferred a proliferative advantage to 32D cells overexpressing FLT3. We conclude that acquired	 transforming CBL mutations are a novel and widespread pathogenetic abnormality in morphologically related	 clinically aggressive MPNs.  Introduction  Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by overproliferation of one or more myeloid cell lineages in the bone marrow and increased numbers of mature and immature myeloid cells in the peripheral blood. Excess proliferation is frequently associated with splenomegaly and cardiovascular complications as well as increased risk of transformation to acute leukemia. MPNs are categorized into subtypes based on specific morphologic	 hematologic	 and laboratory parameters	 the best characterized being the 4 so-called classic MPNs: polycythemia vera (PV)	 essential thrombocythemia (ET)	 primary myelofibrosis (MF)	 and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).1 In addition	 several atypical MPNs are recognized	 some of which show both dysplastic and proliferative features	 such as atypical	 BCR-ABL negative CML (aCML).2  MPNs are associated with acquired	 activating mutations or gene fusions of tyrosine kinases	 abnormalities that are believed to be critical drivers of excess proliferation as a result of deregulated or constitutive signaling.3 The 2 most prominent examples are BCR-ABL in CML4 and the V617F JAK2 mutation in PV	 ET	 and MF	5â‡“â‡“â€“8 but more than 40 variant tyrosine kinase fusions have been identified in MPNs as well as other mutations in JAK2 and FLT3.2 Activating mutations have been described in components that signal upstream (eg	 MPL) or downstream (eg	 NRAS) of tyrosine kinases9	10; however	 the molecular pathogenesis of the majority of atypical MPNs and approximately 50% of ET and MF cases remains obscure.  V617F JAK2 was initially identified by several different routes	 one of which was based on the observation that many PV patients show evidence of acquired uniparental disomy (aUPD) at chromosome 9p.11	12 Regions of aUPD exhibit loss of heterozygosity (LOH) compared with constitutional DNA without change of copy number and arise by mitotic recombination followed by selection for one of the products. After the initial observations in PV	 it has emerged that aUPD is common in both hematologic and epithelial malignancies	 and is associated with known oncogenic changes in a variety of genes within the affected regions.13 In this study we set out to determine whether aUPD characterizes MPNs of unknown molecular etiology and	 if so	 whether it could be used as a tool to help identify novel driver mutations.  Methods  Patients  Peripheral blood or bone marrow samples were received from patients diagnosed with an MPN or other hematologic malignancy according to standard morphologic	 hematologic	 and laboratory criteria. Clinical data were available from a subset of these cases. The study was approved by the Internal Review Boards from participating institutions and informed consent was obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.  SNP array analysis  DNA labeling and hybridization to Affymetrix 50k XbaI chips was performed at the Deutsches Ressourcenzentrum fÃ¼r Genomforschung (RZPD	 Berlin	 Germany). Raw data were imported into the Affymetrix GeneChip Operating Software	 analyzed using Affymetrix (High Wycombe	 United Kingdom) GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE 4.1) and copy number analysis tool (CNAT). Data were exported to custom-designed spreadsheets that display loss of heterozygosity and copy number changes in ideogram format. Data were also analyzed using Affymetrix Genotyping Console (version 2.1). Overall	 a median of 98.2% (range	 91.5%-99.6%) of SNPs gave readable calls.  Mutation analysis  Detection of mutations by high resolution melting (HRM) analysis was performed as described14 using a Rotor-Gene 6000 (Corbett Life Sciences	 St Neots	 United Kingdom). Direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products was performed by standard techniques on an ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems	 Warrington	 United Kingdom) and analyzed using Mutation Surveyor (SoftGenetics	 State College	 PA). CBL mutations are numbered relative to the ATG (A = 1) in the Ensembl cDNA sequence ENSG00000110395. A dropping factor (relative intensity drop of the wild-type allele peak relative to that seen in a concurrently run normal sample) of 60% or more was considered indicative of a biallelic mutation whereas a dropping factor of less than 60% was considered as monoallelic. Primer sequences for CBL exon 8 were CBL_i7f (5â€²-tgtggtttcactttaaaccctgga-3â€²) and CBL_i8r (5â€²-gccaggccaccccttgtatc-3â€²) and for CBL exon 9 were CBL_i8f (5â€²-ggcctggcttttgggttagg-3â€²) and CBL_i9r (5â€²-cacaatggattttgccagtctcc-3â€²). CBL reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) was performed on random hexamerâ€“reverse transcribed RNA using primers CBLe7F: 5â€²-gaatcctgatctgactggcttatg-3â€² and CBLe10R 5â€²-gctgcggcagaaggtcaagt-3â€². Other primer sequences are available on request.  Microsatellite analysis  DNA samples were amplified with a series of fluorescently labeled primer pairs flanking highly polymorphic microsatellite markers on chromosome 11q as described.10 aUPD was scored if 4 or more consecutive markers encompassing CBL were homozygous without change in allelic copy number (P < .05 of this occurring in the absence of aUPD based on published rates of heterozygosity). Copy number at 11q was estimated by multiplex ligation probe amplification (MLPA) using the Marfan probeset 1 (P065; MRC Holland	 Amsterdam	 The Netherlands)	 a kit that contains four 11q control probes including one at 11q23.3.  Constructs  pMY-wtCBL and pMY-CBLR420Q express wild-type and R420Q CBL	 respectively	 along with green fluorescent protein (GFP).15 Other CBL mutant constructs were derived from pMY-wtCBL using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene	 La Jolla	 CA). pAL/FLT3 and pCMVâ€“HA ubiquitin have also been described previously.15  Cell lines  The IL-3â€“dependent murine myeloid cell 32Dcl3 (32D) was purchased from the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (Braunschweig	 Germany) and was maintained in 90% RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10% WEHI-3B conditioned medium (WEHI). All cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37Â°C and 5% carbon dioxide. 32D cells were stably transduced by electroporation with wt-FLT3 in a pAL vector as previously described16 and maintained in 15 ng/mL blastocidin (Invitrogen	 Paisley United Kingdom). The Platinum-E (Plat-E) retrovirus packaging cell line17 was transfected using the calcium phosphate method with 5 Î¼g CBL construct DNA: 106 32D/wtFLT3 cells were cocultivated with the Plat-E cells for 48 hours in a volume of 2 mL (50% RPMI	 50% DMEM	 10% FBS	 5% WEHI). GFP positive cells were flow sorted to highest possible purity using a BD FACSAria cell sorter (Becton Dickinson	 Stanford	 CA). If insufficient cells were obtained for experiments after flow sorting	 the cells were maintained in culture and resorted to greater than 95% purity.  Growth factor withdrawal assays  Cell growth was compared with wt-FLT3	 vector-only transfected cells and the parental 32D line in stably transfected cells. Cells (105/mL) were grown over 3 days in triplicate for each CBL mutant and a wt-CBL control in 96-well plates. Cultures were analyzed daily for proliferation using the Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit (MTS assay; Promega	 Southampton	 United Kingdom). All experiments were performed at least 3 times independently and results were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 4 software (GraphPad Software	 San Diego	 CA).  Ubiquitin ligase activity  The ubiquitin ligase activity of CBL mutants in comparison to wild-type CBL was determined by transiently transfecting 107 32D/wtFLT3 cells expressing wild-type or CBL mutants by electroporation with 20 Î¼g pCMV-HA ubiquitin. Cells were maintained in culture with WEHI for 12 hours after transfection before being washed	 serum deprived overnight	 exposed to FLT3 ligand for 10 minutes	 and lysed in buffer as described.18 Lysates were incubated with a FLT3-specific polyclonal antibody overnight at 4Â°C. Protein G agarose beads (100 Î¼L) were added and incubated at 4Â°C for 4 hours. The beads were washed 4 times in ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer. The supernatant was mixed with sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) sample loading buffer before immunoblot analyses with antibodies against HA-ubiquitin (sc-805; Santa Cruz Biotechnology	 Santa Cruz	 CA)	 CBL (2111C3a; Abcam	 Cambridge	 United Kingdom)	 and FLT3 (sc-479; Cell Signaling Technology	 Danvers	 MA).  Results  SNP array analysis  We performed genome-wide SNP analysis on leukocyte DNA extracted from 58 MPD patients: aCML (n = 30)	 V617F JAK2 negative MF (n = 18)	 and JAK2 mutation negative PV/idiopathic erythrocytosis (n = 10). As comparators	 we also analyzed cases of CML in transformation to blast crisis (n = 30	 of which 20 were myeloid and 10 lymphoid) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; n = 20). We conservatively defined likely regions of aUPD as at least 20 Mb of absent or significantly reduced heterozygous SNP calls (ie	 < 5% SNPs called as heterozygous) running to a telomere without change in copy number (Figure 1A). Such large regions are uncommon in healthy individuals.19 Strikingly	 we found that aUPD was common in aCML with 10 (33%) of cases affected. In contrast	 aUPD was only seen in a single case of MF and was not seen in other patient subgroups. In total	 7 different chromosomes were affected	 with abnormalities at 7q and 11q each seen recurrently in 10% of aCML cases. The affected regions ranged in size from 29 Mb to a complete copy of chromosome 13 (Table 1).

(A) Array analysis of 2 control patients showing copy number (CN) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) outputs. The x-axis for the CN plots show (copy number)âˆ’2 as determined by CNAT	 with values approaching or exceeding âˆ’1 indicating deletions and greater than +1 indicating amplifications. The x-axis for LOH shows log10 P values (ie	 20 indicates 10âˆ’20). The 2 panels on the left are from a polycythemia vera (PV) case with a homozygous V617F JAK2 mutation. There is no gross copy number change (individual datapoints spread around the zero line)	 but a large block of homozygous SNP calls at 9p indicative of aUPD. The 2 panels on the right are from a chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) blast crisis case and show LOH accompanied by a 20q deletion. (B) For case UPN 5	 a large block of 11q aUPD is apparent on analysis of granulocytes but almost completely absent from mononuclear cells (MNCs) extracted from the same sample. (C) Chromosome 1p aUPD in case UPN 27 is associated with a biallelic G>T MPL mutation that is predicted to result in a W515L substitution. (D) Whole chromosome 13 isodisomy in case UPN 28 associated with a homozygous FLT3 ITD. Two controls are shown: an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient previously known to have a heterozygous FLT3 ITD and a healthy individual. View inlineView popup Table 1 Chromosomal regions and cases affected by aUPD Association between aUPD and known acquired oncogenic mutations  Although we did not have constitutional DNA to formally confirm that the regions of homozygosity were acquired	 in 1 individual we found a marked reduction in the proportion of 11q aUPD positive cells on comparison of mononuclear cells and granulocytes	 consistent with an acquired abnormality (Figure 1B). Some of the affected regions harbor genes known to be relevant to hematologic malignancies and therefore we assessed their mutational status. Sequencing of the MPL gene in the case UPN 27 with 1p aUPD revealed a homozygous G>T change (Figure 1C) that results in the previously reported W515L substitution.9 Case UPN 28 with whole chromosome 13 UPD had a homozygous FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD; Figure 1D). Candidate genes for the abnormalities at 17q and 21q include NF1 and RUNX1	 respectively; however	 these were not investigated.  11q aUPD is associated with CBL mutations  Next	 we focused our analysis on the 2 recurrent regions of aUPD at 7q and 11q. Because of the strong association between MPNs and aberrant tyrosine kinase signaling	 we analyzed genes encoding tyrosine kinases and associated signaling components. The minimally affected region at chromosome 7q contains 3 tyrosine kinases: MET	 EPHA1	 and EPHB6. We fully sequenced the coding exons of these genes in the 3 cases with 7q aUPD and 2 normal controls but found no abnormalities. Similarly	 we found no sequence changes in exons 11 through 17 of BRAF	 a gene encoding a downstream component of RAS signaling that is mutated in malignant melanoma and other cancers.20 There are no tyrosine kinase genes on chromosome 11q	 and although there are several genes encoding signal transduction components	 CBL stood out as a known oncogene that negatively regulates tyrosine kinase signaling.21 Sequencing of CBL in the three 11q aUPD cases revealed that UPN 2 and UPN 5 each had a T>C change at nucleotide 1277 in exon 8 that predicts a L380P substitution. Case UPN 3 had a C>G missense change in exon 9 at nucleotide 1387 that predicts a P417A change (Figure 2). Consistent with the array results	 the mutations in cases UPN 3 and UPN 5 were predominant with the residual wild-type alleles only weakly visible. For case UPN 2 both the mutation and level of aUPD was less prominent	 presumably due to a greater background of normal cells.

Prevalence and nature of CBL mutations  To determine the prevalence of CBL mutations	 we sequenced exons 8 and 9 (that encode amino acids 366 through 409 and 410 through 477	 respectively) in an additional 574 MPN cases. A total of 27 sequence variants were identified in 26 patients	 of whom 3 had MF	 10 had chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML)	 12 had aCML and 1 had hypereosinophilic syndrome/chronic eosinophilic leukemia (HES/CEL; Tables 2 and 3). To ensure that we were not missing mutations elsewhere in the gene we analyzed all coding exons in 70 CBL mutation negative aCML or unclassified	 CML-like MPN cases by high resolution melt (HRM) analysis but failed to detect any further sequence changes apart from known polymorphisms. Similarly	 no mutations in CBLB exons 9 or 10 or CBLC exons 7 and 8 (the exons that correspond to CBL exons 8 and 9) were identified. The activity of BCR-ABL is known to increase during progression of CML from chronic phase to blast crisis22 and we speculated that abrogation of CBL activity might be at least partially responsible for this increase. HRM analysis of CBL exons 8 and 9 in blast crisis cases (n = 31)	 however	 failed to reveal any mutations.  View inlineView popup Table 2 Cases analyzed for CBL mutations View inlineView popup Table 3 List of CBL sequence variants Of the 27 CBL variants	 21 (78%) were missense substitutions affecting 12 amino acids (15 different substitutions)	 5 (19%) were candidate splicing abnormalities	 and 1 (3%) produced a stop codon (Table 3). Most of the changes were novel	 although 4 cases had R420Q as previously identified in a single case of AML.15 Apart from N454D	 all residues affected by missense mutations were completely conserved in CBL orthologues as well as the 2 other human CBL family members (Figure 3). The mutation to a stop codon was found in a patient (UPN 9) who also had the Y371H variant; PCR across the affected regions and sequencing indicated that the 2 changes were on different alleles.

Residues affected by missense mutations found in this study are indicated by â–¼. CBL mutations are acquired and rarely seen in conjunction with other known mutations  For 2 cases (UPN 5 and UPN 14) we were able to compare the mutational status of leukocytes and T cells or buccal epithelia cells. In both cases the L380P mutation was only present in leukocytes and was therefore acquired (Figure 4A). A third case (UPN 15) originally presented with V617F JAK2 negative ET in 1989 but progressed to MF in 2004. Analysis of DNA extracted from sequential bone marrow slides indicated that the R420Q mutation was absent at the ET phase but acquired on transformation (Figure 4B). The 3 CBL-positive MF cases tested negative for MPL 515 mutations and all CBL mutation positive cases were negative for cytogenetic indicators of tyrosine kinase fusions	 FLT3 ITD	 activating NRAS mutations and V617F JAK2	 with the exception of 1 case (UPN 14) with MF who tested positive for both L380P CBL and V617F JAK2. Analysis of retrospective bone marrow slides for this case indicated the presence of V617F JAK2 at low level initially but absence of L380P CBL. The CBL mutation was detectable 7 years later and completely displaced V617F after a further 3 years	 corresponding with a significant rise is peripheral leukocyte counts (Figure 4C). A further case (UPN 21) presented with systemic mastocytosis before evolving to CBL mutation-positive CMML but retrospective samples were unavailable.

The JAK2 V617F mutation	 which had been present at low level since diagnosis	 was still detectable when CBL L380P first appeared but was undetectable in the 2008 sample	 when the CBL mutated clone predominated (* on sequence trace). (D) RT-PCR analysis. All cases and controls show the expected product from CBL exons 7-10. Cases UPN 18 and UPN 20 show smaller bands that result from complete deletion of exon 8. Splicing abnormalities  RNA was available for 3 of the 5 cases with potential splicing mutations. Patients UPN 18 and UPN 20 both exhibited double bands by RT-PCR	 sequencing of which showed one to be the normal product and the smaller band to result from the complete deletion of exon 8 in each case (Figure 4D)	 similar to that described in the cell line MOLM-13.23 Patient UPN 19 showed a single band by RT-PCR that was entirely normal on sequence analysis indicating that the exon 8+4 C>T change does not alter splicing. It seems likely	 therefore	 that the variant identified in case UPN 6 is also of no consequence. The pathogenicity of the intronic variant seen in case UPN 13 remains unknown.  The association between CBL mutations and UPD  To examine the association between CBL mutations and aUPD in more detail we performed microsatellite analysis on all mutated cases using 9 polymorphic markers spanning chromosome 11q13-qter. Of the 26 cases	 11 displayed patterns that indicated significant tracts of homozygosity	 including all 3 with 11q aUPD detected by SNP arrays. Case UPN 9 with 2 mutations was heterozygous for all markers. Of the 11 cases with biallelic CBL mutations as judged by sequence analysis	 5 showed complete homozygosity at all microsatellite loci tested and 6 had at least 4 consecutive homozygous calls encompassing the location of the CBL gene at 11q23.3 (Figure 5). We performed multiplex ligation probe amplification (MLPA) analysis to determine whether the observed homozygosity was a consequence of a deletion but no copy number changes were detected (data not shown) and therefore it is likely that homozygosity arose by aUPD. The number of mutated alleles estimated by sequencing was concordant with the microsatellite analysis in 20 cases (Figure 5). Of those that were discordant	 UPN 6 and UPN 25 had significant tracts of 11q homozygosity but had a monoallelic CBL mutation whereas UPN 10 and UPN 16 did not show 11q homozygosity but had clear biallelic CBL mutations. The reason for these discrepant cases is unclear	 but it is possible that the aUPD seen in UPN 6 and UPN 25 targeted another gene at 11q before acquisition of the CBL mutation. Homozygosity for the CBL mutations in the absence of 11q aUPD in UPN 10 and UPN 16 might be explained by a subcytogenetic deletion of 1 allele.  Figure 5 Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpoint Figure 5 Microsatellite analysis of CBL mutation positive cases. The number of CBL mutated alleles (1 monoallelic; 2 biallelic) was estimated by sequence analysis as described in â€œExperimental procedures.â€ Microsatellites were scored as homozygous (Embedded Image) or heterozygous (â–¡) for each case and their positions on chromosome 11q are indicated. Correlation between CBL mutations and clinical features  We compared clinical and hematologic features in patients with or without CBL mutations	 restricting the analysis to cases with aCML	 MF and CMML because these were the subgroups in which CBL mutations were most commonly found. Patients with CBL mutations had a shorter overall survival and progression-free survival compared with mutation negative cases (overall survival: 33 months vs 39 months; progression-free survival: 22 months vs 32 months) but the differences were not significant (Figure 6). Similarly there was no significant difference in gender distribution	 age and standard hematologic parameters between mutation positive and mutation negative cases and no differences emerged when individual disease entities were considered.

Overall survival (A) and progression-free survival (B) for atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML)	 chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML)	 and MF cases with (n = 19) or without (n = 87) CBL mutations. The differences between mutation positive and negative cases was not significant as determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Transforming activities of CBL mutants  We determined whether selected CBL variants had oncogenic activity by testing whether they could transform the interleukin-3 (IL-3)â€“dependent cell line 32D to growth factor independence in conjunction with overexpression of wild-type FLT3	 as has been described previously for R420Q.15 We found that S376F	 H398Y	 P417A	 and R420Q alone each conferred a degree of growth factor independence to 32D cells	 but this effect was considerably enhanced in 32Ds that overexpressed wild-type FLT3. In contrast	 wild-type CBL conferred no growth advantage either with or without FLT3 overexpression. The N454D change was not transforming	 indicating that it is probably a rare polymorphism or a pathogenetically unimportant passenger mutation (Figure 7). Reproducible differences in survival between the different mutants were seen	 as illustrated in Figure 8A.  Figure 7 Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpoint Figure 7 Transforming activity of CBL mutants. 32D cells or 32Ds overexpressing wild-type FLT3 were transfected with wild-type or mutant CBL constructs and assayed for IL-3 independent growth over 3 days.

(A) Relative survival/proliferation of 32D cells expressing wild-type or mutant CBL constructs 48 hours after growth factor withdrawal as determined by MTS assay. (B) 32D cells expressing wild-type FLT3 and CBL constructs as indicated were transfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin and stimulated with FLT3 ligand. After lysis	 FLT3 was immunoprecipitated	 blotted	 and probed with anti-HA. Total blots for FLT3 AND CBL are also shown. Abrogation of E3 ubiquitin ligase activity  It has been shown that FLT3 physically associates with CBL and that	 upon ligand stimulation	 FLT3 is rapidly ubiquitinylated by wild-type but not R420Q CBL.15 We found that transforming activity correlated directly with the ubiquitin ligase activity of the CBL variants	 as assayed by their ability to transfer HA-tagged ubiquitin to FLT3 after stimulation with FLT3 ligand. The S376F	 H398Y	 P417A and R420Q mutants showed loss of ubiquitin ligase activity	 whereas N454D was comparable to wild-type CBL (Figure 8B).  Discussion  The initial aim of our study was to identify large regions of aUPD and therefore we undertook a relatively low resolution genome scan using 50k SNP arrays. Because we did not have constitutional DNA available from most of our cases	 we were not able to unambiguously determine whether the extended blocks of homozygosity that we observed were a consequence of aUPD	 constitutional UPD or autozygosity due to consaguinity	 however we used a very conservative definition of candidate aUPD regions (at least 20 Mb homozygous SNPs calls running to a telomere) and therefore expected that most or all would be acquired. We found that aUPD was relatively common in aCML	 but was uncommon in other MPNs that were negative for known mutations	 plus also CML blast crisis and CLL. Six distinct regions of aUPD were identified in aCML	 indicating substantial genetic heterogeneity in the genesis of this disorder. However	 we identified 2 recurrent regions of aUPD at 7q and 11q that were each seen in 10% of cases indicating the presence of common molecular abnormalities.  Our mutation screening focused primarily on tyrosine kinases and associated signal transduction components because of the known association between deregulated tyrosine kinase signaling and MPNs.3 Although we failed thus far to identify any abnormality on chromosome 7q	 we found missense CBL mutations in all three 11q aUPD cases. Screening of further MPNs revealed a total of 27 CBL variants in 26 patients who had been diagnosed with aCML (n = 12; 8%)	 MF (n = 3	 6%)	 CMML (n = 10	 13%)	 or HES/CEL (n = 1	 1%); that is	 morphologically and clinically related diseases that generally exhibit a poor prognosis. We were unable to discern	 however	 any specific clinical or prognostic features specifically associated with CBL mutated cases.  Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (CBL) is a well characterized protein that plays both positive and negative regulatory roles in tyrosine kinase signaling. In its positive role	 CBL binds to activated receptor tyrosine kinases via its N-terminal tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain and serves as an adaptor by recruiting downstream signal transduction components such as SHP2 and P13K. However the RING domain of CBL has E3 ligase activity and ubiquitinylates activated receptor tyrosine kinases on lysine residues	 a signal that triggers internalization of the receptor/ligand complex and subsequent recycling or degradation.21	24	25 CBL was originally identified after the characterization of v-Cbl	 the transforming component of the Cas NS-1 retrovirus	 and thus its association with neoplasia is well established26; however	 it is only very recently that CBL mutations were first identified in a human malignancy	 specifically occasional cases of AML.15	23	27 We have found that CBL mutations are much more common in MPNs	 and previous reports of 11q aUPD in MDS28 suggest that CBL mutations will also prove to be common in this disease. Indeed	 7 of 12 MDS cases with aUPD at 11q were recently shown to harbor CBL mutations.29 There are 2 other human CBL family members	 CBLB and CBLC	 but we did not identify aUPD in the regions containing these genes and did not detect any mutations of the linker/RING domain of CBLB.  We identified a total of 15 different CBL missense mutations affecting 12 residues (Table 2; Figure 3). Mutations of some of these residues (eg	 Y371	 C381	 H398 and W408) have been analyzed previously in a study that concluded that loss of E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and concomitant impairment of EGFR internalization by RING finger mutations was insufficient for oncogenicity	 as assayed in NIH3T3 cells. However mutations of key residues within the Î±-helix of the linker region abolished ubiquitin ligase activity and were transforming.30 Although the precise amino acid substitutions we identified were different from those studied	 we found that mutations in both the RING finger and linker regions conferred autonomous growth to 32D/wt-FLT3 cells	 consistent with a causal relationship to the MPN phenotype. The fact that one mutation (N454D) was not transforming emphasizes the importance of functional analysis to distinguish driver mutations from irrelevant passengers or infrequent polymorphisms.31 Notably	 this mutation was only weakly conserved between species	 in contrast to all other missense mutations that affected highly conserved residues and are therefore likely to be functionally significant.  Enhanced autonomous growth in the presence of CBL mutations and overexpression of wild-type FLT3 may simply reflect the paucity of receptor tyrosine kinase gene expression in 32D cells or	 alternatively	 may indicate that the mutants are only weakly transforming and require the cooperation of other events to give rise to clinically manifest disease. Consistent with the latter hypothesis	 we identified 2 cases in which CBL mutations were acquired during progression of a preexisting MPN (Figure 4). In both cases the identity of the cooperating change is unknown: although one presented with a (relatively low level) V617F JAK2 mutation	 this disappeared on progression to CBL L380P positive disease	 indicating that the 2 mutations must have arisen independently in different clones. This is reminiscent of the observation that the leukemic blasts of approximately half of V617F positive MPNs that evolve to AML are negative for the JAK2 mutation.32	33 It remains to be established	 however	 if CBL mutations are usually secondary events or whether the 2 cases we identified are exceptional.  Further evidence for the requirement for additional cooperating genetic events comes from published mouse studies in which neither complete CBL knockout nor heterozygous knockin of the RING finger inactivating mutant C379A (mouse C379 is equivalent to human C381) resulted in evidence of an MPN or other malignancy.34	35 However	 closer analysis revealed subtle hemopoietic perturbations that clearly relate to the pathogenesis of MPNs. Specifically	 hemopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from these animals were increased in number	 hyperresponsive to thrombopoietin and more potent than wild-type HSCs in repopulating the hemopoietic system. These effects were associated with increased STAT5 accumulation and phosphorylation.34	35 Hyperresponsiveness to growth factors and stem cell involvement are 2 of the cardinal features of MPNs. Furthermore	 the association between STAT5 activation and MPNs is well documented.36	37 While it is possible that overt hematologic disease might have been induced by a homozygous knockin mutant	 these findings suggest that CBL mutations may not be solely responsible for a full MPN phenotype.  The nature of any cooperating abnormalities remains largely obscure. Our results show that overexpression of a tyrosine kinase can cooperate with CBL mutants to promote transformation	 however we failed to identify any kinase that was consistently overexpressed in mutation positive cases by tyrosine kinase expression profiling (data not shown). One CBL mutation positive case	 however	 also tested positive for 7q UPD by SNP array	 suggesting that these 2 abnormalities may complement each other. A CBL mutation resulting in skipping of exon 8 has also been identified in a murine model of NUP98-HOXD13 on progression from MDS to AML	38 further corroborating the theory that acute leukemia arises from complementary mutations	 one of which inhibits differentiation	 and a second (in this case CBL) that enhances proliferation or inhibits apoptosis.  The fact that many CBL mutations are associated with aUPD strongly suggests that clones with homozygous mutations have a selective advantage over those that are heterozygous. This contrasts with the prevailing view that transforming CBL RING finger and linker region mutants act in a dominant negative fashion. Although it is conceivable that another	 unknown locus on 11q is the target of aUPD	 the finding of 1 case with a Y371H mutation and a stop codon on opposite alleles strongly suggests that homozygous CBL mutations do indeed confer a direct selective advantage. Because we did not screen the entire gene for mutations	 it is possible that other cases with heterozygous mutations may also be functionally homozygous due to premature stop codons on the other allele. Alternatively	 heterozygosity in these cases may only be apparent due to variable proportions of background normal cells that are not part of the malignant clone. Although the nontransforming N454D mutant was heterozygous	 2 cases with heterozygous R420Q were observed and thus absence of homozygosity cannot be used to infer the presence of an irrelevant	 nontransforming sequence variant.  In summary	 we have found that oncogenic CBL mutations are acquired in a subset of hematologically related	 poor prognosis MPNs. Our findings further strengthen the notion that MPNs are primarily â€œtyrosine kinopathies	â€ that is	 diseases caused by aberrant activation of proliferation and survival pathways as a consequence of mutations that either directly or indirectly promote excess tyrosine kinase signaling. In view of the fact that tyrosine kinases are such good drug targets	 the possibility that CBL-mutated cases might be amenable to therapeutic inhibition is clearly attractive.  																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											
4	25||Recent evidence has demonstrated that acquired uniparental disomy (aUPD) is a novel mechanism by which pathogenetic mutations in cancer may be reduced to homozygosity. To help identify novel mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs)	 we performed a genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) screen to identify aUPD in 58 patients with atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML; n = 30)	 JAK2 mutationâ€“negative myelofibrosis (MF; n = 18)	 or JAK2 mutationâ€“negative polycythemia vera (PV; n = 10). Stretches of homozygous	 copy neutral SNP calls greater than 20Mb were seen in 10 (33%) aCML and 1 (6%) MF	 but were absent in PV. In total	 7 different chromosomes were involved with 7q and 11q each affected in 10% of aCML cases. CBL mutations were identified in all 3 cases with 11q aUPD and analysis of 574 additional MPNs revealed a total of 27 CBL variants in 26 patients with aCML	 myelofibrosis or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Most variants were missense substitutions in the RING or linker domains that abrogated CBL ubiquitin ligase activity and conferred a proliferative advantage to 32D cells overexpressing FLT3. We conclude that acquired	 transforming CBL mutations are a novel and widespread pathogenetic abnormality in morphologically related	 clinically aggressive MPNs.  Introduction  Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by overproliferation of one or more myeloid cell lineages in the bone marrow and increased numbers of mature and immature myeloid cells in the peripheral blood. Excess proliferation is frequently associated with splenomegaly and cardiovascular complications as well as increased risk of transformation to acute leukemia. MPNs are categorized into subtypes based on specific morphologic	 hematologic	 and laboratory parameters	 the best characterized being the 4 so-called classic MPNs: polycythemia vera (PV)	 essential thrombocythemia (ET)	 primary myelofibrosis (MF)	 and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).1 In addition	 several atypical MPNs are recognized	 some of which show both dysplastic and proliferative features	 such as atypical	 BCR-ABL negative CML (aCML).2  MPNs are associated with acquired	 activating mutations or gene fusions of tyrosine kinases	 abnormalities that are believed to be critical drivers of excess proliferation as a result of deregulated or constitutive signaling.3 The 2 most prominent examples are BCR-ABL in CML4 and the V617F JAK2 mutation in PV	 ET	 and MF	5â‡“â‡“â€“8 but more than 40 variant tyrosine kinase fusions have been identified in MPNs as well as other mutations in JAK2 and FLT3.2 Activating mutations have been described in components that signal upstream (eg	 MPL) or downstream (eg	 NRAS) of tyrosine kinases9	10; however	 the molecular pathogenesis of the majority of atypical MPNs and approximately 50% of ET and MF cases remains obscure.  V617F JAK2 was initially identified by several different routes	 one of which was based on the observation that many PV patients show evidence of acquired uniparental disomy (aUPD) at chromosome 9p.11	12 Regions of aUPD exhibit loss of heterozygosity (LOH) compared with constitutional DNA without change of copy number and arise by mitotic recombination followed by selection for one of the products. After the initial observations in PV	 it has emerged that aUPD is common in both hematologic and epithelial malignancies	 and is associated with known oncogenic changes in a variety of genes within the affected regions.13 In this study we set out to determine whether aUPD characterizes MPNs of unknown molecular etiology and	 if so	 whether it could be used as a tool to help identify novel driver mutations.  Methods  Patients  Peripheral blood or bone marrow samples were received from patients diagnosed with an MPN or other hematologic malignancy according to standard morphologic	 hematologic	 and laboratory criteria. Clinical data were available from a subset of these cases. The study was approved by the Internal Review Boards from participating institutions and informed consent was obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.  SNP array analysis  DNA labeling and hybridization to Affymetrix 50k XbaI chips was performed at the Deutsches Ressourcenzentrum fÃ¼r Genomforschung (RZPD	 Berlin	 Germany). Raw data were imported into the Affymetrix GeneChip Operating Software	 analyzed using Affymetrix (High Wycombe	 United Kingdom) GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE 4.1) and copy number analysis tool (CNAT). Data were exported to custom-designed spreadsheets that display loss of heterozygosity and copy number changes in ideogram format. Data were also analyzed using Affymetrix Genotyping Console (version 2.1). Overall	 a median of 98.2% (range	 91.5%-99.6%) of SNPs gave readable calls.  Mutation analysis  Detection of mutations by high resolution melting (HRM) analysis was performed as described14 using a Rotor-Gene 6000 (Corbett Life Sciences	 St Neots	 United Kingdom). Direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products was performed by standard techniques on an ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems	 Warrington	 United Kingdom) and analyzed using Mutation Surveyor (SoftGenetics	 State College	 PA). CBL mutations are numbered relative to the ATG (A = 1) in the Ensembl cDNA sequence ENSG00000110395. A dropping factor (relative intensity drop of the wild-type allele peak relative to that seen in a concurrently run normal sample) of 60% or more was considered indicative of a biallelic mutation whereas a dropping factor of less than 60% was considered as monoallelic. Primer sequences for CBL exon 8 were CBL_i7f (5â€²-tgtggtttcactttaaaccctgga-3â€²) and CBL_i8r (5â€²-gccaggccaccccttgtatc-3â€²) and for CBL exon 9 were CBL_i8f (5â€²-ggcctggcttttgggttagg-3â€²) and CBL_i9r (5â€²-cacaatggattttgccagtctcc-3â€²). CBL reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) was performed on random hexamerâ€“reverse transcribed RNA using primers CBLe7F: 5â€²-gaatcctgatctgactggcttatg-3â€² and CBLe10R 5â€²-gctgcggcagaaggtcaagt-3â€². Other primer sequences are available on request.  Microsatellite analysis  DNA samples were amplified with a series of fluorescently labeled primer pairs flanking highly polymorphic microsatellite markers on chromosome 11q as described.10 aUPD was scored if 4 or more consecutive markers encompassing CBL were homozygous without change in allelic copy number (P < .05 of this occurring in the absence of aUPD based on published rates of heterozygosity). Copy number at 11q was estimated by multiplex ligation probe amplification (MLPA) using the Marfan probeset 1 (P065; MRC Holland	 Amsterdam	 The Netherlands)	 a kit that contains four 11q control probes including one at 11q23.3.  Constructs  pMY-wtCBL and pMY-CBLR420Q express wild-type and R420Q CBL	 respectively	 along with green fluorescent protein (GFP).15 Other CBL mutant constructs were derived from pMY-wtCBL using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene	 La Jolla	 CA). pAL/FLT3 and pCMVâ€“HA ubiquitin have also been described previously.15  Cell lines  The IL-3â€“dependent murine myeloid cell 32Dcl3 (32D) was purchased from the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (Braunschweig	 Germany) and was maintained in 90% RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10% WEHI-3B conditioned medium (WEHI). All cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37Â°C and 5% carbon dioxide. 32D cells were stably transduced by electroporation with wt-FLT3 in a pAL vector as previously described16 and maintained in 15 ng/mL blastocidin (Invitrogen	 Paisley United Kingdom). The Platinum-E (Plat-E) retrovirus packaging cell line17 was transfected using the calcium phosphate method with 5 Î¼g CBL construct DNA: 106 32D/wtFLT3 cells were cocultivated with the Plat-E cells for 48 hours in a volume of 2 mL (50% RPMI	 50% DMEM	 10% FBS	 5% WEHI). GFP positive cells were flow sorted to highest possible purity using a BD FACSAria cell sorter (Becton Dickinson	 Stanford	 CA). If insufficient cells were obtained for experiments after flow sorting	 the cells were maintained in culture and resorted to greater than 95% purity.  Growth factor withdrawal assays  Cell growth was compared with wt-FLT3	 vector-only transfected cells and the parental 32D line in stably transfected cells. Cells (105/mL) were grown over 3 days in triplicate for each CBL mutant and a wt-CBL control in 96-well plates. Cultures were analyzed daily for proliferation using the Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit (MTS assay; Promega	 Southampton	 United Kingdom). All experiments were performed at least 3 times independently and results were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 4 software (GraphPad Software	 San Diego	 CA).  Ubiquitin ligase activity  The ubiquitin ligase activity of CBL mutants in comparison to wild-type CBL was determined by transiently transfecting 107 32D/wtFLT3 cells expressing wild-type or CBL mutants by electroporation with 20 Î¼g pCMV-HA ubiquitin. Cells were maintained in culture with WEHI for 12 hours after transfection before being washed	 serum deprived overnight	 exposed to FLT3 ligand for 10 minutes	 and lysed in buffer as described.18 Lysates were incubated with a FLT3-specific polyclonal antibody overnight at 4Â°C. Protein G agarose beads (100 Î¼L) were added and incubated at 4Â°C for 4 hours. The beads were washed 4 times in ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer. The supernatant was mixed with sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) sample loading buffer before immunoblot analyses with antibodies against HA-ubiquitin (sc-805; Santa Cruz Biotechnology	 Santa Cruz	 CA)	 CBL (2111C3a; Abcam	 Cambridge	 United Kingdom)	 and FLT3 (sc-479; Cell Signaling Technology	 Danvers	 MA).  Results  SNP array analysis  We performed genome-wide SNP analysis on leukocyte DNA extracted from 58 MPD patients: aCML (n = 30)	 V617F JAK2 negative MF (n = 18)	 and JAK2 mutation negative PV/idiopathic erythrocytosis (n = 10). As comparators	 we also analyzed cases of CML in transformation to blast crisis (n = 30	 of which 20 were myeloid and 10 lymphoid) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; n = 20). We conservatively defined likely regions of aUPD as at least 20 Mb of absent or significantly reduced heterozygous SNP calls (ie	 < 5% SNPs called as heterozygous) running to a telomere without change in copy number (Figure 1A). Such large regions are uncommon in healthy individuals.19 Strikingly	 we found that aUPD was common in aCML with 10 (33%) of cases affected. In contrast	 aUPD was only seen in a single case of MF and was not seen in other patient subgroups. In total	 7 different chromosomes were affected	 with abnormalities at 7q and 11q each seen recurrently in 10% of aCML cases. The affected regions ranged in size from 29 Mb to a complete copy of chromosome 13 (Table 1).

(A) Array analysis of 2 control patients showing copy number (CN) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) outputs. The x-axis for the CN plots show (copy number)âˆ’2 as determined by CNAT	 with values approaching or exceeding âˆ’1 indicating deletions and greater than +1 indicating amplifications. The x-axis for LOH shows log10 P values (ie	 20 indicates 10âˆ’20). The 2 panels on the left are from a polycythemia vera (PV) case with a homozygous V617F JAK2 mutation. There is no gross copy number change (individual datapoints spread around the zero line)	 but a large block of homozygous SNP calls at 9p indicative of aUPD. The 2 panels on the right are from a chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) blast crisis case and show LOH accompanied by a 20q deletion. (B) For case UPN 5	 a large block of 11q aUPD is apparent on analysis of granulocytes but almost completely absent from mononuclear cells (MNCs) extracted from the same sample. (C) Chromosome 1p aUPD in case UPN 27 is associated with a biallelic G>T MPL mutation that is predicted to result in a W515L substitution.

Two controls are shown: an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient previously known to have a heterozygous FLT3 ITD and a healthy individual. View inlineView popup Table 1 Chromosomal regions and cases affected by aUPD Association between aUPD and known acquired oncogenic mutations  Although we did not have constitutional DNA to formally confirm that the regions of homozygosity were acquired	 in 1 individual we found a marked reduction in the proportion of 11q aUPD positive cells on comparison of mononuclear cells and granulocytes	 consistent with an acquired abnormality (Figure 1B). Some of the affected regions harbor genes known to be relevant to hematologic malignancies and therefore we assessed their mutational status. Sequencing of the MPL gene in the case UPN 27 with 1p aUPD revealed a homozygous G>T change (Figure 1C) that results in the previously reported W515L substitution.9 Case UPN 28 with whole chromosome 13 UPD had a homozygous FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD; Figure 1D). Candidate genes for the abnormalities at 17q and 21q include NF1 and RUNX1	 respectively; however	 these were not investigated.  11q aUPD is associated with CBL mutations  Next	 we focused our analysis on the 2 recurrent regions of aUPD at 7q and 11q. Because of the strong association between MPNs and aberrant tyrosine kinase signaling	 we analyzed genes encoding tyrosine kinases and associated signaling components. The minimally affected region at chromosome 7q contains 3 tyrosine kinases: MET	 EPHA1	 and EPHB6. We fully sequenced the coding exons of these genes in the 3 cases with 7q aUPD and 2 normal controls but found no abnormalities. Similarly	 we found no sequence changes in exons 11 through 17 of BRAF	 a gene encoding a downstream component of RAS signaling that is mutated in malignant melanoma and other cancers.20 There are no tyrosine kinase genes on chromosome 11q	 and although there are several genes encoding signal transduction components	 CBL stood out as a known oncogene that negatively regulates tyrosine kinase signaling.21 Sequencing of CBL in the three 11q aUPD cases revealed that UPN 2 and UPN 5 each had a T>C change at nucleotide 1277 in exon 8 that predicts a L380P substitution. Case UPN 3 had a C>G missense change in exon 9 at nucleotide 1387 that predicts a P417A change (Figure 2). Consistent with the array results	 the mutations in cases UPN 3 and UPN 5 were predominant with the residual wild-type alleles only weakly visible. For case UPN 2 both the mutation and level of aUPD was less prominent	 presumably due to a greater background of normal cells.

Prevalence and nature of CBL mutations  To determine the prevalence of CBL mutations	 we sequenced exons 8 and 9 (that encode amino acids 366 through 409 and 410 through 477	 respectively) in an additional 574 MPN cases. A total of 27 sequence variants were identified in 26 patients	 of whom 3 had MF	 10 had chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML)	 12 had aCML and 1 had hypereosinophilic syndrome/chronic eosinophilic leukemia (HES/CEL; Tables 2 and 3). To ensure that we were not missing mutations elsewhere in the gene we analyzed all coding exons in 70 CBL mutation negative aCML or unclassified	 CML-like MPN cases by high resolution melt (HRM) analysis but failed to detect any further sequence changes apart from known polymorphisms. Similarly	 no mutations in CBLB exons 9 or 10 or CBLC exons 7 and 8 (the exons that correspond to CBL exons 8 and 9) were identified. The activity of BCR-ABL is known to increase during progression of CML from chronic phase to blast crisis22 and we speculated that abrogation of CBL activity might be at least partially responsible for this increase. HRM analysis of CBL exons 8 and 9 in blast crisis cases (n = 31)	 however	 failed to reveal any mutations.  View inlineView popup Table 2 Cases analyzed for CBL mutations View inlineView popup Table 3 List of CBL sequence variants Of the 27 CBL variants	 21 (78%) were missense substitutions affecting 12 amino acids (15 different substitutions)	 5 (19%) were candidate splicing abnormalities	 and 1 (3%) produced a stop codon (Table 3). Most of the changes were novel	 although 4 cases had R420Q as previously identified in a single case of AML.15 Apart from N454D	 all residues affected by missense mutations were completely conserved in CBL orthologues as well as the 2 other human CBL family members (Figure 3). The mutation to a stop codon was found in a patient (UPN 9) who also had the Y371H variant; PCR across the affected regions and sequencing indicated that the 2 changes were on different alleles.

Residues affected by missense mutations found in this study are indicated by â–¼. CBL mutations are acquired and rarely seen in conjunction with other known mutations  For 2 cases (UPN 5 and UPN 14) we were able to compare the mutational status of leukocytes and T cells or buccal epithelia cells. In both cases the L380P mutation was only present in leukocytes and was therefore acquired (Figure 4A). A third case (UPN 15) originally presented with V617F JAK2 negative ET in 1989 but progressed to MF in 2004. Analysis of DNA extracted from sequential bone marrow slides indicated that the R420Q mutation was absent at the ET phase but acquired on transformation (Figure 4B). The 3 CBL-positive MF cases tested negative for MPL 515 mutations and all CBL mutation positive cases were negative for cytogenetic indicators of tyrosine kinase fusions	 FLT3 ITD	 activating NRAS mutations and V617F JAK2	 with the exception of 1 case (UPN 14) with MF who tested positive for both L380P CBL and V617F JAK2. Analysis of retrospective bone marrow slides for this case indicated the presence of V617F JAK2 at low level initially but absence of L380P CBL. The CBL mutation was detectable 7 years later and completely displaced V617F after a further 3 years	 corresponding with a significant rise is peripheral leukocyte counts (Figure 4C). A further case (UPN 21) presented with systemic mastocytosis before evolving to CBL mutation-positive CMML but retrospective samples were unavailable.

The JAK2 V617F mutation	 which had been present at low level since diagnosis	 was still detectable when CBL L380P first appeared but was undetectable in the 2008 sample	 when the CBL mutated clone predominated (* on sequence trace). (D) RT-PCR analysis. All cases and controls show the expected product from CBL exons 7-10. Cases UPN 18 and UPN 20 show smaller bands that result from complete deletion of exon 8. Splicing abnormalities  RNA was available for 3 of the 5 cases with potential splicing mutations. Patients UPN 18 and UPN 20 both exhibited double bands by RT-PCR	 sequencing of which showed one to be the normal product and the smaller band to result from the complete deletion of exon 8 in each case (Figure 4D)	 similar to that described in the cell line MOLM-13.23 Patient UPN 19 showed a single band by RT-PCR that was entirely normal on sequence analysis indicating that the exon 8+4 C>T change does not alter splicing. It seems likely	 therefore	 that the variant identified in case UPN 6 is also of no consequence. The pathogenicity of the intronic variant seen in case UPN 13 remains unknown.  The association between CBL mutations and UPD  To examine the association between CBL mutations and aUPD in more detail we performed microsatellite analysis on all mutated cases using 9 polymorphic markers spanning chromosome 11q13-qter. Of the 26 cases	 11 displayed patterns that indicated significant tracts of homozygosity	 including all 3 with 11q aUPD detected by SNP arrays. Case UPN 9 with 2 mutations was heterozygous for all markers. Of the 11 cases with biallelic CBL mutations as judged by sequence analysis	 5 showed complete homozygosity at all microsatellite loci tested and 6 had at least 4 consecutive homozygous calls encompassing the location of the CBL gene at 11q23.3 (Figure 5). We performed multiplex ligation probe amplification (MLPA) analysis to determine whether the observed homozygosity was a consequence of a deletion but no copy number changes were detected (data not shown) and therefore it is likely that homozygosity arose by aUPD. The number of mutated alleles estimated by sequencing was concordant with the microsatellite analysis in 20 cases (Figure 5). Of those that were discordant	 UPN 6 and UPN 25 had significant tracts of 11q homozygosity but had a monoallelic CBL mutation whereas UPN 10 and UPN 16 did not show 11q homozygosity but had clear biallelic CBL mutations. The reason for these discrepant cases is unclear	 but it is possible that the aUPD seen in UPN 6 and UPN 25 targeted another gene at 11q before acquisition of the CBL mutation. Homozygosity for the CBL mutations in the absence of 11q aUPD in UPN 10 and UPN 16 might be explained by a subcytogenetic deletion of 1 allele.  Figure 5 Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpoint Figure 5 Microsatellite analysis of CBL mutation positive cases. The number of CBL mutated alleles (1 monoallelic; 2 biallelic) was estimated by sequence analysis as described in â€œExperimental procedures.â€ Microsatellites were scored as homozygous (Embedded Image) or heterozygous (â–¡) for each case and their positions on chromosome 11q are indicated. Correlation between CBL mutations and clinical features  We compared clinical and hematologic features in patients with or without CBL mutations	 restricting the analysis to cases with aCML	 MF and CMML because these were the subgroups in which CBL mutations were most commonly found. Patients with CBL mutations had a shorter overall survival and progression-free survival compared with mutation negative cases (overall survival: 33 months vs 39 months; progression-free survival: 22 months vs 32 months) but the differences were not significant (Figure 6). Similarly there was no significant difference in gender distribution	 age and standard hematologic parameters between mutation positive and mutation negative cases and no differences emerged when individual disease entities were considered.  Figure 6 Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpoint Figure 6 Clinical significance of CBL mutations. Overall survival (A) and progression-free survival (B) for atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML)	 chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML)	 and MF cases with (n = 19) or without (n = 87) CBL mutations. The differences between mutation positive and negative cases was not significant as determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Transforming activities of CBL mutants  We determined whether selected CBL variants had oncogenic activity by testing whether they could transform the interleukin-3 (IL-3)â€“dependent cell line 32D to growth factor independence in conjunction with overexpression of wild-type FLT3	 as has been described previously for R420Q.15 We found that S376F	 H398Y	 P417A	 and R420Q alone each conferred a degree of growth factor independence to 32D cells	 but this effect was considerably enhanced in 32Ds that overexpressed wild-type FLT3. In contrast	 wild-type CBL conferred no growth advantage either with or without FLT3 overexpression. The N454D change was not transforming	 indicating that it is probably a rare polymorphism or a pathogenetically unimportant passenger mutation (Figure 7). Reproducible differences in survival between the different mutants were seen	 as illustrated in Figure 8A.

(A) Relative survival/proliferation of 32D cells expressing wild-type or mutant CBL constructs 48 hours after growth factor withdrawal as determined by MTS assay. (B) 32D cells expressing wild-type FLT3 and CBL constructs as indicated were transfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin and stimulated with FLT3 ligand. After lysis	 FLT3 was immunoprecipitated	 blotted	 and probed with anti-HA. Total blots for FLT3 AND CBL are also shown. Abrogation of E3 ubiquitin ligase activity  It has been shown that FLT3 physically associates with CBL and that	 upon ligand stimulation	 FLT3 is rapidly ubiquitinylated by wild-type but not R420Q CBL.15 We found that transforming activity correlated directly with the ubiquitin ligase activity of the CBL variants	 as assayed by their ability to transfer HA-tagged ubiquitin to FLT3 after stimulation with FLT3 ligand. The S376F	 H398Y	 P417A and R420Q mutants showed loss of ubiquitin ligase activity	 whereas N454D was comparable to wild-type CBL (Figure 8B).  Discussion  The initial aim of our study was to identify large regions of aUPD and therefore we undertook a relatively low resolution genome scan using 50k SNP arrays. Because we did not have constitutional DNA available from most of our cases	 we were not able to unambiguously determine whether the extended blocks of homozygosity that we observed were a consequence of aUPD	 constitutional UPD or autozygosity due to consaguinity	 however we used a very conservative definition of candidate aUPD regions (at least 20 Mb homozygous SNPs calls running to a telomere) and therefore expected that most or all would be acquired. We found that aUPD was relatively common in aCML	 but was uncommon in other MPNs that were negative for known mutations	 plus also CML blast crisis and CLL. Six distinct regions of aUPD were identified in aCML	 indicating substantial genetic heterogeneity in the genesis of this disorder. However	 we identified 2 recurrent regions of aUPD at 7q and 11q that were each seen in 10% of cases indicating the presence of common molecular abnormalities.  Our mutation screening focused primarily on tyrosine kinases and associated signal transduction components because of the known association between deregulated tyrosine kinase signaling and MPNs.3 Although we failed thus far to identify any abnormality on chromosome 7q	 we found missense CBL mutations in all three 11q aUPD cases. Screening of further MPNs revealed a total of 27 CBL variants in 26 patients who had been diagnosed with aCML (n = 12; 8%)	 MF (n = 3	 6%)	 CMML (n = 10	 13%)	 or HES/CEL (n = 1	 1%); that is	 morphologically and clinically related diseases that generally exhibit a poor prognosis. We were unable to discern	 however	 any specific clinical or prognostic features specifically associated with CBL mutated cases.  Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (CBL) is a well characterized protein that plays both positive and negative regulatory roles in tyrosine kinase signaling. In its positive role	 CBL binds to activated receptor tyrosine kinases via its N-terminal tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain and serves as an adaptor by recruiting downstream signal transduction components such as SHP2 and P13K. However the RING domain of CBL has E3 ligase activity and ubiquitinylates activated receptor tyrosine kinases on lysine residues	 a signal that triggers internalization of the receptor/ligand complex and subsequent recycling or degradation.21	24	25 CBL was originally identified after the characterization of v-Cbl	 the transforming component of the Cas NS-1 retrovirus	 and thus its association with neoplasia is well established26; however	 it is only very recently that CBL mutations were first identified in a human malignancy	 specifically occasional cases of AML.15	23	27 We have found that CBL mutations are much more common in MPNs	 and previous reports of 11q aUPD in MDS28 suggest that CBL mutations will also prove to be common in this disease. Indeed	 7 of 12 MDS cases with aUPD at 11q were recently shown to harbor CBL mutations.29 There are 2 other human CBL family members	 CBLB and CBLC	 but we did not identify aUPD in the regions containing these genes and did not detect any mutations of the linker/RING domain of CBLB.  We identified a total of 15 different CBL missense mutations affecting 12 residues (Table 2; Figure 3). Mutations of some of these residues (eg	 Y371	 C381	 H398 and W408) have been analyzed previously in a study that concluded that loss of E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and concomitant impairment of EGFR internalization by RING finger mutations was insufficient for oncogenicity	 as assayed in NIH3T3 cells. However mutations of key residues within the Î±-helix of the linker region abolished ubiquitin ligase activity and were transforming.30 Although the precise amino acid substitutions we identified were different from those studied	 we found that mutations in both the RING finger and linker regions conferred autonomous growth to 32D/wt-FLT3 cells	 consistent with a causal relationship to the MPN phenotype. The fact that one mutation (N454D) was not transforming emphasizes the importance of functional analysis to distinguish driver mutations from irrelevant passengers or infrequent polymorphisms.31 Notably	 this mutation was only weakly conserved between species	 in contrast to all other missense mutations that affected highly conserved residues and are therefore likely to be functionally significant.  Enhanced autonomous growth in the presence of CBL mutations and overexpression of wild-type FLT3 may simply reflect the paucity of receptor tyrosine kinase gene expression in 32D cells or	 alternatively	 may indicate that the mutants are only weakly transforming and require the cooperation of other events to give rise to clinically manifest disease. Consistent with the latter hypothesis	 we identified 2 cases in which CBL mutations were acquired during progression of a preexisting MPN (Figure 4). In both cases the identity of the cooperating change is unknown: although one presented with a (relatively low level) V617F JAK2 mutation	 this disappeared on progression to CBL L380P positive disease	 indicating that the 2 mutations must have arisen independently in different clones. This is reminiscent of the observation that the leukemic blasts of approximately half of V617F positive MPNs that evolve to AML are negative for the JAK2 mutation.32	33 It remains to be established	 however	 if CBL mutations are usually secondary events or whether the 2 cases we identified are exceptional.  Further evidence for the requirement for additional cooperating genetic events comes from published mouse studies in which neither complete CBL knockout nor heterozygous knockin of the RING finger inactivating mutant C379A (mouse C379 is equivalent to human C381) resulted in evidence of an MPN or other malignancy.34	35 However	 closer analysis revealed subtle hemopoietic perturbations that clearly relate to the pathogenesis of MPNs. Specifically	 hemopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from these animals were increased in number	 hyperresponsive to thrombopoietin and more potent than wild-type HSCs in repopulating the hemopoietic system. These effects were associated with increased STAT5 accumulation and phosphorylation.34	35 Hyperresponsiveness to growth factors and stem cell involvement are 2 of the cardinal features of MPNs. Furthermore	 the association between STAT5 activation and MPNs is well documented.36	37 While it is possible that overt hematologic disease might have been induced by a homozygous knockin mutant	 these findings suggest that CBL mutations may not be solely responsible for a full MPN phenotype.  The nature of any cooperating abnormalities remains largely obscure. Our results show that overexpression of a tyrosine kinase can cooperate with CBL mutants to promote transformation	 however we failed to identify any kinase that was consistently overexpressed in mutation positive cases by tyrosine kinase expression profiling (data not shown). One CBL mutation positive case	 however	 also tested positive for 7q UPD by SNP array	 suggesting that these 2 abnormalities may complement each other. A CBL mutation resulting in skipping of exon 8 has also been identified in a murine model of NUP98-HOXD13 on progression from MDS to AML	38 further corroborating the theory that acute leukemia arises from complementary mutations	 one of which inhibits differentiation	 and a second (in this case CBL) that enhances proliferation or inhibits apoptosis.  The fact that many CBL mutations are associated with aUPD strongly suggests that clones with homozygous mutations have a selective advantage over those that are heterozygous. This contrasts with the prevailing view that transforming CBL RING finger and linker region mutants act in a dominant negative fashion. Although it is conceivable that another	 unknown locus on 11q is the target of aUPD	 the finding of 1 case with a Y371H mutation and a stop codon on opposite alleles strongly suggests that homozygous CBL mutations do indeed confer a direct selective advantage. Because we did not screen the entire gene for mutations	 it is possible that other cases with heterozygous mutations may also be functionally homozygous due to premature stop codons on the other allele. Alternatively	 heterozygosity in these cases may only be apparent due to variable proportions of background normal cells that are not part of the malignant clone. Although the nontransforming N454D mutant was heterozygous	 2 cases with heterozygous R420Q were observed and thus absence of homozygosity cannot be used to infer the presence of an irrelevant	 nontransforming sequence variant.  In summary	 we have found that oncogenic CBL mutations are acquired in a subset of hematologically related	 poor prognosis MPNs. Our findings further strengthen the notion that MPNs are primarily â€œtyrosine kinopathies	â€ that is	 diseases caused by aberrant activation of proliferation and survival pathways as a consequence of mutations that either directly or indirectly promote excess tyrosine kinase signaling. In view of the fact that tyrosine kinases are such good drug targets	 the possibility that CBL-mutated cases might be amenable to therapeutic inhibition is clearly attractive.  																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											
4	26|| Abstract N-myristoylation is a common form of co-translational protein fatty acylation resulting from the attachment of myristate to a required N-terminal glycine residue.1	2 We show that aberrantly acquired N-myristoylation of SHOC2	 a leucine-rich repeat-containing protein that positively modulates RAS-MAPK signal flow	3â€“6 underlies a clinically distinctive condition of the neuro-cardio-facial-cutaneous disorders family. Twenty-five subjects with a relatively consistent phenotype previously termed Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair [OMIM 607721]7 shared the 4A>G missense change (Ser2Gly) in SHOC2 that introduces an N-myristoylation site	 resulting in aberrant targeting of SHOC2 to the plasma membrane and impaired translocation to the nucleus upon growth factor stimulation. Expression of SHOC2S2G in vitro enhanced MAPK activation in a cell type-specific fashion. Induction of SHOC2S2G in Caenorhabditis elegans engendered protruding vulva	 a neomorphic phenotype previously associated with aberrant signaling. These results document the first example of an acquired N-terminal lipid modification of a protein causing human disease.  Dysregulation of the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway has recently been recognized as the molecular cause underlying a group of clinically related developmental disorders with features including reduced growth	 facial dysmorphism	 cardiac defects	 ectodermal anomalies	 variable cognitive deficits and susceptibility to certain malignancies8	9. These Mendelian traits are caused by mutations in genes encoding RAS proteins (KRAS and HRAS)	 downstream transducers (RAF1	 BRAF	 MEK1 and MEK2)	 or pathway regulators (PTPN11	 SOS1	 NF1 and SPRED1). For NS (NS)	 the commonest of these disorders	 mutations are observed in several of these	 constituting approximately 70% of cases.  To rationalize further candidate gene approaches to NS gene discovery	 we used a systems biology approach based on in silico protein network analysis. By applying a graph theory algorithm on a filtered consolidated human interactome	 we derived a subnetwork of proteins generated from an integrated network of mammalian protein interaction databases and cell-signaling network datasets by seeding with the known RAS/MAPK mutant proteins (Supplementary Fig. 1a online). To identify potential NS disease genes	 Z scores were computed using a binomial proportions test	 ranking the significance of the intermediate nodes within the subnetwork based on their connections to the seed proteins10 (Supplementary Table 1 online). Resequencing of coding exons for the best candidate	 SHOC2	 in a NS cohort including 96 individuals who were negative for mutations in known disease genes and opportunely selected to represent the wide phenotypic spectrum characterizing this disorder revealed an A-to-G transition at position 4 of the gene	 predicting the Ser2Gly amino acid substitution (S2G)	 in four unrelated individuals (Supplementary Fig. 1b online). All cases were sporadic	 and genotyping of parental DNAs available for three of the four subjects documented the absence of the sequence variant in the parents and confirmed paternity in each family	 providing evidence that the change was a de novo mutation associated with the disease. For these subjects	 DNAs from several tissues were available and all harboured the S2G mutation	 providing evidence that the defect was inherited through the germline. We then analyzed SHOC2 in a cohort of 410 mutation-negative subjects with NS or a related phenotype. We observed 21 with the 4A>G missense change and proved that mutations were de novo in twelve families from which parental DNAs were available. No additional disease-associated SHOC2 sequence variant was identified in the analyzed cohort	 strongly suggesting a specific pathogenetic role for the S2G amino acid substitution.  Review of the clinical features of the SHOC2 mutation-positive individuals revealed a consistent phenotype	 previously termed Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair 7. While their facial features seemed typical for NS (Fig. 1a)	 phenotype analysis of these subjects was notable for the observation that they exhibited reduced growth	 which was frequently associated with proven GH deficiency	 cognitive deficits	 distinctive hyperactive behaviour that improved with age in most subjects	 and hair anomalies including easily pluckable	 sparse	 thin	 slow growing hair. In twelve subjects	 a diagnosis of loose anagen hair was confirmed by microscopic examination of pulled hairs. Most of them also exhibited darkly pigmented skin with eczema or ichthyosis. Cardiac anomalies were observed in the majority of the cases	 with dysplasia of the mitral valve and septal defects significantly overrepresented compared with the general NS population. The voice was characteristically hypernasal. Of note	 the referring pediatricians felt that several of these subjects had features suggestive of Costello syndrome or cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome	 as newborns or young infants. Overall	 these subjects appeared to share a phenotype that was characterized by an unusual combination of features observed in disorders of the neuro-cardio-facial-cutaneous disorders family (Supplementary Table 2 online).  Figure 1 Figure 1 The germline 4A>G mutation in the SHOC2 gene underlies a distinctive phenotype of the neuro-cardio-facial-cutaneous syndrome family SHOC2 is a widely expressed protein composed almost entirely by leucine-rich repeats (LRR) with a lysine-rich sequence at the N-terminus (Fig. 1b). In C. elegans	 where SHOC2/SUR-8/SOC-2 was discovered	 the protein acts as a positive modulator of the signal transduction elicited by EGL-15 and LET-23	 and mediated by LET-60	 homologues of vertebrate FGFR	 EGFR and RAS family members	 respectively3	4. Since LRRs can provide a structural framework for protein-protein interactions	 SHOC2 is believed to function as a scaffold linking RAS to downstream signal transducers4â€“6. Based on the N-terminal position of the S2G substitution	 we hypothesized that co-translational processing might be perturbed in the mutant protein	 making it a substrate for the N-myristoyltransferase (NMT). N-terminal myristoylation is an irreversible modification generally occurring during protein synthesis	 in which myristate	 a 14-carbon saturated fatty acid	 is covalently added to an N-terminal glycine residues after excision of the initiator methionine residue by methionylaminopeptidase1	2. Glycine at codon 2 is absolutely required	 small uncharged residues at positions 3 and 6 are generally needed	 and basic residues at positions 7â€“9 are preferred11. Save the presence of Ser at position 2	 the N-terminal sequence of the SHOC2 satisfied those consensus rules	 and in silico analysis predicted myristoylation of the SHOC2S2G mutant with high confidence. To verify this	 the myristoylation status of wild type and mutant SHOC2 proteins transiently expressed in Cos-1 cells was evaluated (Fig. 2a). SHOC2S2G incorporated [3H]-myristic acid	 while the wild type protein and the disease-unrelated SHOC2S2A did not.  Figure 2 Figure 2 The disease-causing 4A>G change in SHOC2 promotes protein myristoylation and cell membrane targeting N-myristoylation facilitates anchoring of proteins to intracellular membranes. To explore whether it conferred membrane targeting to mutant SHOC2	 the subcellular localization of V5-tagged SHOC2 proteins was analyzed in Cos-1 cells (Fig. 2b	d). Confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis documented that SHOC2wt was uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm and nucleus in starved cells but was restricted to the nucleus following EGF stimulation	 implying an unexpected role for this protein in signal transduction. In contrast	 SHOC2S2G was specifically targeted to the cell membrane in both states. This aberrant localization of SHOC2S2G was confirmed in 293T and Neuro2A cell lines and using a Myc-tagged protein (data not shown)	 as well as by cell fractionation (Fig. 2c). Growth factor-stimulated nuclear translocation of the endogenous SHOC2 protein was confirmed in primary skin fibroblasts (Fig. 2e). Treatment with 2-hydroxymyristic acid	 an NMT inhibitor	 at varying doses reduced or abolished SHOC2S2Gâ€™s membrane localization (Supplementary Fig. 2 online)	 confirming a dependency upon myristoylation. In addition	 even in the absence of efficient myristoylation	 the mutant did not translocate to the nucleus upon stimulation	 indicating possible loss of function. Efficient nuclear translocation was observed for the disease-unrelated SHOC2S2A mutant following EGF stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 3 online)	 suggesting a specific effect of the disease-causing mutation. To exclude the possibility that SHOC2S2G might play a dominant negative effect by sequestering the wild-type protein to the cell membrane	 impairing its EGF-dependent translocation to the nucleus	 SHOC2wt and SHOC2S2G heterodimerization was assayed by confocal microscopy and co-immunoprecipitation assays in Cos-1 cells transiently co-transfected with V5- and Myc-tagged proteins (Fig. 3a	b). The experiments demonstrated that these proteins do not heterodimerize	 ruling out that possibility. Next	 we explored whether SHOC2S2G altered signaling through MAPK. We expressed SHOC2wt or SHOC2S2G in Cos-1	 293T	 and Neuro2A cells. While we did not observe significant change in ERK activation in Cos-1 and 293T cells (data not shown)	 SHOC2S2G expression promoted enhanced EGF-dependent ERK phosphorylation compared to wild type SHOC2	 in neuroblastoma Neuro2A cells (Fig. 3c).  Figure 3 Figure 3 Functional characterization of the disease-causing 4A>G change in SHOC2 To explore further the functional effects of the SHOC2S2G mutant	 we used C. elegans as an experimental model. In C. elegans	 reduced SUR-8 function (Sur8rf) causes no phenotype but can suppress the gain-of-function LET-60 (let-60gof)-induced multivulva phenotype (Muv)4. We tested whether expression of SHOC2 proteins could rescue the suppressed Muv phenotype in the sur-8rf;let-60gof genetic background (Supplementary Table 3 online). While SHOC2wt was able to replace SUR-8 functionally	 SHOC2S2G failed to do so. Expression of the mutant in let-60gof worms did not suppress the Muv phenotype (Supplementary Table 3 online)	 excluding dominant negative effects for SHOC2S2G. In a wild-type genetic background	 SHOC2S2G expression at embryonic and early larval stages of development caused no visible phenotype. In contrast	 at early L3 stage	 it caused abnormal vulval development	 resulting in protruding vulva (Pvl)	 decreased egg laying efficiency (Egl) and accumulation of larvae inside the mother with the formation of bag-of-worms adults (Bag phenotype) (Supplementary Table 4 online and Fig. 4b	c). These neomorphic phenotypes were absent in animals expressing SHOC2wt but were also observed when SHOC2wt tagged with an N-myristoylation sequence (myr::SHOC2wt) was expressed (Supplementary Table 4 online and Fig. 4a	d). The SHOC2S2G and myr::SHOC2wt proteins were targeted to the cell membrane in various C. elegans cell types	 while SHOC2wt was observed diffusely throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 4eâ€“j). The defects in vulva formation were not due to increased induction of the vulva cell fate in vulval precursor cells (VPC) as expression of SHOC2S2G did not reduce the penetrance of the vulvaless phenotype of a let-23rf hypomorph mutant (Supplementary Table 5 online)	 nor increase that of the Muv phenotype of let-60gf animals (Supplementary Table 3 online). At the late L3/early L4 stage	 vulva morphogenesis normally begins with the descendants of VPC P6.p detaching from the cuticle and forming a symmetric invagination. Animals in which the expression of SHOC2wt had been induced at early L3 maintained this pattern. In contrast	 in larvae expressing SHOC2S2G (17/48) or myr::SHOC2wt (10/22)	 descendants of VPCs P5.p and/or P7.p also detached from the cuticle	 resulting in larger and asymmetric invaginations (Fig. 4kâ€“n). This morphogenesis defect was the earliest detectable neomorphic effect of the SHOC2S2G mutation on vulval development.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Consequences of SHOC2S2G expression in C. elegans vulva development We discovered that a SHOC2 mutation promoting N-myristoylation of its protein product causes Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair. This acquired fatty acid modification	 a unique finding for inherited human disease	 results in constitutive membrane targeting	 leading to increased MAPK activation in a cell context-specific manner. Cell-specific RAS pathway activation has also been observed with NS-associated SHP-2 mutants.12â€“14 While not well understood	 this phenomenon explains why	 despite the ubiquitousness of RAS signaling	 development is perturbed in certain tissues in these disorders. It has recent been reported that SHOC2 functions as a regulatory subunit of the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1C)6. By binding GTP-MRAS	 SHOC2 promotes PP1C translocation to the membrane	 allowing PP1C-mediated RAF1 dephosphorylation at residue Ser259	 which is required for stable RAF1 translocation to the plasma membrane and catalytic activation. Of note	 Ser259 and adjacent residues	 which represent a 14-3-3 protein binding site with inhibitory function	 are a major hot spot for NS-causing mutations in RAF1 (Ref. 9). According to this model	 constitutive membrane translocation of the disease-causing SHOC2S2G is expected to promote prolonged PP1C-mediated RAF1 dephosphorylation at Ser259 and	 consequently	 sustained RAF1-stimulated MAPK activation	 which is consistent with our findings.  In C. elegans	 N-myristoylated SHOC2 expression altered morphogenesis during vulval development	 a process for which the involvement of Ras signaling is well established. Specification of VPCs	 however	 was not altered. Rather	 perturbation of the morphogenetic movements of the VPC descendant cells was observed. While numerous mutants altering vulval specification and morphogenesis have been identified	 far less is known about processes affecting only morphogenesis15	16. It is possible that SHOC2S2G alters Ras signaling in steps downstream of the induction of the vulval fate. Alternatively	 SHOC2S2G-induced vulva defects might arise through perturbation of signaling pathways other than Ras-MAPK	 such as signaling mediated by the Rho GTPase	 Rac	 which are critical for vulval morphogenesis17.  A unique feature of the SHOC2 mutation is its association with loose anagen hair. This phenotype occurs in isolation or with NS and has been without molecular cause. Hair shafts from affected individuals show features of the anagen stage of hair follicle development	 during which epithelial stem cells proliferate in the hair bulb18. In this condition	 however	 hair bulbs lack internal and external root sheaths. Our findings suggest perturbation in the proliferation	 survival or differentiation of epithelial stem cell-derived cells residing in hair follicles	 and implicate SHOC2-mediated signal transduction in this aspect of stem cell biology.  Lastly	 we successfully used the human interactome and a network-based statistical method to predict a novel gene for human disease. Our leading candidate	 SHOC2	 was a relatively obscure gene that caused no phenotype when mutated in worms	 evidence of the strength of this approach. For other projects	 one can anticipate that successful candidates will not be deemed this favourable	 necessitating resequencing of many low-probability candidate genes. Emerging interactome datasets and improved analytic methods are likely to enhance the predictive power of systems biology. Noonan syndrome is a heterogenous rasopathy typically presenting with short stature	 characteristic facial features	 cardiac abnormalities including pulmonic valve stenosis	 ASD and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)	 cryptorchidism	 ectodermal abnormalities and learning differences. The phenotype is variable	 and limited genotype phenotype correlation exists with SOS1 mutations often associated with normal cognition and stature	 RAF1 mutations entailing a high HCM risk	 and certain PTPN11 mutations predisposing to juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. The recently identified SHOC2 mutation (p.Ser2Gly) causes Noonan syndrome with loose anagen hair. We report five patients with this mutation. All had skin hyperpigmentation	 sparse light colored hair	 increased fine wrinkles	 ligamentous laxity	 developmental delay and 4/4 had a structural cardiac anomaly. Hypotonia and macrocephaly occurred in 4/5 (80%); 3/5 (60%) had polyhydramnios	 increased birth weight or required use of a feeding tube. Distinctive brain abnormalities included relative megalencephaly and enlarged subarachnoid spaces suggestive of benign external hydrocephalus	 and a relatively small posterior fossa as indicated by a vertical tentorium. The combination of a large brain with a small posterior fossa likely resulted in the high rate of cerebellar tonsillar ectopia (3/4) (75%). Periventricular nodular heterotopia was seen in one patient with a thick and dysplastic corpus callosum. We report on the first hematologic neoplasm	 myelofibrosis	 in a 2-year-old patient with SHOC2 mutation. Myelofibrosis is exceedingly rare in children and young adults. The absence of a somatic JAK2 mutation	 seen in the majority of patients with myelofibrosis	 is noteworthy as it suggests that germline or somatic SHOC2 mutations are causally involved in myelofibrosis.  Keywords: Chiari 1 malformation	 Heterotopia	 Rasopathy	 Noonan syndrome with loose anagen hair	 SHOC2	 malignancy	 myelofibrosis Go to: INTRODUCTION Noonan syndrome was delineated based on its clinical findings of short stature	 characteristic facial features	 wide or webbed neck	 cryptorchidism and congenital heart disease including pulmonic stenosis [for review see Roberts et al.	 2013]. Following the identification of PTPN11 accounting for about half of all patients with Noonan syndrome	 mutations were found in other genes	 with SOS1 and RAF1 more commonly affected than KRAS	 NRAS or CBL [for review see Allanson and Roberts	 2011]. These genes encode proteins interacting within the Ras mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway	 and germline mutations result in dysregulation of this signaling cascade. Syndromic conditions resulting from germline mutations in additional Ras-MAPK protein encoding genes	 for example cardio-facio-cutaneous and Costello syndrome	 share overlapping physical and developmental findings with Noonan syndrome. Despite the phenotypic similarities associated with germline mutations in these genes	 distinctive characteristics are associated with certain genes or mutations	 such as the increased risk for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with RAF1 mutations	 the often normal height with SOS1 mutation	 or the increased risk for juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia with specific PTPN11 mutations. Similarly	 the recently identified SHOC2 mutation	 predicted to result in a p.Ser2Gly amino acid substitution	 causes Noonan syndrome with loose anagen hair. Loose anagen hair presents as easily pluckable	 sparse	 thin and slow growing hair due to an abnormal hair bulb lacking inner and outer root sheaths on microscopy. Only a few patients with the recurrent de novo SHOC2 mutation have been reported	 and the associated phenotype has not been comprehensively assessed [Cordeddu et al.	 2009; Komatsuzaki et al.	 2010; Ekvall et al.	 2011; Hoban et al.	 2012; Capalbo et al.	 2012a].  Go to: MATERIALS AND METHODS In our ongoing clinical and molecular study on Costello syndrome and related disorders	 we enrolled patients with clinical and/or molecular diagnoses of Costello syndrome and related conditions. Laboratory testing for pathogenic mutations is performed	 and newly identified disease causing genes may be analyzed in samples from clinically diagnosed individuals without a molecular diagnosis. Identification of a pathogenic mutation in a proband is followed by testing of both biological parents for the respective change. The study is approved by our institutional review board (A. I. duPont Hospital for Children #2005-051).  Go to: CLINICAL REPORTS Patient 1 (CS# 229; LR13â€“109)  This male was born to his 37-year-old mother and 37-year-old father	 he had two older and one younger sibling and a maternal half-sister. The pregnancy was complicated by polyhydramnios and a cystic hygroma noted during the third trimester (Table I). Amniocentesis had a normal 46	 XY karyotype and a fetal MRI had reportedly normal results. He was born by cesarean at 38-weeks-gestation for macrosomia. His length was 53.3 cm (>90th centile; 50th centile for 1 month); weight 4.16 kg (>90th centile; 50th centile for 1 month) and OFC was not recorded. Apgar values were 8 and 9	 at one and five minutes. Projectile vomiting beginning at age 10 days led to surgical pyloric stenosis repair. Persistent feeding difficulties and severe failure-to-thrive resulted in gastrostomy tube placement at age 5 months. Echocardiography at age 3 months revealed mild pulmonic valve stenosis. The pulmonic valve was mildly thickened and doming. The gradient across the valve had a mean of 7 mm with a peak of 15 mm at rest	 and increased to 34 mm upon agitation and crying. Low muscle tone and unusual eye movement described as â€œeyes rolling back into his headâ€ resulted in neurologic evaluation at age 10 weeks	 and low axial tone was diagnosed. Ophthalmologic evaluation did not reveal structural anomalies or nystagmus	 and brain MRI showed small optic nerves (Table II). Motor development was delayed with pulling to stand at 18 months and cruising at 2 4/12 years. He used words at age 1 year and had about 15 words at 2 4/12 years.  Table I Table I Patient Characteristics Table II Table II Central Nervous System Findings At age 2 3/12 years	 he was diagnosed with possible myeloid leukemia and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia was suspected. A clinical diagnosis of Costello syndrome was proposed. At age 2 4/12 years	 his height was 86.3 cm (10â€“25th centile)	 weight 12.8 kg (10â€“25th centile)	 and OFC 54.3 cm (+3 SD). His anterior fontanel measured 5 Ã— 3 cm and his head was dolichocephalic. His sparse and thin hair was described as â€œvery fineâ€. Eyes showed bilateral mild ptosis and downslanting palpebral fissures (Fig. 1). He had a short neck and narrow shoulders. The abdomen appeared full due to hepatosplenomegaly. Testicles were descended. His skin showed scattered hemangiomata over his right shoulder	 a single hyperpigmented nevus measuring 2 Ã—1 cm on his right knee and numerous fine wrinkles in his hands. His knees appeared hypermobile	 but there was no apparent ligamentous laxity affecting his small joint. Muscle tone was decreased. A detailed neurological and developmental assessment was not possible due to his overall poor health. The patient developed increasing hepatosplenomegaly and blasts in his peripheral blood	 with decreasing red cell counts	 but repeated bone marrow studies were not diagnostic of acute leukemia. He died at age 2 Â½ years after splenectomy in preparation for a bone marrow transplant.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Facial photograph of Patient 1 (A) at age 2 3/12 years	 note sparse hair and very long eyelashes (dolichocilia); tall forehead with mild bitemporal narrowing; downslanting palpebral fissures	 long and deeply grooved philtrum and low-set ears with prominent ... Flow cytometry immunophenotyping was not diagnostic of acute leukemia. Bone marrow biopsies revealed markedly hypercellular marrow with crush artifacts suggestive of fibrosis and marked generalized increase in reticulin staining consistent with myelofibrosis. Karyotype on bone marrow was 46	 XY	 at a 400 band level	 in 30 cells. FISH studies for monosomy 7 had a normal result. Allele specific PCR assay for the JAK2 p.Val617Phe mutation associated with non-CML myeloproliferative disorders on bone marrow derived DNA was negative. All bone marrow study results were most consistent with primary myelofibrosis.  Postmortem testing of stored buccal cell derived DNA performed on a research basis revealed the recurrent SHOC2 c.4A>G mutation. This change was not present in either parentâ€™s buccal cell derived DNA.  Patient 2 (CS#113; LR13â€“110)  This male was the second child born to his 21-year-old mother and a 40-year-old father after a pregnancy complicated by polyhydramnios. Delivery was vaginally at term	 birth weight was 4.14 kg (95th centile). Early severe feeding difficulties and failure-to-thrive prompted a hospitalization at age 3 months	 but no permanent feeding tube was placed. At this time	 weight was 5.05 kg (10â€“25thth centile)	 length 57 cm (10th centile) and OFC 44.5 cm (+2SD). Macrocephaly	 unilateral ptosis	 posteriorly angulated ears	 increased wrinkling of the palms	 loose skin	 bilateral inguinal hernias and hypotonia were noted	 and Costello syndrome was considered. Neurosurgical drainage of presumed bilateral chronic subdural hematomata revealed clear fluid. Echocardiography reportedly had normal results. Bone age was delayed with 4.5 years at chronological age 6 years. The patient had notable intellectual disability with walking independently at age 5 years and reportedly using few single words at 9 years.  At 9 5/12 years	 his height was 125 cm (3rd-5th centile; 50th centile for 7.5 years)	 weight 30.6 kg (50th centile)	 and OFC 56.4 cm (+2SD). His hair was sparse bitemporally and cropped very short. He had mild frontal bossing and his forehead appeared broad and square. Palpebral fissures slanted downward	 and there was mild residual left ptosis. Ears were posteriorly angulated	 slightly prominent and had anteverted lobes. His neck	 chest and back were non dysmorphic. Hands showed deep palmar creases and mild redundancy of the soft tissue	 skin appeared thickened with a thick callus on the knuckles of the left hand. Fingers appeared short and had increased joint laxity. He had pes planus with deep plantar creases and hyperextensible toes	 with the 4th overriding the 3rd toe bilaterally. His genitals appeared normal	 Tanner stage I. Skin was dry	 with a hyperpigmented lesion below his left scapula measuring about 3.5 cm Ã— 1cm; and apparent acanthosis nigricans around his neck. With exception of generalized hypotonia	 his neurologic examination was normal. The patient was friendly	 but non verbal during the examination and wearing a diaper.  Laboratory results included a 46	XY karyotype	 for further studies see Table I.  Patient 3 (CS#134)  This male was born at 36 weeks gestation after a pregnancy complicated by third trimester polyhydramnios	 late diagnosis of gestational diabetes and fetal macrosomia to a 30-year-old mother and a 28-year-old father. Birth weight was 4.36 kg (>90th centile) and length 46 cm (25th centile). He was hospitalized for 48 days due to tracheostenosis	 chronic lung disease and seizure on day-of-life 4. He had right bundle branch block	 and mild to moderate biventricular hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) at age 6 months. A gastrostomy tube was placed at age 16 months for failure-to-thrive. At age 3 years his height was 90 cm (3â€“10th centile)	 weight 15.5 kg (50â€“75th centile) and OFC 57 cm (+4 SD). The combination of HCM	 macrocephaly	 loose appearing skin	 deep palmar creases	 developmental delay and short stature suggested a clinical diagnosis of Costello syndrome. Subsequently	 aortic insufficiency and mild pulmonic stenosis occurred	 and his HCM remained stable. Eczema and dry skin were controlled with lotions.  Patient 3 walked independently at age 24 months and used four words consistently at 30 months. Aggressive behavior began at age 3 Â½ years	 necessitating referral to a behavioral specialist at 5 years	 to a psychiatrist at 6 years	 and hospitalization at 7 years. At age 8 years his developmental level was typical for age 3â€“4 years. He was diagnosed with pervasive developmental disorder and Tourette syndrome at 9 years and continued to use psychotropic medications.  His height was 125 cm (10th centile)	 weight 29.4 kg (50th centile) and OFC 60 cm (+5 SD) at age 9 years. Hair was coarse and straight. Mild ptosis and mildly coarse facial features were noted. A single cafÃ©-au-lait lesion and increased wrinkling of the palms were present. Sudden outbursts of aggression limited the examination.  Patient 4 (LR#12â€“389)  This male was born to a 32-year-old G2P1-2 mother and a 41-year-old father of Mexican ancestry at 37 weeks gestation with a weight of 2.9 kg (50â€“75th centile). At age 4 months he was hospitalized for poor growth (weight was 4.6 kg	 <3rd centile; with height at 3rd and OFC at 5th centile) and bronchiolitis. He had nonsymptomatic elevations of PT/PTT. Physical findings were suggestive of Noonan syndrome	 but molecular analysis was initially non-diagnostic (Table I). Rectal prolapse required surgical repair at age 3 years. Strabismus	 astigmatism and nystagmus were treated with glasses. Chronic ear infections resulted in tube placement. Use of caloric supplements caused dental decay. A persistent foramen ovale and an ASD with trivial mitral valve regurgitation did not require treatment. He had severe eczema and his blond hair grew poorly	 was easily pluggable and significantly lighter in color than his parentsâ€™ and sisterâ€™s. His very long eye lashes were never cut.  Development was globally delayed with walking independently at 2 3/12 years and using words at 1 6/12 years. A formal developmental evaluation at age 4 years resulted in a diagnosis of mild to moderate intellectual disability	 and he had an individualized education plan in school. A brain MRI revealed mild ventriculomegaly and subependymal heterotopia (Fig. 2). Subsequent brain and spinal MRIs performed at 6 years due to headaches revealed development of a Chiari 1 malformation (Table II) in the context of platybasia and basilar invagination	 and segmental fusion of the C3 and C4 vertebrae. Accompanying head MRAs showed mild tortuosity and ectasia of intracranial vertebral and basilary arteries	 and unusual venous anatomy with absent transverse sinuses bilaterally	 large cortical veins emptying directly into the bilateral sigmoid sinuses	 a superior sagittal sinus draining to the right marginal sinus	 and the straight sinus flowing into the occipital sinus. Perfusion images demonstrated normal symmetric cerebral blood flow.  Figure 2 Figure 2 Magnetic resonance images of Patient 4 (LR12-389) at age 15 months (Aâ€“C) and 6 years (Dâ€“I). Midline sagittal images (A	 D) show an unusual posterior cranial and brain configuration characterized by a small posterior fossa	 a sharply angled ... At age 5 5/12 years height was 101 cm; (<3rd centile; 50th centile 3 9/12 years)	 weight 13.9 kg (<3rd centile) and OFC 52.7 cm (about 75th centile). Hair was blonde	 thin and sparse	 and his eye lashes were long. Supraorbital ridges were flat	 resulting in a proptotic appearance. Palpebral fissures showed mild downslant (Fig. 1). Both ears were slightly low-set and posteriorly angulated. The neck was mildly webbed and thoracic kyphosis was mildly increased. Pectus excavatum with hypoplastic and widely spaced appearing nipples (inter nipple distance 14 cm; chest circumference 54 cm) were noted. Increased ligamentous laxity affected the small joints	 and feet were flat. He had increased fine wrinkles in the palms and three cafÃ©-au-lait macules. Neurologic findings included mild hypotonia and brisk deep tendon reflexes.  Patient 5 (LR#12â€“454)  This male was conceived with donor oocytes and his father was 43-year-old at delivery. A cesarian was performed at 38-weeks-gestation due to maternal hypertension. His birth weight was 3345 g (75th centile)	 length 48.3 cm (50th centile) and OFC 35.5 cm (90th centile). His neonatal course was complicated by hypotonia and feeding difficulties	 resulting in naso-gastric feeding tube use until about age 1 year. A patent ductus arteriosus closed after medication treatment. A brain MRI at age 3 weeks (Fig. 3) showed a relatively small cerebellar vermis and hemispheres with prominent fluid spaces above and below the cerebellum	 and increased extra-axial fluid spaces over the frontal lobes and sylvian fissures. The patient received early intervention therapy	 but walked independently at age 14 months. No therapies were provided after age 2 years. At age 8 3/12 years	 his height was 113 cm (<3rd centile; 50th centile for 5 1/2 years)	 weight 19.4 kg (<3rd centile) and OFC 56.1 cm (+2 SD). Facial features are shown in Figure 1	 H-I. He had a wide chest with mild pectus excavatum. He had several small hemangiomata	 and dry and hyperpigmented skin. His hair grew slowly and had never been cut	 and he never had hair loss or easily pluckable hair. He attended school in a typical class with an individualized education plan and occupational therapy for fine motor delay. Attention deficit disorder was treated with medication. Echocardiography showed an abnormal mitral valve with three papillary muscles and redundant mitral valve chordae. There was no obstruction	 and criteria for prolapse were not met.  Figure 3 Figure 3 Magnetic resonance images of Patient 1 (LR13-109) at 12 months (Aâ€“C)	 Patient 2 (LR13-110) at 5 months (Dâ€“F)	 and Patient 5 (LR12-454) at 3 weeks (Gâ€“I)	 and images from a normal child at 3 years (Jâ€“L). Midline sagittal ... Go to: RESULTS Patients 1â€“3 were originally clinically diagnosed with Costello syndrome or a related rasopathy	 resulting in enrollment into our research study. Patient 4 was referred after molecular diagnosis of a SHOC2 mutation	 and Patient 5 was followed clinically for suspected Costello syndrome. Physical	 facial and developmental findings in all patients were consistent with Noonan syndrome with loose anagen hair (Table I); however	 myelofibrosis	 periventricular nodular heterotopia	 vertical tentorium	 and postnatal development of a Chiari 1 malformation have not previously been reported in this condition.  Go to: DISCUSSION Following the identification of the recurrent SHOC2 p.Ser2Gly mutation underlying Noonan syndrome with loose anagen hair	 Cordeddu et al. [2009] found this mutation in 4 of 96 individuals with Noonan syndrome and without a molecular diagnosis. Komatsuzaki et al. [2010] identified 8 SHOC2 mutation positive individuals amongst 92 with Noonan syndrome or a Noonan-like condition and without identified mutation. Assuming no overlap between these case series	 the incidence of a SHOC2 mutation is 12/188	 or about 6%. However	 at least 70% of all Noonan syndrome patients have a mutation in a previously reported gene; thus 6% of the remaining 30% would reflect 1.8% of all individuals with Noonan syndrome. It is noteworthy that Patients 1	2	 3 and 5 in our series were suspected of having Costello syndrome	 a rasopathy sharing phenotypic findings with Noonan syndrome. Costello syndrome is characterized by severe feeding difficulties in infancy	 and feeding tube use was necessary in 3/5 patients reported here. Further	 developmental delay was universally present. Skin findings in the patients reported here were more significant than typical for Noonan syndrome: In addition to the previously reported hyperpigmentation	 the increased fine wrinkles on the palms (Fig. 1) were striking. No patient reported here was formally diagnosed with loose anagen hair	 which requires microscopic analysis of the root sheaths	 but all showed the sparse	 very slow growing hair of unruly texture and unusually light coloring (see blonde hair in Patient 4 of Hispanic ancestry; Fig. 1 B	C). In contrast to the slow growing scalp hair	 all had unusually long eye lashes	 but none requiring trimming of the lashes. This combination of light colored	 slow growing and unruly textured scalp hair with dolichocilia (extremely long eye lashes) is typical for Costello syndrome resulting from an uncommon HRAS change	 p.Gly13Cys [Gripp et al.	 2011]. Interestingly	 individuals with HRAS p. Gly13Cys have less short stature and appear less cognitively impaired than those with the most common Costello syndrome mutation resulting in p.Gly12Ser. Subjectively	 individuals with HRAS p.Gly13Cys and SHOC2 p.Gly2Ser closely resemble each other in their ectodermal	 growth and developmental findings. One might thus anticipate that	 like Patients 1	2	 3 and 5	 additional individuals with a suspected diagnosis of Costello syndrome will have the SHOC2 mutation	 supporting the use of a panel approach to molecular testing in patients with a rasopathy phenotype.  Malignancy in Noonan syndrome  An increased incidence of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) in Noonan syndrome is related to the shared mechanism of PTPN11 missense mutations	 of germline origin in Noonan syndrome and somatic in sporadic JMML [Schubbert et al.	 2005; Schubbert et al.	 2007]. In addition	 reports of neuroblastoma	 acute lymphoblastic leukemia	 low grade glioma and rhabdomyosarcoma result in a cumulative cancer incidence of approximately 4% in individuals with Noonan syndrome by age 20 years [Kratz et al.	 2011]. Patients with a PTPN11 mutation have a cumulative cancer risk of 23% by age 55 years	 a 3.5-fold increase over the general population (95% confidence interval	 2.0â€“5.9)	 based on a study of 297 Dutch Noonan syndrome individuals [Jongmans et al.	 2011].  The Ras/MAPK pathwayâ€™s important primary role in cell differentiation and proliferation permits an equally significant role in carcinogenesis and accounts for the cancer predisposition associated with germline mutations. In this context it is not surprising that we report the first hematologic malignancy in a patient with a SHOC2 mutation. Primary myelofibrosis is classified under the myeloproliferative myeloid neoplasms by the World Health Organization Classification [Tefferi and Vardiman	 2008]. This rare condition affects 1.46/100	000 individuals	 with a mean age at diagnosis of 67 years [Mesa et al.	 1999]. A somatic gain-of-function mutation in JAK2 (p.Val617Phe)	 with secondary loss-of-heterozygosity of the wildtype allele	 can result in myelofibrosis and is present in the majority of patients with myelodysplastic conditions [Kralovics et al.	 2005; Levine et al.	 2007]. Janus kinase 2 is a tyrosine phosphatase involved in early signal transduction after membrane bound receptor activation. The p.Val617Phe substitution results in constitutive activation of the abnormal protein product. While the activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) is the best recognized target of JAKs	 they also recruit and activate other molecules involved in signal transduction	 including the Ras/MAPK and the PI3K pathway [for review see Rane and Reddy	 2000]. This interrelatedness of the JAK and Ras-MAPK pathway may be the biological mechanism behind the overlapping myelodysplastic conditions associated with mutations resulting in constitutive activation of either pathway. The absence of the common JAK2 mutation in Patient 1 is noteworthy and suggests that the SHOC2 mutation may have been the predisposing change for myelofibrosis. Similarly	 germline mutations in CBL result in a Noonan syndrome phenotype [Martinelli et al.	 2010] with predisposition to JMML [Niemeyer et al.	 2010]	 whereas the more common somatic CBL mutations are seen in myelodysplastic syndromes [Schwaab et al.	 2012].  Extramedullary hematopoiesis resulted in a thoracic mass in a 1-month-old with a de novo SHOC2 and a familial PTPN11 p.Gly409Ala mutation [Ekvall et al.	 2011]. This patient also had a surgically removed spinal neuroblastoma. No further information on the neuroblastoma or the extramedullary hematopoiesis was provided at the patientâ€™s age of 11 years [Ekvall et al.	 2011]. Leukocytosis was noted in a premature infant [Hoban et al.	 2012] and a 5-year-old without an obvious infection [Komatsuzaki et al.	 2010]	 but no somatic SHOC2 mutation has been reported in hematologic malignancies. Komatsuzaki et al. [2010] did not identify a SHOC2 mutation in leukemic cells from 82 patients. We suggest to study JAK2 mutation negative myelofibrosis cases for SHOC2 p.Ser2Gly.  Structural brain anomalies  Few reports of structural brain findings in SHOC2 mutation patients are available	 and the information provided is limited. Brain imaging studies in children with SHOC2 mutations (Table II) demonstrate two distinct abnormalities: Relative megalencephaly and small posterior fossa. First	 most patients had short stature and macrocephaly after birth	 which supports a relative megalencephaly as observed in other rasopathies such as Costello syndrome [Gripp et al.	 2010]. All patients had mildly enlarged subarachnoid spaces	 especially over the frontal region	 which appears most consistent with "benign external hydrocephalus". This poorly understood disorder is seen in children with macrocephaly between 6 and 18 months of age	 and largely resolves thereafter [Zahl et al.	 2011]. The two patients with the most striking subarachnoid space enlargement	 Patients 2 and 4	 were scanned at age 1 year	 and subsequent scans in Patient 4 demonstrated partial resolution. Benign external hydrocephalus is commonly associated with ventriculomegaly and mildly reduced white matter volume	 also seen in the patients reported here. Benign arachnoid cysts were present in Patient 4 (Fig. 2) and specifically commented upon in the patient with SHOC2 and PTPN11 mutation reported by Ekvall et al. [2011].  Second	 all four patients had relatively small posterior fossa size as indicated by the vertical tentorium	 and Patient 4 had a vertical splenium of the corpus callosum as well. The combination of relative megalencephaly and small posterior fossa likely resulted in Patient 4â€™s postnatal development of a Chiari I malformation. Mazzanti et al. [2003] reported a patient in whom an MRI performed at age 2 5/12 years showed hydrocephalus requiring shunt placement	 but a Chiari 1 malformation was first seen at age 4 1/12 years	 also suggesting a postnatally developed anomaly. Adding the patient in whom a MRI obtained at age 9 years revealed a Chiari 1 malformation [Capalbo et al. 2012b]	 3/8 patients in whom MRIs were obtained had a Chiari 1. The high rate of cerebellar tonsillar ectopia	 defined as downward displacement of the tonsils into the low posterior fossa	 and Chiari 1 malformation is not surprising given the combination of a large brain (relative megalencephaly) and small posterior fossa.  Due to limited data on the previously reported patients	 Chiari 1 may be underascertained in SHOC2 mutation positive individuals. In addition to several single case reports of Chiari 1 in Noonan syndrome [Ball and Peiris	 1982; Holder-Espinasse and Winter	 2003; Galarza et al.	 2010; Massimi et al.	 2011; Keh et al.	 2013] and the allelic Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines [Beier et al.	 2009]	 Smpokou et al. [2012] found self-reported Chiari 1 malformation in 7/35 (20%) of adolescents or adults with Noonan syndrome	 supporting an increased incidence compared to the general population. While Chiari 1 malformation has rarely been reported in patients with CFC syndrome [Gripp et al.	 2010]	 other structural abnormalities	 delayed myelination and brain atrophy as well as seizures have been reported more commonly [Yoon et al.	 2007; Papadopoulou et al.	 2011; Adachi et al.	 2012]. Periventricular nodular heterotopia had not been reported in patients with SHOC2 mutation	 and does not appear to be common in rasopathies.  Physical and behavioral findings in this cohort  In addition to the CNS findings and the malignancy discussed above	 physical findings not typically seen in Noonan syndrome include the pyloric stenosis	 chronic lung disease and rectal prolapse (Table I). Since each finding occurred in a single patient	 they may be coincidental. However	 pyloric stenosis is more common in Costello syndrome than in the general population [Gripp et al.	 2008]	 as reviewed following the identification of a patient with an unusual HRAS mutation	 pyloric stenosis and severe behavior problems requiring medication [Gripp et al.	 2008; Gripp et al. 2012]. Severe behavior problems requiring psychotropic medication are uncommon in Costello and Noonan syndrome	 but were present in one patient reported here as well.  In conclusion	 we report structural brain abnormalities including benign external hydrocephalus	 relative megalencephaly and small posterior fossa	 postnatally developed Chiari 1 malformation and heterotopia with SHOC2 mutation. We report the first myeloproliferative malignancy	 myelofibrosis	 in a SHOC2 mutation positive individual. In the absence of the common somatic JAK2 mutation this suggests activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway as an alternative initiating step towards myeloproliferative disorders. We subjectively noted facial and ectodermal features resembling those of individuals with Costello syndrome	 in particular due to HRAS p.Gly13Cys. The well recognized overlap of phenotypic findings amongst the rasopathies supports the use of gene panel based molecular diagnostic testing.  																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	
4	27||Heterozygous mutations in the telomerase components TERT	 the reverse transcriptase	 and TERC	 the RNA template	 cause autosomal dominant dyskeratosis congenita due to telomere shortening. Anticipation	 whereby the disease severity increases in succeeding generations due to inheritance of shorter telomeres	 is a feature of this condition. Here we describe 2 families in which 2 TERT mutations are segregating. Both families contain compound heterozygotes. In one case the proband is homozygous for a novel mutation causing a P704S substitution	 while his father's second allele encodes an H412Y mutation. The proband in the second family has mutant alleles Y846C and H876Q. Transfection studies show codominant expression of the mutated alleles with no evidence of a dominant negative effect or of intragenic complementation. Thus in these families the expression of both TERT alleles and the inherited telomere length contribute to the clinical phenotype.  Go to: Introduction Mutations in genes encoding components of the telomerase ribonucleoprotein complex resulting in very short telomeres have been identified in patients with dyskeratosis congenita (DC)	 a rare inherited bone marrow failure syndrome.1â€“6 X-linked DC is caused by mutations in the DKC1 gene	 encoding a protein necessary for the stabilization of the TERC RNA. Individuals with autosomal dominant DC (AD DC) are heterozygous for mutations in the telomerase RNA TERC or the gene encoding the catalytic subunit TERT.2â€“5 In contrast to patients with X-linked DC	 who usually develop severe disease with a high penetrance	 disease penetrance and expressivity in AD DC are highly variable and	 in addition to the gene mutation	 the inheritance of short telomeres is required for the manifestation of the disease.7	8 Here we demonstrate that the inheritance of AD DC may be complex. We report a DC patient homozygous for a TERT mutation and compound heterozygotes in 2 separate families with apparent codominance of the 2 mutations  Go to: Methods Clinical and genetic information was obtained through our ongoing study on the molecular mechanisms of bone marrow failure (http://bmf.im.wustl.edu). The study is approved by the Washington University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board. Informed consent was obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. DNA for mutation analysis was extracted from peripheral blood cells (Qiagen	 Valencia	 CA). Telomere length measurements in peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC) by flow-FISH and direct DNA sequencing were previously described.8 Primers used are shown in Table S1 (available on the Blood website; see the Supplemental Materials link at the top of the online article).  The mutations identified were introduced in the p3.1+ TERT plasmid9 using the QuickChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene	 La Jolla	 CA). Wild-type (WT) or mutant TERT plasmid (4 Î¼g) were transfected into WI-38 VA-13 cells at 80% confluence in the presence of an equal amount of pUC TERC using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen	 Carlsbad	 CA).10 In cotransfection experiments	 2 Î¼g of each mutant TERT plasmid were used. Thirty-six hours after transfection	 telomerase activities were determined in cell lysates at protein concentrations of 40	10	2.5	 and 0.625 ng using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR)â€“based TRAP assay as previously described.11  Go to: Results and discussion Figure 1A shows the pedigrees of families 199 and 284. Patient 199.1 is a 31-year-old man of Scottish descent. His clinical manifestations include short stature; elfin appearance; esophageal stricture; leukoplakia of the buccal mucosa	 anus	 and penis; abnormal pigmentation of his neck	 trunk	 and back; hyperkeratosis of his palms; ridged fingernails; avascular necrosis of both hips; tooth loss; chronic diarrhea; learning difficulties; pulmonary infiltrates; and progressive bone marrow failure (Figure 1B). His 61-year-old father was diagnosed with osteoporosis at the age of 60. His 60-year-old mother is healthy. Both parents have normal peripheral blood cell counts. The paternal grandmother (age	 84 years) has a history of anemia	 osteoporosis	 and pulmonary fibrosis. The maternal grandmother was reported to have died at the age of 60 years because of pulmonary fibrosis.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Pedigrees and clinical manifestations in TERT mutations (A) Pedigrees and identified TERT gene mutations in families 199 and 284. Circles	 females; squares	 males; white	 wild type; color	 mutant as indicated in the chart. Half-filled symbols indicate ... Mutation analysis revealed that patient 199.1 is homozygous for a C to T transition in exon 5 of the TERT gene (cDNA nt C2110T) causing a proline to serine substitution at amino acid 704 (P704S). Functional analysis in WI-38 VA-13 cells demonstrated that the TERT P704S mutation severely reduces telomerase activity to 13% of normal (P < .001; Figure 2A). Both parents are heterozygous for the TERT P704S mutation (Figure 1A). Interestingly	 however	 the father carries a second TERT mutation in exon 2. This C1234T mutation (H412Y)	 has been previously described in an unrelated family.3 This mutation reduced telomerase activity to 36% of normal in our transfection experiments (P < .001; Figure 2A). Coexpression of WT TERT with either the P704S or H412Y variants did not show evidence of a dominant negative effect. The coexpression of the 2 TERT mutations resulted in an intermediate telomerase activity of 22% (P < .001; Figure 2B)	 suggesting a synergic effect on telomerase activity and no intragenic complementation. Careful analysis of the family tree revealed that the parents are fourth cousins	 explaining the presence of the TERT P704S mutation in both parents.  Figure 2 Figure 2 Telomerase activity and telomere lengths of wild-type and mutant individuals. (A) In vitro telomerase activity of the mutant TERT proteins in WI-38 VA-13 cells. WI-38 VA-13 cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing the mutant TERT cDNA sequences ... Telomere length measurement in family 199 revealed that patient 199.1 has very short telomeres (below the 1st percentile of the normal telomere length distribution; Figure 2C). Interestingly	 the father (199.2)	 who is compound heterozygous for the TERT P704S and H412Y mutations	 has also very short telomeres	 whereas the mother (199.3)	 who is heterozygous for TERT P704S mutation	 has a normal telomere length.  Patient 284.1 is an 8-year-old girl of European descent	 originally diagnosed with moderate but progressive aplastic anemia. Both of her parents are healthy with no abnormalities in the peripheral blood. Family history was negative for blood diseases	 pulmonary fibrosis	 or cancer.  Mutation analysis revealed 2 different TERT gene sequence alterations. The A2537G in exon 9 (Y846C) and C2628G mutation in exon 10 (H876Q). Further analysis showed that the TERT Y846C mutation was inherited from the mother	 whereas the TERT H876Q mutation was inherited from her father	 indicating that patient 284.1 is a compound heterozygote for the 2 TERT gene mutations (Figure 1A). Both TERT gene mutations result in a significantly reduced telomerase activity after transfection into WI-38 VA-13 cells to 10% (P < .001) and 50% (P < .001) of normal (Figure 2A)	 whereas the cotransfection of the 2 mutants results in a telomerase activity of 38% (P = .004; Figure 2B).  Telomere length in peripheral blood cells from patient 284.1 was very short	 below the 1st percentile of normal and so were those measured in her mother (284.2) and in one of her uncles (284.4)	 both of whom carry the TERT Y846C mutation. Telomere length in her father (284.3) heterozygous for the TERT H876Q mutation was between the 1st and 5th percentile of normal (Figure 2C).  In conclusion	 we have identified 3 novel and 1 recurrent TERT gene mutation in 2 families who were thought to have sporadic DC and idiopathic aplastic anemia. All 4 mutations are hypomorphic mutations	 impairing	 but not eliminating telomerase activity. Homozygous hypomorphic TERT mutations have recently been found to cause disease in 2 consanguineous families.12 Here we demonstrate that in a nonconsanguineous family compound heterozygosity for TERT can cause disease and that the involvement of TERT in the pathogenesis of DC is probably more complex than initially anticipated. Our data indicate that in compound heterozygosity or homozygosity for hypomorphic TERT mutations the mutant alleles are codominant and suggest that severity of telomerase dysfunction and the inheritance of short telomeres determine the clinical phenotype and onset of disease. Codominant inheritance has also been found in one family with 2 hypomorphic TERC gene mutations	13 whereas compound heterozygosity or homozygosity for TERC or TERT null mutations have never been reported	 suggesting that in humans	 in contrast to mice	 biallelic TERC or TERT null mutations are probably not compatible with life. The consideration that both sides of the family may be affected even in nonconsanguineous families might have important implications for the patient in the selection of a potential sibling donor as well as for the prognosis and management of other family members carrying one or 2 of the identified gene mutations.  																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																
7	28||Sequencing studies have identified many recurrent coding mutations in human cancer genes; however	 highly recurrent mutations involving regulatory regions have rarely been observed. Here we describe two independent mutations within the TERT core promoter that	 when taken together	 were observed in 71% (50 of 70) of melanomas and generate de novo consensus ETS binding motifs. Reporter assays showed that these mutations increase transcriptional activity from the TERT promoter by 2â€“4-fold. Examination of cancer cell lines derived from diverse tumor types revealed the same mutations in 16% (24 of 150) of cases	 with preliminary evidence of elevated frequency in bladder and hepatocellular cancer cells. Thus	 somatic mutations in regulatory regions of the genome may represent an important tumorigenic mechanism.  Systematic characterization of human cancer genomes has led to the discovery of a wide range of mutated genes that contribute to tumor development and progression. Most of the somatic mutations in tumors reside within the protein-coding regions of genes or at splice junctions. To determine whether tumor genomes harbor recurrent mutations outside of protein-coding regions	 we systematically queried noncoding somatic mutations using published whole-genome sequencing data.  Analysis of whole-genome sequencing data from malignant melanomas (1	 2) revealed two somatic telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene promoter mutations in 17 of 19 (89%) cases examined. The average sequence coverage at the TERT promoter locus was 30-fold in normal samples and 60-fold in tumor samples (fig. S1A). Each of these promoter mutations resulted in a cytidine-to-thymidine transition at a dipyrimidine motif indicative of ultraviolet (UV) lightâ€“induced damage (chr5	1	295	228 C>T and 1	295	250 C>T; hereafter termed C228T and C250T	 respectively)	 and both mutations localized within 100 base pairs (bp) of the TERT transcriptional start site (TSS) (mean allelic fraction	 0.32; range	 0.07 to 0.55) (table S1). We validated these mutations by means of polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing tumor/normal sample pairs from both the discovery set (Fig. 1A and fig. S1	 B and C) and an extension set of 51 additional melanoma tumor/normal sample pairs. Within this extension set	 33 tumors (65%) harbored one of the mutations. Moreover	 the mutations were mutually exclusive in both the discovery and extension sets (P = 5.4 Ã— 10âˆ’7	 Fisherâ€™s one-sided exact test). Two tumors with a C228T transition also contained an adjacent C>T transition (at position chr5	1	295	229)	 which is indicative of a dinucleotide CC>TT transition. Together	 these TERT promoter mutations were observed in 50 of 70 (71%; 95% confidence interval: 59 to 82%	 Clopper-Pearson method) melanomas examined (Fig. 1B and table S1).  Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Identification of TERT promoter mutations in melanoma and cancer cell lines Both C228T and C250T generated an identical 11-bp nucleotide stretch (5â€²-CCCCTTCCGGG-3â€²) containing a consensus binding site for E-twenty-six (ETS) transcription factors (GGAA	 reverse complement) within the TERT promoter region. Because ETS transcription factors may become activated through dysregulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) signaling	 we hypothesized that these promoter mutations might augment gene expression. To test this hypothesis	 we used a reporter assay system in which the relevant portion of the mutant or wild-type TERT core promoter was cloned upstream of the firefly luciferase gene (2). Here	 we tested both a core promoter fragment (âˆ’132 to +5 relative to the TSS) and the full core promoter (âˆ’200 to +73). In comparison to the wild-type TERT promoter	 both mutations conferred approximately two- to fourfold increased transcriptional activity in five distinct cell line contexts (Fig. 1C and fig. S1D). Thus	 each mutation was capable of augmenting transcriptional activity from the TERT promoter.  To investigate whether similar TERT promoter mutations occur in other cancer types	 we examined sequencing data from this locus in 150 cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) (3). Overall	 24 CCLE lines (16%) contained either C228T or C250T (mean allelic fraction	 0.61; range	 0.17 to 1.00) (table S1). An increased frequency in melanoma was again noted (five of six lines tested)	 with additional evidence suggesting possible heightened prevalence (>25%; one-sided 95% confidence interval) in bladder (three of three lines) and hepatocellular cancer cell lines (four of six lines) (Fig. 1D).  Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that these promoter mutations may function as driver events that contribute to oncogenesis through TERT dysregulation and undergo positive selection	 at least in human melanoma. First	 the TERT promoter mutations showed a combined frequency that exceeded those of BRAF and NRAS mutations	 which activate known melanoma driver oncogenes (4	 5). In an analysis restricted to somatic mutations present at an allelic fraction of 0.2 or greater [to reduce artifacts of mutation calling (1)]	 the four most recurrent melanoma nucleotide substitutions included BRAF [chr7	140	453	136 A>T (V600E)]	 NRAS [chr1	115	256	529 T>C (Q61R)]	 and the TERT core promoter mutations C228T and C250T. Second	 although highly recurrent	 C228T and C250T occurred in a wholly mutually exclusive fashion. This suggests the possibility that the mutations might be functionally redundant. Third	 the absence of other recurrent somatic mutations in the 3 kb upstream of the TERT transcription start site in the queried melanomas (1) coupled with the absence of the described TERT promoter mutations in 24 lung adenocarcinomas with comparably high somatic mutation rates (6) reduces the possibility that these recurrent TERT promoter mutations are solely due to an increased background mutation rate at this locus. Although the role of telomerase in tumorigenesis is well established	 details regarding its dysregulation in cancer cells remain incompletely understood	 particularly in melanoma (7). The TERT promoter mutations identified here may link telomerase gene regulation and tumorigenic activation in this malignancy. The high prevalence of C228T and C250T suggests that these TERT promoter mutations may comprise early genetic events in the genesis of melanoma and other cancer types. Although TERT expression alone is not sufficient to bypass oncogene-induced senescence	 genomic TERT activation may potentiate mechanisms by which melanocytes achieve immortalization in the setting of oncogenic mutations (8). These results therefore suggest that renewed efforts to develop clinically effective telomerase inhibitors may be warranted.  At the same time	 promoter mutations likely represent only one potential mechanism of TERT reactivation in a subset of human cancers. Indeed	 recurrent chromosomal copy gains spanning the TERT locus have been described previously for several cancers	 including melanoma (9	 10).  Highly recurrent somatic mutations within a cancer gene promoter region have not previously been described. Similarly	 the de novo mutational generation of transcription factor binding motifs in tumor genomes was heretofore unknown	 although an ETS transcription factor binding motif was previously associated with a single-nucleotide polymorphism insertion at the MMP-1 locus (11). Together	 these findings raise the possibility that recurrent somatic mutations involving regulatory regions	 in addition to coding sequences	 may represent important driver events in cancer.

We investigated a melanoma-prone family through linkage analysis and high-throughput sequencing and identified a disease-segregating germline mutation in the promoter of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene	 which encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase. The mutation creates a new binding motif for Ets transcription factors and ternary complex factors (TCFs) near the transcription start and	 in reporter gene assays	 caused up to twofold increase in transcription. We then screened the TERT promoter in sporadic melanoma and observed recurrent ultraviolet signature somatic mutations in 125 of 168 (74%) of human cell lines derived from metastatic melanomas	 45 of 53 corresponding metastatic tumor tissues (85%)	 and 25 of 77 (33%) primary melanomas. The majority of those mutations occurred at two positions in the TERT promoter and also generated binding motifs for Ets/TCF transcription factors. The identification of germline mutations that cosegregate with disease in cancerprone families often provides genetic and mechanistic insights into the more common	 sporadically arising cancers. In a study of cutaneous melanoma	 the most malignant skin cancer	 we investigated a large pedigree with 14 related melanoma patients who were not carriers of germline mutations in CDKN2A or CDK4	 two known melanoma genes (Fig. 1). Multipoint linkage analysis showed a possible 2.2-Mb linkage region on chromosome 5p with maximal logarithm of the odds ratio for linkage scores of 2.35 at rs1379917 and 2.45 at rs1968011. Target-enriched high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of the region was carried out on constitutional DNA from the four affected and four unaffected members of the family with an average coverage between 55- and 108-fold (table S1) (1). The HTS data revealed a single promoter variant	 three intronic variants	 and three nongene variants previously unknown and unique to the DNA sequences of the affected individuals (table S2). The disease segregating variants	 seven in total	 were validated by Sanger sequencing of DNA from the individuals sequenced by HTS and of DNA from additional unaffected members of the family. The new variants were also detected in an unaffected member (754	 table S3)	 who was 36 years old and carried multiple nevi. DNA from affected individuals other than those sequenced by HTS was not available for testing. Of the seven unique variants identified	 one variant (T>G)	 was located in the promoter at â€“57 base pairs (bp) from ATG translation start site of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT ) gene. The TERT gene encodes the catalytic reverse transcriptase subunit of telomerase	 the ribonucleoprotein complex that maintains telomere length. The nucleotide change in the sequence CCTGAA>CCGGAA creates a new binding motif for Ets transcription factors	 with a general recognition motif GGA(A/T). Beyond the general motif for Ets transcription factors	 the familial mutation also generates a binding motif	 CCGGAA	 for the ternary complex factors (TCFs) Elk1 and Elk4 (2	 3). To exclude the possibility that the detected promoter mutation in TERT is a common germline variant	 we screened germline DNA from 140 sporadic melanoma cases and 165 healthy controls	 and none carried the variant. Screening of DNA from index cases from 34 Spanish melanoma families also did not show any mutations. No carriers were found in dbSNP and the 1000 Genomes databases (data available for 18 individuals were obtained from Ensembl). The familial mutation in the TERT promoter was in complete allelic linkage with a common polymorphism rs2853669 (G>A) at â€“246 bp upstream from the ATG start site (table S3). In previous work	 this polymorphism was reported to disrupt an Ets binding site	 and it was associated with low telomerase activity in patients with nonâ€“ small cell lung cancer (4). In luciferase reporter gene assays	 we found that the activity of constructs containing the mutation at â€“57 bp of the TERT promoter was increased 1.5-fold and 1.2- fold over the wild-type construct in Ma-Mel-86a and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells	 respectively. A construct with both the TERT mutation and the variant allele of the rs2853669 polymorphism showed a 2.2-fold increase in promoter activity in Ma-Mel-86a and and 1.3-fold increase in HEK293 cells (mean from three measurements; details in supplementary text and fig. S1). The germline occurrence of the promoter mutation	 creating an Ets/TCF motif	 can result in modification of TERT expression in all tissues expressing Ets/TCF. Highest staining for the TCF Elk1 protein has been reported in female-specific tissues	 such as ovary and placenta. The increased expression of TCF Elk1 protein in female-specific tissues may cause gender-related differences in 1 Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology	 German Cancer Research Center	 Im Neuenheimer Feld 580	 69120 Heidelberg	 Germany. 2 Department of Dermatology	 University Hospital Essen	 45122 Essen	 Germany. 3 Institute of Human Genetics	 University of Heidelberg	 69120 Heidelberg	 Germany. 4 Department of Dermatology	 Instituto Valenciano de Oncologia	 Valencia	 Spain. 5 Center for Primary Health Care Research	 Lund University	 MalmÃ¶	 Sweden. *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Two affected members of the family developed several different types of cancer (marked with # in Fig. 1). One affected individual presented with ovarian cancer at age 27 and melanoma at age 30. Another individual was diagnosed with melanoma at age 20; later she developed ovarian cancer	 renal cell carcinoma	 bladder cancer	 mammary carcinoma	 and finally bronchial carcinoma	 leading to her death at age 50. The mutation in the melanoma-prone family prompted us to screen melanoma cell lines derived from sporadic cases of metastatic melanoma. None of the cell lines carried the mutation detected in the family. However	 we identified recurrent ultraviolet (UV)â€“signature mutations in the TERT core promoter in 74% (125 of 168) of the cell lines. The mutations were located within a 49-bp region starting from â€“100 bp upstream of the ATG start site (Table 1	 Fig. 2	 fig. S2	 and table S4). There were two frequent mutations at â€“124 bp (G>A; C>T on opposite strand) and â€“146 bp (G>A); these mutations were mutually exclusive and occurred in 27 and 38% of cell lines	 respectively. Two tandem GG>AA (CC>TT) mutations at positions â€“124/â€“125 bp and â€“138/â€“139 bp were observed at a frequency of 9%. The tandem mutation at positions â€“138/â€“139 bp could also be generated by a single-base mutation at â€“138 bp	 because the base change at â€“139 bp has been reported as a rare polymorphism (rs35550267). The two most frequent single-base mutations as well as the two tandem mutations also result in the creation of Ets/TCF binding motifs. Mutations were confirmed in 45 of 53 (85%) available metastasized tumors corresponding to the cell lines. The somatic nature of the mutations was shown by the absence of mutations in corresponding DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells available from 23 patients. Somatic mutations in the TERT promoter were more frequent than the BRAF mutations (53%	 90 of 169)	 CDKN2A alterations (50%	 84 of 169)	 and NRAS mutations (23%	 38 of 169; fig. S3). The occurrence of concomitant mutations in the TERT promoter and BRAF was more frequent (47%) than by random chance (40%) with an odds ratio (OR) of 3.2 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3 to 8.2]. Concomitant mutations in TERT	 BRAF	 and CDKN2Awere observed in 30% of cell lines compared with the expected frequency of such occurrence of 9% (OR 5.6	 95% CI 2.4 to 13.8). The high recurrence and specificity of the TERT promoter mutations	 together with the preliminary evidence from reporter assays that they have a functional effect on transcription	 suggest that these mutations are driver rather than passenger events. Extensive functional studies will be required to validate this hypothesis. The TERT promoter mutations were also detected in 25 out of 77 (33%) paraffin embedded primary melanoma tumors (Table 1 and table S5) at â€“124 bp (7/77; 9%) and â€“146 bp (5/77; 7%). Four primary tumors carried the GG>AA tandem mutations at â€“124/â€“125 bp	 and eight primary tumors carried the GG>AA tandem mutations at â€“138/â€“139 bp. Reduced sensitivity to detect mutations in paraffin-embedded primary tumors because of contaminating normal cells cannot be ruled out. Primary tumors harbored five additional mutations in the TERT promoter	 which were not present in metastases	 and those did not generate Ets/TCF binding motifs. We also screened DNA extracted from 25 melanocytic nevi and only one carried a mutation at â€“101 bp	 which did not create an Ets/TCF motif. For both primary tumors and melanocytic nevi	 matched normal control DNA was not available for testing. The TERT coding region has been reported to be somatically mutated in 1% of cancers (14 cancer types	 1271 unique samples) (6). Mutations creating Ets/TCF binding motifs in the TERT promoter in melanoma have not been described in earlier sequencing projects. TCFs are a subfamily of Ets transcription factors; two members of this subfamily	 Elk1 and Elk4	 are downstream targets of BRAF and regulate the expression of many genes (7â€“11). Conceivably	 TCF may represent a link between telomerase activity and the frequent BRAF activating mutations in melanoma (fig. S4) (12	 13). Lastly	 whether TERT promoter mutations occur in other cancer types remains to be determined. We did not detect these mutations in a screen of 22 esophageal squamous cell c  Reactivation of telomerase has been implicated in human tumorigenesis	 but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we report the presence of recurrent somatic mutations in the TERT promoter in cancers of the central nervous system (43%)	 bladder (59%)	 thyroid (follicular cell-derived	 10%) and skin (melanoma	 29%). In thyroid cancers	 the presence of TERT promoter mutations (when occurring together with BRAF mutations) is significantly associated with higher TERT mRNA expression	 and in glioblastoma we find a trend for increased telomerase expression in cases harbouring TERT promoter mutations. Both in thyroid cancers and glioblastoma	 TERT promoter mutations are significantly associated with older age of the patients. Our results show that TERT promoter mutations are relatively frequent in specific types of human cancers	 where they lead to enhanced expression of telomerase.

Reactivation or re-expression of telomerase is referred to be a widespread feature in human cancers	 although the genetic basis remains poorly understood in many cancer types. Somatic mutations in the coding region of TERT (human telomerase reverse transcriptase) are infrequent in human tumours	 but germline and somatic mutations in TERT promoter were recently found in a high percentage of human melanomas and human cancer cell lines1	2. Such mutations occurred in two hotspot positions	 located  124 and  146 bp upstream from the ATG start site (  124 G4A and  146 G4A	 C4T on opposite strand) and conferred enhanced TERT promoter activity1	2	 by putatively generating a consensus binding site (GGAA) for ETS transcription factors within the TERT promoter region1	2. Our aim was to investigate whether the aforementioned TERT promoter mutations were present in cancer types other than melanoma	 having for that matter screened 741 primary tumours from the thyroid	 kidney	 bladder	 gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST)	 adrenal medulla (phaeochromocytomas) and central nervous system (CNS). Besides skin melanoma	 we have also included ocular melanoma (not studied in the previous reports)	 benign lesions of the thyroid and skin and 58 human cancer-derived cell lines. Our results highlight TERT promoter mutations as frequent events in specific types of human cancers. Results TERT mutations in tumours and cell lines. Overall	 TERT promoter mutations were found in 142 (19%) human tumour samples (Table 1; Fig. 1a) and 14 (24%) human cell lines (Fig. 1b; Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). The  124-bp mutation was the most frequent	 being present in 99 cases	 whereas the  146- bp mutation was present in 43 cases. The  124 G4A and  146 G4A mutations were found in a mutually exclusive fashion. Two tandem GG4AA mutations at positions  124/  125 and  138/  139 bp were observed in one cell line each (Supplementary Fig. S1 and Supplementary Table S1). TERT promoter mutations were not detected in normal thyroid tissue nor in benign lesions (nevi	 thyroiditis	 goitres and adenomas). No mutations were detected in 26 kidney cancers	 17 phaeochromocytomas and 36 GISTs. TERT mutations in melanoma. We have analysed both skin and ocular melanomas	 a type of melanoma that was not previously studied1	2. TERT mutations were present in 16 out of 56 (29%) skin melanomas	 but absent in the 25 ocular melanomas (Table 1). All the four skin melanoma-derived cell lines but none of the six ocular melanoma-derived cell lines harboured TERT mutations (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table S1). Ten out of 16 (63%) skin melanomas with TERT mutation also harboured the BRAFV600E mutation	 whereas the BRAF mutation was present in 9 out of 38 (24%) melanomas without TERT mutation (P Â¼ 0.01	 Fisherâ€™s exact test	 two-sided) (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Supplementary Table S3). TERT mutations in CNS tumours. In CNS tumours	 TERT promoter mutations were found in 43% (51/118) of all cases with an equal prevalence of both mutations (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S4). The frequency of TERT mutations was different according to the tumour histology and grade (Fig. 1c): although pilocytic astrocytomas (World Health Organization (WHO) grade 1) and diffuse astrocytoma (WHO grade 2) showed a lower frequency of mutations (8% and 15%	 respectively)	 the most aggressive form	 glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; WHO grade 4)	 present the highest frequency of TERT mutations (62%). Oligodendrogliomas (WHO grade 2) and anaplastic oligodendrogliomas (WHO grade 3) also harboured a high frequency of TERT mutations (45% and 54%	 respectively). The presence of TERT mutations was significantly associated with a higher mean age at diagnosis (Supplementary Table S5) in CNS patients as a whole (Po0.0001; Mannâ€“Whitney test	 twotailed) and also in GBM patients only (P Â¼ 0.0247; Mannâ€“ Whitney test	 two-tailed); in oligodendroglioma patients	 we found the same trend	 although not statistically significant (P Â¼ 0.0709; Mannâ€“Whitney test	 two-tailed). In addition	 we observed that	 in a subset of 14 GBM (8 TERT wild-type tumours and 6 TERT-mutated tumours)	 the tumours with TERT mutations showed a trend to increased immunohistochemistry (IHC) expression of telomerase	 although this difference was not statistically significant (P Â¼ 0.4250; Mannâ€“Whitney test	 two-tailed) (Fig. 2). TERT mutations in thyroid cancer. We analysed a large series of follicular cell-derived thyroid samples including normal thyroid (n Â¼ 27)	 benign (n Â¼ 81) and malignant lesions (n Â¼ 263) (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S6). TERT mutations were only detected in malignant tumours (10%) (Fig. 1d)	 namely in Table 1 | Prevalence of TERT promoter recurrent mutations in human cancers.

Within the group of PTC	 TERT mutations were detected to be associated to the so-called conventional PTC (cPTC) (11%).The majority of TERT-mutated thyroid cancers harboured the  124 G4A mutation (22 out of 27 cases) (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Table S7).

In bladder cancer	 TERT mutations were frequently detected (48/82; 59%) both in lowgrade tumours (14/21; 67%) and high-grade tumours (34/61; 56%) (Table 1 and Fig. 1e; Supplementary Table S9). The  124 G4A mutation was present in 30 cases	 whereas the  146 G4A was found in 18 cases. No association was found between the presence of the mutation and the age of the patients. No mutations were detected in 26 kidney cancers	 17 phaeochromocytoma and 36 GISTs (Supplementary Tables S10	 S11 and S12	 respectively). Discussion Recent findings have described that TERT promoter mutations arise as a novel mechanism of telomerase reactivation/expression in human cancers1	2. In this work	 we report for the first time the presence of these mutations in different histotypes of thyroid cancer	 and our results validate the findings reported by others in melanoma	 bladder and gliomas1â€“3. Furthermore	 we present for the first time evidence showing that TERT promoter mutations are significantly associated with increased TERT mRNA expression in thyroid cancers. We also found a trend for increased telomerase expression in cases of GBM harbouring TERT promoter mutations. In thyroid cancers	 TERT mRNA was particularly high in cases harbouring both TERT and BRAF mutations. The location of these mutations in the TERT promoter	 rather than the coding region of the gene	 creating additional binding sites for transcription factors	 represents also a novel mechanism of genetic activation in cancer. The frequency of TERT mutations we detected in skin melanomas is similar to that reported by Horn et al.1 in primary melanomas (33%)	 but lower than the frequency found by the same authors in metastatic melanomas (85%) and by Huang et al.2 in a series of 70 melanomas and short-term cultures1	2. In our series	 we have analysed few metastatic melanomas that did not show a significantly higher percentage of TERT mutations. As our series is too small to allow a conclusion	 it remains to be verified if there is an increased frequency of TERT mutations in metastatic melanomas	 as suggested by previous reports1	2. We have confirmed	 in skin melanomas	 the significant association between TERT and BRAF mutations	 as previously advanced by Horn et al.1	 which we now also demonstrate in thyroid cancers. Interestingly	 in benign nevi	 which frequently harbour BRAF mutations	 we did not detect TERT mutations. This finding	 together with the high frequency of TERT mutations in metastatic melanomas1	 suggests that	 although BRAF mutations are thought to be an early event in melanoma genesis	 TERT mutations may occur at a later stage. No TERT promoter mutations were found in ocular melanomas	 which	 at variance with skin melanomas	 harbour GNAQ mutations instead of BRAF mutations4	5. Our results further support the assumption that ocular melanomas result from different etiopathogenic mechanism than skin melanomas5	6. Our data on CNS tumours indicate that TERT promoter mutations are frequent events in gliomas	 particularly in GBM where the highest mutation frequency was found. It has been shown that TERT mutations conferred enhanced TERT promoter activity in vitro1	2; our findings fit with this assumption because we observed that GBM with TERT promoter mutations appear to display increased telomerase expression	 despite the limited sensitivity of IHC and the low number of cases analysed. Our results are also in concordance with those of Lotsch et al.7 who reported that 60% of GBMs were positive for TERT mRNA and telomerase activity7. It will be interesting to assess whether the GBM positive for telomerase activity described by Lotsch et al.7 also harbour TERT promoter mutations. Our findings also indicate that TERT mutations are associated with older patients	 in accordance with a recent report3. The high frequency of TERT mutations in CNS tumours	 particularly in intermediate and high-grade tumours	 opens a window for new approaches in the therapy of CNS tumours. In thyroid cancer	 TERT mutations were only found in follicular cell-derived cancers (PTC	 follicular thyroid carcinoma	 poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma). No mutations were detected in medullary thyroid carcinomas	 as described by Killela et al.3	 nor in normal thyroid and benign lesions	 such as goitre	 adenomas or thyroiditis; this finding fits with previous studies that reported telomerase expression in malignant lesions and not in normal tissue or hyperplastic lesions8	9.

In cPTC	 TERT mutations were associated with BRAF mutation	 highlighting the coexistence of activation of BRAF and TERT	 previously reported in melanoma1 (Supplementary Fig. S2). Our results reinforce the hypothesis of a link between BRAF activation and telomerase expression	 which can be mediated by transcription factors binding to the newly created consensus binding sites	 as previously advanced by Horn et al.1. Both in thyroid carcinoma and melanoma	 it seems that a â€˜backgroundâ€™ status of activated BRAF enhances the effects of TERT promoter mutation. Our results in TERT mRNA expression strengthen this assumption	 showing	 for the first time	 an increased TERT expression in tumours harbouring BRAF and TERT mutation (Fig. 3). Further observational and mechanistic studies are needed to clarify these points. TERT alterations seem to constitute an early and frequent event in bladder cancer. These findings fit with the high prevalence of telomerase activity previously described in bladder tumours10. The recurrent hotspot mutations in TERT were advanced to be	 in melanomas	 induced by ultraviolet radiation2. Bladder is a target for several chemical carcinogens; it remains to be found whether TERT mutations can also result from the action of such agents. The identification of TERT mutations in urine may provide a biomarker for early diagnosis and monitoring of bladder cancer. No TERT mutations were detected in kidney cancers	 nor in 17 phaeochromocytoma and 36 GISTs. The underlying reasons for the tissue specificity of TERT mutations remain to be clarified. We can hypothesize that TERT mutations can be present in two settings. As described by Killela et al.3	 TERT mutations can be relevant in tissues with relative low rates of self-renewal	 which fits with our findings in follicular cell-derived thyroid cancer and gliomas where they are associated with the older age of the patients. On the other hand	 these mutations can also result from environmental factors such as ultraviolet radiation and chemical carcinogens as suggested by their high frequency in melanoma	 bladder and tongue1â€“3. In summary	 our data identify TERT mutations as common events in human cancers and support the assumption that TERT promoter mutations may be one of the mechanisms that underlies telomerase reactivation in several types of human tumours.  Introduction The telomere sequences at the chromosomal ends	 composed of tandem repeats of TTAGGG	 are protected by a number of molecules that constitute the capping Shelterin complex [1 ;  2]. The incomplete replication due to limitations of the process	 called â€˜end-replication problemâ€™	 results in shortening of telomeres in each successive mitotic cell division that eventually leads to replicative senescence referred to as the â€˜Hayflick limitâ€™ [3; 4 ;  5]. Maintenance of telomere repeat length is dependent on sustained expression of telomerase holoenzyme that adds de novo repeat units at the end of each replication cycle [ 6 ;  7]. Progressive attrition of telomeres is also defined as one of the hallmarks of aging of organisms [ 8 ;  9]. Cancer cells	 characteristically	 acquire infinite capability to divide through maintenance of telomeres by sustained expression of telomerase or in its absence by an alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanism [ 10; 11; 12; 13; 14 ;  15â€¢â€¢].  Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase that together with a RNA component	 TERC	 maintains genomic integrity by telomere elongation [ 16]. Though TERT and TERC are sufficient for in vitro telomerase activity	 the in vivo telomerase functioning requires additional components that associate with TERT and TERC	 to form the holoenzyme [ 17 ;  18]. Those include dyskerin (DKC)	 NOP10 ribonucleoprotein (NOP10)	 GAR1 ribonucleoprotein homolog (yeast) (GAR1)	 NHP2 ribonucleoprotein (NHP2)	 reptin and pontin [ 11; 19; 20; 21 ;  22].  Deregulation of telomerase has been shown to be a ubiquitous feature in human cancers with over 90% of cancers showing an upregulation of the enzyme [11; 23 ;  24]. The telomerase activity is dependent on a number of factors	 regulated at various stages	 which include gene transcription	 mRNA splicing	 maturation and modifications of TERT and TERC	 transport and localization of those components and assembly of active telomerase ribonucleoprotein to telomeres [ 4; 5; 16; 20; 21; 25; 26 ;  27]. The catalytic component TERT acts as a determinant of telomerase activity and its transcription is repressed in most of the somatic cells with the exception of proliferative cells of self-renewing tissues [ 28; 29 ;  30]. An increased expression of TERT has been consistently demonstrated to be a fundamental requirement for cellular transformation [ 4; 31; 32; 33; 34â€¢ ;  35].  The mechanism of TERT upregulation in cancers had been attributed to several mechanisms including epigenetic deregulation as well as genetic amplification of the locus containing TERT gene [ 36 ;  37]. In the absence of any evidence of a definite mechanism	 the telomerase activity in tumor cells has been attributed to the assumption of stem cells being the progenitors in all cancers [38]. The normal stem cells in self-renewing tissues retain telomerase throughout lifetime replication thus abrogating a requirement for a positive selection [6]. The recently discovered TERT promoter mutations add a new dimension to the acquisition of telomerase activity in human cancers. In this review we provide an overview and possible implications of the newly discovered mutations in the promoter of the TERT gene in a wide range of cancers.  Structure and regulation of the TERT promoter The human TERT gene is located on chromosome 5p15.33 and the promoter region of the gene is considered to be the most important regulatory element for telomerase expression. The TERT promoter contains binding motifs for several factors that regulate the gene transcription and distinctly lacks a TATA box or a similar sequence [ 39; 40; 41; 42 ;  43]. The core promoter region consists of 260 base pairs with several transcription-factor binding sites that include E-boxes where c-Myc has been confirmed to bind and activate the transcription [ 44; 45; 46; 47 ;  48]. BRCA1 in conjunction with N-Myc interacting protein (Nmi) forms a complex with c-Myc and inhibits TERT promoter activity	 that property is lost in some mutant forms of BRCA1 [ 49]. Other sequence elements in TERT promoter include GC-boxes	 which are binding sites for zinc finger transcription factor	 Sp1 [ 4 ;  45]. Transcription of the TERT gene is also regulated by various hormones	 cytokines and oncogenes [ 45]. Several repressors of the TERT transcription are also known. p53 has been shown to downregulate TERT transcription in a Sp1-dependent manner [ 50]. Ets transcription factors that comprise over 30 members are prominently associated with telomerase activation [ 42 ;  51]. Ets2 has been shown to form a complex with c-Myc in a breast cancer cell line [ 44 ;  51]. Ets transcription factors are also shown to be stimulated by oncogenes EGF	 Her2/Nez	 Ras and Raf [ 52 ;  53]. The activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressors are known to account for cellular immortalization through induction of TERT transcription [ 54]. The high GC content around the transcription start site of the TERT promoter confers epigenetic regulation through methylation and chromatin remodeling [ 37 ;  55].  TERT promoter mutations in human cancers A discovery of a high-penetrant disease-segregating causal germline mutation in a melanoma family and highly specific and recurrent somatic mutations in tumors from unrelated patients in the TERT promoter has likely provided a definite mechanism for cancer-specific TERT activation [ 56â€¢â€¢ ;  57â€¢â€¢]. Two independent studies using diverse approaches discovered non-coding mutations	 mainly at two residues	 within the core promoter region of the TERT gene. One study was based on the identification of a causal gene mutation in a large melanoma pedigree where affected individuals presented a severe form of the disease with an early age of onset. The linkage analysis identified a 2.2 megabase telomeric region on chromosome 5p that included TERT along with more than 80 other genes [ 56â€¢â€¢]. Sequencing of the entire stretch of DNA region in the family resulted in identification of a disease segregating A > C (T > G) single base change at âˆ’57 bp (Chr 5: 1	295	161 hg19 coordinate) from ATG start site. The germline mutation was present in affected and absent in unaffected individuals in the family with the exception of one. Subsequent screening of cell lines derived from melanoma metastases from unrelated patients led to the detection of recurrent and mutually exclusive somatic mutations at two residues âˆ’124 and âˆ’146 from the ATG start site in the TERT promoter [ 56â€¢â€¢]. Serendipitously	 an independent study using a whole genome sequencing approach also reported the recurrent somatic TERT promoter mutations at the same positions [ 57â€¢â€¢]. Other mutations detected in TERT promoter included the CC > TT tandem mutations at âˆ’124/âˆ’125 and âˆ’138/âˆ’139 bp from ATG start site. The germline and somatic mutations in the non-coding part of the TERT gene were defined by common salient features. One of the underlying features included a de novo creation of CCGGAA/T general binding motifs for E-twenty six/ternary complex factors (Ets/TCF) transcription factors	 which differed from pre-existing GGAA/T Ets binding sites within the TERT promoter ( Figure 1). The somatic mutations at both positions being C > T and the additional detection of CC > TT tandem mutations in a proportion of tumors augmented the evidence for the UV-origin of tumor specific nucleotide changes in melanoma as shown previously in studies based on whole genome sequencing [58â€¢]. Interestingly	 the mutations detected in the TERT promoter in melanoma were more frequent than those in the BRAF gene.  Schematic representation of a part of the TERT promoter that contains residues	 ... Figure 1.  Schematic representation of a part of the TERT promoter that contains residues	 which are affected by a germline mutation in a melanoma family at the position âˆ’57 bp and recurrent somatic mutations at the positions âˆ’124 and âˆ’146 bp from the ATG start site. The mutations create CCGGAA/T binding motif for Ets/TCF transcription factors that results in an increased TERT expression. Pre-existing binding sites for other transcriptions factors are shown above the sequence. Figure options It was also observed that the TERT promoter mutations tend to occur more often than expected by chance in tumors with either BRAF mutations (odds ratio [OR] 3.2	 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3â€“8.2) or with concomitant alterations in both BRAF and CDKN2A (OR 5.6	 95% CI 2.4â€“13.8) [ 56â€¢â€¢]. BRAF mutations	 due to occurrence and role in development of melanocytic nevi	 are considered as the driver genetic lesions in melanoma [ 56â€¢â€¢; 59â€¢ ;  60]. The loss of CDKN2A has been suggested to play a role in the escape of melanocytes from BRAF induced senescence [61]. The acquisition of TERT promoter mutations can be hypothesized to facilitate stabilization of the transformed genome through reversal of telomeric loss. Most melanocytic nevi carry BRAF mutations	 whereas TERT promoter mutations and CDKN2A alterations are detected only in primary melanoma and beyond [ 56â€¢â€¢ ;  62].  Bonafide of newly discovered non-coding mutations in the TERT promoter was established by the detection in cancers other than melanoma [ 63â€¢â€¢]. The frequency of the mutations seems to vary between cancer types (Table 1). The highest frequencies of the TERT promoter mutations have so far been reported	 besides melanoma	 in pleomorphic dermal sarcoma	 myxoid liposarcoma	 glioma	 urothelial cell carcinoma of bladder	 basal and squamous cell carcinoma of skin	 liver cancer and others [ 63â€¢â€¢; 64; 65; 66; 67; 68; 69; 70; 71; 72; 73; 74; 75 ;  76]. The mutations occur in other cancer types as well	 albeit	 at low frequencies [ 63â€¢â€¢ ;  67]. Based on the prevalence in different cancer types it has been hypothesized that the TERT promoter mutations mainly occur in tumors that are derived from tissues with low rates of self-renewal [ 63â€¢â€¢ ;  77]. Unlike melanoma and other skin related malignancies	" no tumor from the cancers affecting internal organs carried CC > TT tandem mutations in the TERT promoter with the exception of that at the positions âˆ’138/âˆ’139 bp from ATG start site in bladder cancer. The tandem mutation reported so far in 4 of the 1231 bladder tumors could also be generated by a single-base mutation at âˆ’138 bp as the base change at âˆ’139 bp has been reported as a rare polymorphism represented by rs35550267 [ 56â€¢â€¢; 65 ;  66]. The differences in mutational pattern in cancer types are known to reflect etiological divergences and the C > T base change in tumors can also be attributed to APOBEC cytidine deaminase expression in cancer development [ 78â€¢â€¢ ;  79â€¢â€¢].

Table options Functional aspects of TERT promoter mutations The high recurrence	 specificity and gain of function support that the non-coding TERT promoter mutations are driver rather than passenger events in cancer development. The functional relevance of the mutations was indicated by the basic reporter assays that showed 2â€“4-fold increased promoter activity [ 56â€¢â€¢; 57â€¢â€¢ ;  80â€¢â€¢]. Tumors from thyroid cancers	 primary glioma	 malignant pleural mesothelioma and liver cancers with TERT promoter mutations were associated with higher gene expression than those without mutations [ 67; 69; 72 ;  74]. Though limited at the moment	 the available data do indicate a tendency of the TERT promoter mutations being present in specific clinical and phenotypic subtypes and appear to be associated with adversarial forms of the disease. While in medulloblastomas the TERT promoter mutations were inversely associated with increased OTX2 expression; in primary adult glioma	 the mutations occurred mainly in conjunction with EGFR amplification [ 69]. Glioma patients with TERT promoter mutations showed an association with poorer survival than patients without mutations; in thyroid cancer	 mutations are reportedly more frequent in advanced thyroid cancers than in papillary thyroid cancers [ 63â€¢â€¢; 70 ;  71].  The studies on bladder cancer consistently showed that TERT promoter mutations are the most frequent lesions with even distribution across all stages and grades [ 65; 66 ;  80â€¢â€¢]. Intriguingly	 an observed interaction has raised a possibility of eventual use of the TERT promoter mutations in conjunction with a common polymorphism within the sequence as biomarkers in bladder cancer. The data from bladder cancer showed that the variant allele of a common polymorphism at âˆ’245 bp from ATG start site in the TERT promoter acts as a modifier of the effect of TERT promoter mutations on patient survival and disease recurrence [ 80â€¢â€¢]. Bladder cancer patients with TERT promoter mutations in tumors showed almost two-fold decreased survival and increased disease recurrence in the absence but not in the presence of the variant allele for the rs2853669 polymorphism [ 80â€¢â€¢]. Mechanistic support for the observation was provided by the fact that mutations result in de novo creation of Ets/TCF binding motifs; the variant allele of the rs2853669 polymorphism	 on the contrary	 disrupts a preexisting non-canonical Ets2 binding site in the proximal region of the TERT promoter	 adjacent to an E-box [ 44].  The occurrence of highly specific TERT promoter mutations indicates a strong selection pressure for the gene over-expression on path to cellular transformation. Increased telomerase production has been demonstrated to promote cancer progression in an animal model [ 81â€¢]. The effect of the promoter mutations on TERT expression can be tenable only in the presence of Ets/TCF transcription factors that can specifically bind to the de novo sites created by the mutations. Some of the Ets/TCF transcription factors are downstream targets of MAPK pathway	 where BRAF is a prominent intermediate [ 82; 83 ;  84]. Whether in melanoma activated BRAF is a driving force in selection of TERT promoter mutations remains to be determined. Nevertheless	 expression of Ets transcription factors is ubiquitous in melanoma and other cancers [ 85 ;  86].  Many studies have stressed the function of the TERT gene beyond its role in maintenance of the telomere; therefore the mutations in the TERT promoter can affect non-canonical processes associated with TERT [ 87; 88; 89; 90 ;  91]. TERT acts as a modulator of Wnt-b-catenin signaling pathway and induces stem cell characteristics in glioma; TERT also regulates expression of NF-kB	 a master regulator of inflammation [ 92â€¢; 93 ;  94]. TERT was shown to be important for proliferation of p53-negative cells through ATR mediated stabilization of ETV1	 which binds downstream of the transcriptional start site [95]. Other non-canonical functions of TERT include enhanced cell proliferation	 decreased apoptosis	 regulation of DNA damage responses	 chromatin state and increased cellular proliferation life span [ 96; 97 ;  98]. The effect of the mutations beyond transcription also remains a probability. The human TERT promoter contains G-rich sequence and has potential for G-quadruplex formation that can potentially be targeted to regulate gene transcription [ 99]. G-quadruplexes have been also implicated in inhibition of telomerase and control of gene expression [100].  Conceptual advancement and therapeutic possibilities The TERT promoter mutations are thought to represent a conceptual advancement in the sense that those instead of altering an encoded protein modulate transcriptional regulation and represent first evidence of driver alterations in so called â€˜dark matterâ€™ of the human genome [ 101â€¢ ;  102]. A host of germline variants discovered through genome wide association studies contribute to the susceptibility of various diseases through transcriptional deregulation [103]. While TERT promoter mutations represent novel findings in human cancer	 alterations in components associated with telomerase assembly	 telomere protection or telomere recruitment are known to impact stem cell function and lifespan in mammals through various disorders [ 104 ;  105].  Several strategies of therapeutic telomerase inhibition including small molecular inhibitors	 immunotherapy	 gene therapy	 telomere and telomerase-proteins in different cancers have entered clinical trial [106]. It will be interesting to see if the TERT promoter mutations	 that increase gene expression	 influence the current on-going research on targeted therapeutics or if the use of telomerase inhibitors in conjunction with kinase inhibitors like vemurafenib or similar small molecules in melanoma can alleviate recurrent resistance [ 107]. Malignant cells	 like all actively growing cells	 must maintain their telomeres	 but genetic mechanisms responsible for telomere maintenance in tumors have only recently been discovered. In particular	 mutations of the telomere binding proteins alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) or death-domain associated protein (DAXX) have been shown to underlie a telomere maintenance mechanism not involving telomerase (alternative lengthening of telomeres)	 and point mutations in the promoter of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene increase telomerase expression and have been shown to occur in melanomas and a small number of other tumors. To further define the tumor types in which this latter mechanism plays a role	 we surveyed 1	230 tumors of 60 different types. We found that tumors could be divided into types with low (<15%) and high (â‰¥15%) frequencies of TERT promoter mutations. The nine TERT-high tumor types almost always originated in tissues with relatively low rates of self renewal	 including melanomas	 liposarcomas	 hepatocellular carcinomas	 urothelial carcinomas	 squamous cell carcinomas of the tongue	 medulloblastomas	 and subtypes of gliomas (including 83% of primary glioblastoma	 the most common brain tumor type). TERT and ATRX mutations were mutually exclusive	 suggesting that these two genetic mechanisms confer equivalent selective growth advantages. In addition to their implications for understanding the relationship between telomeres and tumorigenesis	 TERT mutations provide a biomarker that may be useful for the early detection of urinary tract and liver tumors and aid in the classification and prognostication of brain tumors.  Telomeres are nucleoprotein complexes at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes that are required for chromosomal integrity. Several hundred nucleotides of telomere repeats cap each chromosomal end	 and in the absence of telomerase activity	 telomeres shorten with each cell division (1). Eventually	 uncapped telomeres trigger cell death or senescence. Cancer cells seem to divide ad infinitum and therefore	 require some telomere maintenance mechanism to avoid this fate. Because telomerase activity is generally higher in cancer cells than normal cells	 it was originally believed that telomerase was somehow activated in cancer cells (2â€“6). However	 it was subsequently realized that telomerase was only inactive in terminally differentiated cells and that normal stem cells in self-renewing tissues retained telomerase activity (1	 7â€“9). Because normal stem cells must replicate throughout the long lifetimes of mammals (which can be more than a century in humans)	 it is clear that such cells must also retain telomerase activity. Because normal stem cells are thought to be the progenitors of cancers	 there would be no need to specifically activate telomerase in cancer cells; the enzyme was already active in the precursors	 just as were the hundreds of other enzymes and proteins normally required for cell proliferation.  This view was challenged by the discovery of another mechanism for maintaining telomere length [i.e.	 alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT)] (10â€“12). ALT occurs in the absence of telomerase activity and seems to be dependent on homologous recombination. It occurs in a particularly high fraction of certain tumor types	 such as sarcomas	 pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors	 and brain tumors	 but rarely in most common tumor types	 such as those tumor types of the colon	 breast	 lung	 prostate	 or pancreas (13). Why would cancer cells need ALT if telomerase activity was already constitutively active in their precursors? This question was highlighted by the discovery that many ALT cancers harbor mutations in alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) or death-domain associated protein (DAXX)	 genes encoding proteins that interact with each other at telomeres (10	 11). Presumably	 the absence of functional ATRX/DAXX complexes permits the homologous recombination resulting in ALT. At minimum	 these data were compatible with the ideas that there could be a selective advantage for genetic alterations that results in telomere maintenance and that telomerase is not indefinitely activated in all normal stem cell precursors of cancers.  Another challenge to the idea that genetic alterations were not required for telomerase activation in cancer was raised by the finding that mutations of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter occurred in âˆ¼70% of melanomas and in a small number of tumor cell lines derived from various tissue types (14	 15). Importantly	 only 5 of 110 cell lines derived from lung	 stomach	 ovary	 uterus	 or prostate cancers harbored TERT promoter mutations	 whereas 19 mutations were found among 37 cell lines derived from various other tumor types. This situation is analogous to the situation for ALT	 which is infrequently observed in common epithelial cancers but is observed more regularly in tumors derived from nonepithelial cells	 particularly sarcomas and brain tumors (13).  These findings prompted us to formulate a hypothesis about the mechanisms responsible for telomerase activity in cancers. We suggest that there are two ways to maintain telomere lengths as cells divide: (i) through epigenetic regulation of telomerase activity	 which occurs in stem cells of tissues that are rapidly renewing	 and (ii) through somatic mutations that maintain telomere lengths	 such as mutations in the TERT promoter or mutations in DAXX or ATRX. Those cancers that originate in tissues that are constantly self-renewing	 such as cancers of the epithelia of the gastrointestinal tract and skin or bone marrow	 would be unlikely to harbor telomere-maintaining mutations	 because telomerase is already epigenetically activated in their precursor cells. In contrast	 tumors arising from cells that are not constantly self-renewing	 such as neurons	 glial cells	 fibroblasts	 hepatocytes	 islet cells	 and pancreatic ductal epithelial cells	 might frequently harbor such mutations. A corollary of this hypothesis is that tumor types exhibiting high frequencies of ALT would also exhibit high frequencies of TERT mutations	 and these mutations would be distributed in a mutually exclusive fashion. To test these hypotheses as well as answer other questions related to the role of TERT promoter mutations in various cancer types	 we determined the prevalence of TERT promoter mutations in a large number of tumors.  Go to: RESULTS We attempted to evaluate at least 20 individual specimens of common tumor types and fewer specimens of rare tumor types	 depending on availability of specimens in our laboratories. In those tumor types in which our pilot studies showed a significant number of mutations	 additional tumors were evaluated. Melanomas and tumors of the lung	 stomach	 and esophagus were excluded	 because they had already been adequately evaluated in the seminal papers cited (14	 15). When primary tumors rather than cell lines were used	 we ensured that the fraction of neoplastic cells was >50% through histopathologic examination of frozen sections of the tissue blocks used for DNA purification. In those cases in which the neoplastic content was <50%	 we microdissected the lesions to enrich the neoplastic content to >50%. Primers were designed to amplify the region containing the two TERT mutations that were previously describedâ€”C228T and C250Tâ€”corresponding to the positions 124 and 146 bp	 respectively	 upstream of the TERT ATG start site (14	 15). The PCR fragments were then purified and analyzed by conventional Sanger sequencing.  In all	 we evaluated TERT promoter mutations in 1	230 tumor specimens and identified 231 mutations (18.8%) (Table 1). C228T and C250T mutations accounted for 77.5% and 20.8% of the alterations	 respectively (Dataset S1). Additionally	 we detected four mutations that had not been observed previously: three C228A mutations and one C229A mutation (Dataset S1). All four of these mutations as well as a representative subset of the C228T and C250T mutations (n = 59) were somatic	 as evidenced by their absence in normal tissues of the patients containing the mutations in their tumors.  Table 1. Table 1. Frequency of TERT promoter mutations The 1	230 tumors represented 60 tumor types. In 26 of these tumor types	 at least 15 individual tumors were evaluated (comprising a total of 1	043 individual tumors) (Fig. 1). In the remaining tumor types	 only a small number of samples (2â€“12) was available	 in part because these tumor types are generally uncommon in Western populations (Table 1). Among the tumor types in which at least 15 individual tumors were available for study	 a clear distinction could be made. Eighteen of these tumor types had only occasional TERT promoter mutations (zero to three mutations	 comprising 0â€“15% of the tumors of each type) (Fig. 1). We classified these tumor types as TERT-low (TERT-L)	 because they had a low frequency of TERT promoter mutations. Eight other tumor types were classified as TERT-high (TERT-H) because of their relatively high prevalence of TERT promoter mutations (16â€“83% of the tumors of each type).  Fig. 1. Fig. 1. Frequency of TERT promoter mutations; 15 or more tumors were analyzed in 26 tumor types. Gliomas are divided into primary GBM	 astrocytoma (including astrocytoma grades II and III	 as well as secondary GBM)	 and oligodendroglioma. The TERT-L tumor types included some of the most prevalent cancers	 including epithelial tumors of the breast	 prostate	 thyroid	 pancreas	 gall bladder	 uterus	 and colon (as well as tumors of the lung	 stomach	 and esophagus based on prior studies) (14	 15) and leukemias. In fact	 no TERT mutations were identified in any specimen of 30 tumor types that we studied	 comprising a total of 546 tumors (Table 1). Some nonepithelial cancers	 such as synovial sarcomas	 chordomas	 neuroblastomas	 osteosarcomas	 and ependymomas	 were also TERT-L.  Eight TERT-H tumor types were identified (in addition to the previously described melanomas) (14	 15). These tumors included tumors of the CNS	 transitional cell carcinomas of the urinary tract	 hepatocellular carcinomas	 myxoid liposarcomas	 and oral cavity carcinomas. Although only a small number of TERT-H tumors (other than melanomas) were examined in previous studies (15)	 mutations in gliomas	 hepatocellular	 and oral cavity carcinomas were detected	 which would be expected on the basis of the high frequency of mutation in these tumors types (Table 1).  Clinical and Molecular Correlations in TERT-H Tumors. Sarcomas. One of the highest frequencies of TERT promoter mutation was found in myxoid liposarcoma (19 of 24 tumors	 79% with mutation). Myxoid liposarcomas account for more than one-third of all liposarcomas and âˆ¼10% of all adult soft tissue sarcomas (16). Patients are relatively young	 with a peak age range between 30 and 50 y. At the genetic level	 the most characteristic change is a t(12;16) (q13;p11) chromosomal translocation that results in the fusion of the FUS and DDIT3 genes (16	 17). The cellular origin of these tumors is unknown	 but preadipocytic progenitor cells and mesenchymal stem cells have been implicated (18); after embryogenesis	 the mitotic activity of these cells is thought to be low. Other sarcomas	 also thought to originate from mesenchymal cells that do not self-renew in the absence of damage	 were not TERT-H (Table 1). These sarcomas included synovial sarcomas (0% of 16 tumors) and osteosarcomas (4.3% of 23 tumors). Of note	 myxoid liposarcomas have been previously shown to have a relatively high prevalence of ALT (24% of 38 tumors) (13	 19). The data	 in aggregate	 are compatible with the idea that myxoid liposarcomas almost always genetically activate telomere maintenance genes through either TERT promoter mutations or ALT.  Hepatocellular carcinomas. Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) are the third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide	 and their incidence is increasing in the United States (20). Most HCCs in the United States are associated with Hepatitis B or C Virus infection	 whereas others are associated with alcoholic cirrhosis; 44% of HCC samples that we evaluated harbored TERT promoter mutations (27/61). This finding makes TERT the most commonly mutated gene yet observed in this tumor type (21	 22). The mutations seemed to occur relatively early in tumorigenesis	 because they were observed in 39% of stage I well-differentiated HCCs (Table S1). TERT mutations were observed in virally associated tumors as well as cases without any underlying liver disease at similar frequencies (Table S1). There was also no difference in the prevalence of TERT promoter mutations with respect to sex	 age	 or ethnicity (Table S1). ALT has been observed in 7% of 121 HCCs studied previously (13).  Urinary tract cancers. Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder is the fourth most common type of cancer in American males. In 2013	 over 73	000 patients will be diagnosed with bladder cancer leading to approximately 15	000 deaths in the US alone (23). Two-thirds of the 21 urothelial carcinomas of the bladder that we studied harbored TERT promoter mutations. We were also able to evaluate 19 urothelial carcinomas of the upper urinary tract	 a much less common anatomic site for this histopathologic subtype of tumor. Nine of nineteen upper urinary tract urothelial carcinomas harbored TERT mutations. TERT mutations are	 therefore	 the most frequently mutated genes yet identified in urothelial carcinoma of either the bladder or upper urinary tract (24). The prevalence of ALT in bladder cancers is very low (1% of 188 cancers) (13).  Head and neck cancers. Head and neck cancers are almost always squamous cell carcinomas and can occur throughout the oral cavity lining (mucous membranes of the cheek	 hard and soft palate	 tongue	 supraglottis	 etc.). It is the sixth most common cancer in the world	 and 50	000 cases occurred in the United States in 2012. We identified TERT promoter mutations in 17% of 70 oral cavity cancers that we evaluated. However	 the anatomic distribution of the cases with TERT promoter mutations was striking: 11 of 12 cancers with TERT promoter mutations were in the oral tongue	 although only 23 of 70 total cases originated in the oral tongue (P < 0.0001	 Fisher exact probability test	 two-tailed) (Table S2). The basis for this extraordinary selectivity is curious given the shared characteristics of the squamous epithelium lining the tongue and other parts of the head and neck	 including the oral cavity. Moreover	 we evaluated 22 squamous cell carcinomas of another site (the cervix) and found only one TERT mutation (4.5%) (Table 1). Most cervical squamous cell carcinomas and a subset of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas are caused by human papillomavirus	 which can activate telomerase by expressing E6 and E7 viral oncogenes (25). These findings raise the possibility that human papillomavirus infection and TERT mutation may be alternative mechanisms to activate telomerase among squamous cell carcinomas. We were unable to test correlations between TERT promoter mutations and HPV status or other clinical parameters because of the small number of patients with available data (Table S2). There have been no ALT cases identified among 70 head and neck cancers	 including 41 oral cavity cancers (13).  Medulloblastomas. Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor of childhood (26). TERT mutations occurred in 21% of 91 medulloblastomas that we evaluated. As with the oral cavity cancers	 TERT mutations were not distributed randomly among the medulloblastoma patients. Although medulloblastomas are usually diagnosed at a young age	 those medulloblastomas with TERT mutations were diagnosed at a considerably older age (median = 6 vs. 16 y	 P = 0.0012	 t test assuming unequal variances	 two-tailed) (Fig. S1A). This observation has important implications for understanding the basis for the selectivity of the tumor types harboring TERT promoter mutations (Discussion); 45 of 90 patients had been assessed previously for orthodenticle homeobox 2 (OTX2) gene amplification and expression	 and alterations in this transcription factor are known to correlate with clinically distinct molecular subtypes of medulloblastoma (27). OTX2 expression was >100-fold higher in medulloblastoma patients without TERT promoter mutations than in those patients with TERT promoter mutations (note the log scale in Fig. S1B). The high levels of OTX2 expression were usually the result of OTX2 gene amplification (Fig. S1C). The association of TERT promoter mutations with an older age at diagnosis and a lack of OTX2 overexpression raises the possibility that TERT mutations occur in a specific clinical and molecular subtype of medulloblastoma. The most likely molecular subtype of medulloblastoma that may be enriched for TERT mutations is the noninfant sonic hedgehog subtype	 which is characterized by an older age at diagnosis and lower expression of OTX2 (28	 29). Larger studies will be needed to make this association more definitive. ALT has been observed in 7% of 55 medulloblastomas studied previously (13).  Gliomas. Gliomas are the most common CNS tumor type and accounted for >14	000 deaths in the United States last year (30). Histopathological and clinical criteria established by the World Health Organization are used to characterize these tumors into several subtypes (30). We considered the four main subtypes individually (Table S3).  Primary glioblastoma. These primary glioblastomas (GBMs) are the most common malignant brain tumors in adults	 accounting for âˆ¼17% of all intracranial tumors	 and they confer the worst survival (median of âˆ¼15 mo) (31). These high-grade (grade IV) tumors have no detectable precursor lesions and have been referred to as de novo tumors. The prevalence of TERT promoter mutations was remarkably high in GBMs of adults (83% of 78 tumors) (Table S3). This prevalence is higher than the prevalence of any other genetic mutation in this tumor type (32). These findings provide a molecular mechanism responsible for the high levels of TERT mRNA and telomerase activity observed in GBMs (33).  For 51 of 78 primary GBM tumors	 data on other common genetic alterations as well as clinical data were available (Fig. 2A). Interestingly	 EGFR amplification	 a classic molecular feature of primary GBM	 exclusively occurred in tumors with TERT mutations (P = 0.0006	 Fisher exact probability test	 two-tailed). Conversely	 no association was identified between TERT mutation and either TP53 mutation or CDKN2A deletion. Importantly	 the frequency of TERT promoter mutations was considerably less in primary GBMs of pediatric patients (11% of 19 tumors) than adult patients (Discussion) (Table S3). ALT was observed in 11% of 105 adult GBM and 44% of pediatric GBM (i.e.	 the reverse of the pattern observed for TERT promoter mutations) (13). Primary GBM patients without TERT mutations survived considerably longer	 on average	 than patients with such mutations (median = 27 vs. 14 mo	 P = 0.01 by the log rank test) (Fig. S3).  Fig. 2. Fig. 2. Mutations of selected genes in glioma subtypes. (A) Distribution of TERT mutations and other genetic events in 51 primary GBMs. (B) Distribution of TERT mutations and other genetic events among 40 astrocytomas	 including grades IIâ€“III astrocytomas ... Astrocytomas. Infiltrative astrocytic tumors frequently progress	 with recurrent lesions often of higher grade than the original lesions excised at surgery. They are most often grade II or III but can progress to grade IV (at which point they are often termed secondary GBMs). Astrocytomas of any stage rarely contained TERT promoter mutations (10% of 40 total samples) (Table S3). Instead	 they more frequently contained isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) or isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) mutations (75% of 40 tumors)	 ATRX mutations (70% of 40 tumors)	 and TP53 mutations (73% of 40 tumors) (Fig. 2B). ALT has been observed in 63% of 57 astrocytomas	 consistent with the high prevalence of ATRX mutations (13). The lack of activating TERT mutations in IDH1 mutant tumors is also corroborated by the lack of TERT mRNA and telomerase activity observed in these lesions (33).  Oligodendrogliomas. Like astrocytomas	 oligodendrogliomas often progress	 and they frequently contain TERT promoter mutations (78% of 45 tumor samples) (Table S3). Oligodendroglioma was the only tumor type studied (of all types	 including non-CNS tumors) (Dataset S1) in which C250T mutations were nearly as frequent as C228T mutations. In oligodendrogliomas	 43% of tumors with TERT mutations contained C250T substitutions	 whereas in other gliomas	 only 10% did (P < 0.001	 Fisher exact probability test	 two-tailed). Interestingly	 91% of 45 oligodendrogliomas that were evaluated for ATRX and TERT sequence alterations contained either an ATRX coding or a TERT promoter mutation	 suggesting that genetic alterations resulting in telomere maintenance are required for tumorigenesis of this subtype.  Oligodendrogliomas have long been known to contain characteristic losses of chromosome arms 1p and 19q	 and these losses reflect inactivation of the CIC gene on chromosome 19q and in some cases	 inactivation of the FUBP1 gene on chromosome 1p (34â€“36). Accordingly	 78% of 45 oligodendrogliomas contained chromosome arm 1p or 19q losses of heterozygosity (Fig. 2C) (34â€“36). Moreover	 nearly all of them contained IDH1 or IDH2 mutations (93%).  Oligoastrocytomas. As their name implies	 these tumors are mixed	 with histologic features of both oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas. This mixture	 in part	 reflects the difficulties in distinguishing the various glioma subtypes from one another on the basis of histopathologic or clinical criteria (37). The genetic features of this tumor subtype reflect this mixture: the prevalence of TERT promoter mutations (25% of 24 tumors) was intermediate between oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas	 as were the frequencies of chromosome (Chr) 1p/19q losses and IDH1/2	 TP53	 and ATRX mutations (Fig. 2D).  ALT Vs. TERT. ALT has been observed in tumors of the CNS (particularly gliomas) more frequently than tumors of any other tissue type. Given that TERT promoter mutations are also common in gliomas	 the relationship between these two features could be determined with high confidence. The tumors depicted in Fig. 2 had previously been evaluated for alterations in ATRX	 which is a nearly perfect surrogate for the ALT phenotype (11	 37). Our data show that there were 50 gliomas with ATRX mutations and 83 gliomas with TERT mutations; 0 of 83 tumors with TERT mutations contained ATRX mutations (P < 0.0001	 Fisher exact probability test	 two-tailed).  Go to: DISCUSSION The results described above	 as well as the results published in refs. 14 and 15	 provide evidence that supports one of the hypotheses raised in the Introduction and refutes others. The first of these hypotheses was that TERT mutations would only be observed in tumors derived from tissues that are not constantly self-renewing under normal circumstances. This hypothesis was supported in part: the vast majority of TERT promoter mutations occurred in tumors derived from tissues that do not continually self-renew. The TERT-H tumor types include only melanomas	 certain subtypes of glioma	 medulloblastomas	 squamous cell cancers of the tongue	 liposarcomas	 HCCs	 and urinary tract cancers. The normal transitional cells of the urinary tract have very low proliferative indices (0.64% Â± 0.52%)	 much lower than indices of gastrointestinal tract	 bone marrow	 or skin (38). Normal hepatocytes also do not turnover often (39)	 and glial cells are thought to have limited capacity for self-renewal (40).  Two other observations also support the hypothesis. Pediatric primary GBMs rarely contained TERT mutations (11%)	 whereas adult primary GBMs frequently did (83%). Pediatric GBMs are presumably derived from cells that are still dividing at the time of tumor initiation	 and therefore	 there is no selective advantage conferred by activating telomerase through a genetic mutation. Adult GBMs	 in contrast	 are presumably derived from postmitotic cells	 and they should require telomerase activation. Similarly	 medulloblastomas are embryonal tumors that typically arise from precursor cells with high self-renewal rates that do not usually persist in adults. This finding is consistent with our observation that the mean age of medulloblastoma patients with TERT mutations was considerably older than the mean age of medulloblastoma patients without TERT mutations (Fig. S1A).  There are	 however	 exceptions that belie the hypothesis that TERT mutations occur only in nonâ€“self-renewing tissues. The epithelium that lines the tongue constantly self-renews	 but many squamous carcinomas of the tongue harbored TERT mutations (Table S2). Additionally	 the squamous epithelia of the tongue certainly would not be expected to self-renew less than other squamous epithelia of the oral cavity	 but the latter rarely harbored TERT mutations (Table S2). This finding may suggest that squamous carcinomas of the tongue originate from a different cell of origin than other oral cavity squamous carcinomas. Conversely	 only a subset of the tumor types derived from nonâ€“self-renewing tissues was TERT-H. For example	 the TERT-H tumors included myxoid liposarcomas but not synovial sarcomas. Moreover	 cells of the pancreas (the islets of Langerhans and the ductal epithelial cells) rarely renew	 but pancreatic tumors of all types (pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors	 acinar carcinomas	 and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas) were all TERT-L. The most that we can conclude at present is that nonâ€“self-renewing cell types are the major sources of TERT-H tumors but that nonâ€“self-renewal is only one of the factors that determines whether tumor cells with TERT promoter mutations will have a selective growth advantage over adjoining cells.  The first corollary to the hypothesis raised in the Introduction was that tumor types that displayed ALT would be those types that harbored TERT promoter mutations. This corollary is soundly refuted by these data	 at least in general terms. Although tumor types of the CNS and liposarcomas had high frequencies of ALT as well as high frequencies of TERT promoter mutations	 these tumor types were the exceptions rather than the rule. For example	 pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors have very high frequencies of ALT but no evidence of TERT mutations. Conversely	 bladder cancers frequently have TERT mutations but never have ALT (13). Additionally	 even among gliomas	 pediatric GBMs have high frequencies of ALT and low frequencies of TERT mutations	 whereas adult GBMs have the reverse pattern.  The second corollary was that the selective advantage afforded by TERT mutation would be equivalent to the advantage afforded by ATRX mutation (conferring ALT). This hypothesis was most effectively tested in gliomas	 in which both ATRX coding and TERT promoter mutations were common. There was a striking mutual exclusivity with respect to ATRX and TERT mutations (P < 0.0001)	 lending strong support to this idea.  These results also raise many unanswered questions. In some tumor types	 such as gliomas	 we can imagine that all tumors have genetically activated telomere maintenance programs through mutations in either TERT or ATRX. However	 in other tumor types with frequent ATRX mutations	 such as pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors	 what is responsible for activating telomerase in the fraction of cases not exhibiting ALT if it is not a mutation in the TERT promoter? Similarly	 what is responsible for activating telomerase in those tumors derived from nonâ€“self-renewing cell types in which neither ALT nor TERT mutations is frequently observed	 such as synovial sarcomas or osteosarcomas? Also	 there are occasional individual tumors among the TERT-L types that have TERT promoter mutations (e.g.	 cervical cancers	 ovarian cancers	 and in ref. 15	 lung cancers). What distinguishes these occasional cancers from others of the same histopathologic subtype? Whole-genome sequencing studies	 rather than those studies limited to the exome	 might provide answers to these questions.  The results recorded here have practical as well as basic scientific implications. Two-thirds of bladder cancers had TERT promoter mutations	 making it the most commonly mutated gene yet identified in invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. Given the persistently high mortality rate despite multimodality treatment in this group of patients	 these mutations represent ideal urinary biomarkers to detect bladder cancers at an early stage and to follow patients for evidence of progression or recurrence once they have been diagnosed (41). Similarly	 the high prevalence of TERT promoter mutations in HCCs and glioma subtypes provides excellent candidate biomarkers for early detection (HCC) or monitoring (HCC in the plasma and gliomas in the cerebrospinal fluid) (42	 43).  Another practical implication involves diagnostics. We conjecture that tumors with TERT promoter or ATRX mutations are derived from different precursor cells and that either type of precursor cell is different from those types that are the precursors of tumors without such mutations. This distinction could aid classification of the tumors in clinically meaningful ways. For example	 Fig. 2 and Fig. S2 outline the major genetic alterations occurring in the three most common types of gliomas. On the basis of the data in Fig. 2 Aâ€“C	 we speculate that oligodendrogliomas that lack TERT mutations but contain ATRX mutations may behave more like astrocytomas than oligodendrogliomas and vice versa. Similarly	 the primary GBMs without TERT mutations (15% of the total) may behave more like advanced progressive astrocytomas	 which generally lack TERT mutations. This possibility is supported by the observation that those primary GBM patients without TERT mutations had a longer survival	 on average	 than other primary GBM patients (Fig. S3).  Go to: METHODS All clinical information and tissue were obtained with consent and Institutional Review Board approval from the various institutions donating material to this study	 and they were obtained in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Tissue sections were reviewed by board-certified pathologists to ensure that â‰¥50% of the cells used for DNA purification were neoplastic and confirm histopathological diagnosis. Oligonucleotides with the sequences 5â€²-M13-GGCCGATTCGACCTCTCT-3â€² and 5â€²-AGCACCTCGCGGTAGTGG-3â€²	 where M13 is a universal sequencing priming site with sequence 5â€²-tgtaaaacgacggccagt-3â€²	 were used to PCR-amplify the proximal TERT promoter containing C228 and C250 (chr5: 1	295	228; chr5: 1	295	250	 respectively; hg19) for Sanger sequencing using standard methods (44). Primary GBM copy number data as well as ALT status were derived from the data published in refs. 37	45	 and 46	 and OTX2 copy number expression was derived from the data published in ref. 27. Brain tumor patients were treated at the Tisch Brain Tumor Center at Duke. For the purposes of this study	 secondary GBM designates a GBM that was resected >1 y after a prior diagnosis of a lower-grade glioma (grades Iâ€“III)	 and all other GBMs were considered to be primary GBMs. Pediatric GBM samples were defined as those samples occurring before 21 y of age.   																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														
4	29||Heterozygous mutations in the telomerase components TERT	 the reverse transcriptase	 and TERC	 the RNA template	 cause autosomal dominant dyskeratosis congenita due to telomere shortening. Anticipation	 whereby the disease severity increases in succeeding generations due to inheritance of shorter telomeres	 is a feature of this condition. Here we describe 2 families in which 2 TERT mutations are segregating. Both families contain compound heterozygotes. In one case the proband is homozygous for a novel mutation causing a P704S substitution	 while his father's second allele encodes an H412Y mutation. The proband in the second family has mutant alleles Y846C and H876Q. Transfection studies show codominant expression of the mutated alleles with no evidence of a dominant negative effect or of intragenic complementation. Thus in these families the expression of both TERT alleles and the inherited telomere length contribute to the clinical phenotype.  Go to: Introduction Mutations in genes encoding components of the telomerase ribonucleoprotein complex resulting in very short telomeres have been identified in patients with dyskeratosis congenita (DC)	 a rare inherited bone marrow failure syndrome.1â€“6 X-linked DC is caused by mutations in the DKC1 gene	 encoding a protein necessary for the stabilization of the TERC RNA. Individuals with autosomal dominant DC (AD DC) are heterozygous for mutations in the telomerase RNA TERC or the gene encoding the catalytic subunit TERT.2â€“5 In contrast to patients with X-linked DC	 who usually develop severe disease with a high penetrance	 disease penetrance and expressivity in AD DC are highly variable and	 in addition to the gene mutation	 the inheritance of short telomeres is required for the manifestation of the disease.7	8 Here we demonstrate that the inheritance of AD DC may be complex. We report a DC patient homozygous for a TERT mutation and compound heterozygotes in 2 separate families with apparent codominance of the 2 mutations  Go to: Methods Clinical and genetic information was obtained through our ongoing study on the molecular mechanisms of bone marrow failure (http://bmf.im.wustl.edu). The study is approved by the Washington University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board. Informed consent was obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. DNA for mutation analysis was extracted from peripheral blood cells (Qiagen	 Valencia	 CA). Telomere length measurements in peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC) by flow-FISH and direct DNA sequencing were previously described.8 Primers used are shown in Table S1 (available on the Blood website; see the Supplemental Materials link at the top of the online article).  The mutations identified were introduced in the p3.1+ TERT plasmid9 using the QuickChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene	 La Jolla	 CA). Wild-type (WT) or mutant TERT plasmid (4 Î¼g) were transfected into WI-38 VA-13 cells at 80% confluence in the presence of an equal amount of pUC TERC using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen	 Carlsbad	 CA).10 In cotransfection experiments	 2 Î¼g of each mutant TERT plasmid were used. Thirty-six hours after transfection	 telomerase activities were determined in cell lysates at protein concentrations of 40	10	2.5	 and 0.625 ng using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR)â€“based TRAP assay as previously described.11  Go to: Results and discussion Figure 1A shows the pedigrees of families 199 and 284.

Mutation analysis revealed that patient 199.1 is homozygous for a C to T transition in exon 5 of the TERT gene (cDNA nt C2110T) causing a proline to serine substitution at amino acid 704 (P704S). Functional analysis in WI-38 VA-13 cells demonstrated that the TERT P704S mutation severely reduces telomerase activity to 13% of normal (P < .001; Figure 2A). Both parents are heterozygous for the TERT P704S mutation (Figure 1A). Interestingly	 however	 the father carries a second TERT mutation in exon 2. This C1234T mutation (H412Y)	 has been previously described in an unrelated family.3 This mutation reduced telomerase activity to 36% of normal in our transfection experiments (P < .001; Figure 2A). Coexpression of WT TERT with either the P704S or H412Y variants did not show evidence of a dominant negative effect. The coexpression of the 2 TERT mutations resulted in an intermediate telomerase activity of 22% (P < .001; Figure 2B)	 suggesting a synergic effect on telomerase activity and no intragenic complementation. Careful analysis of the family tree revealed that the parents are fourth cousins	 explaining the presence of the TERT P704S mutation in both parents.  Figure 2 Figure 2 Telomerase activity and telomere lengths of wild-type and mutant individuals. (A) In vitro telomerase activity of the mutant TERT proteins in WI-38 VA-13 cells. WI-38 VA-13 cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing the mutant TERT cDNA sequences ... Telomere length measurement in family 199 revealed that patient 199.1 has very short telomeres (below the 1st percentile of the normal telomere length distribution; Figure 2C). Interestingly	 the father (199.2)	 who is compound heterozygous for the TERT P704S and H412Y mutations	 has also very short telomeres	 whereas the mother (199.3)	 who is heterozygous for TERT P704S mutation	 has a normal telomere length.  Patient 284.1 is an 8-year-old girl of European descent	 originally diagnosed with moderate but progressive aplastic anemia. Both of her parents are healthy with no abnormalities in the peripheral blood. Family history was negative for blood diseases	 pulmonary fibrosis	 or cancer.  Mutation analysis revealed 2 different TERT gene sequence alterations. The A2537G in exon 9 (Y846C) and C2628G mutation in exon 10 (H876Q). Further analysis showed that the TERT Y846C mutation was inherited from the mother	 whereas the TERT H876Q mutation was inherited from her father	 indicating that patient 284.1 is a compound heterozygote for the 2 TERT gene mutations (Figure 1A). Both TERT gene mutations result in a significantly reduced telomerase activity after transfection into WI-38 VA-13 cells to 10% (P < .001) and 50% (P < .001) of normal (Figure 2A)	 whereas the cotransfection of the 2 mutants results in a telomerase activity of 38% (P = .004; Figure 2B).  Telomere length in peripheral blood cells from patient 284.1 was very short	 below the 1st percentile of normal and so were those measured in her mother (284.2) and in one of her uncles (284.4)	 both of whom carry the TERT Y846C mutation. Telomere length in her father (284.3) heterozygous for the TERT H876Q mutation was between the 1st and 5th percentile of normal (Figure 2C).  In conclusion	 we have identified 3 novel and 1 recurrent TERT gene mutation in 2 families who were thought to have sporadic DC and idiopathic aplastic anemia. All 4 mutations are hypomorphic mutations	 impairing	 but not eliminating telomerase activity. Homozygous hypomorphic TERT mutations have recently been found to cause disease in 2 consanguineous families.12 Here we demonstrate that in a nonconsanguineous family compound heterozygosity for TERT can cause disease and that the involvement of TERT in the pathogenesis of DC is probably more complex than initially anticipated. Our data indicate that in compound heterozygosity or homozygosity for hypomorphic TERT mutations the mutant alleles are codominant and suggest that severity of telomerase dysfunction and the inheritance of short telomeres determine the clinical phenotype and onset of disease. Codominant inheritance has also been found in one family with 2 hypomorphic TERC gene mutations	13 whereas compound heterozygosity or homozygosity for TERC or TERT null mutations have never been reported	 suggesting that in humans	 in contrast to mice	 biallelic TERC or TERT null mutations are probably not compatible with life. The consideration that both sides of the family may be affected even in nonconsanguineous families might have important implications for the patient in the selection of a potential sibling donor as well as for the prognosis and management of other family members carrying one or 2 of the identified gene mutations.  																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																
4	30||Heterozygous mutations in the telomerase components TERT	 the reverse transcriptase	 and TERC	 the RNA template	 cause autosomal dominant dyskeratosis congenita due to telomere shortening. Anticipation	 whereby the disease severity increases in succeeding generations due to inheritance of shorter telomeres	 is a feature of this condition. Here we describe 2 families in which 2 TERT mutations are segregating. Both families contain compound heterozygotes. In one case the proband is homozygous for a novel mutation causing a P704S substitution	 while his father's second allele encodes an H412Y mutation. The proband in the second family has mutant alleles Y846C and H876Q. Transfection studies show codominant expression of the mutated alleles with no evidence of a dominant negative effect or of intragenic complementation. Thus in these families the expression of both TERT alleles and the inherited telomere length contribute to the clinical phenotype.  Go to: Introduction Mutations in genes encoding components of the telomerase ribonucleoprotein complex resulting in very short telomeres have been identified in patients with dyskeratosis congenita (DC)	 a rare inherited bone marrow failure syndrome.1â€“6 X-linked DC is caused by mutations in the DKC1 gene	 encoding a protein necessary for the stabilization of the TERC RNA. Individuals with autosomal dominant DC (AD DC) are heterozygous for mutations in the telomerase RNA TERC or the gene encoding the catalytic subunit TERT.2â€“5 In contrast to patients with X-linked DC	 who usually develop severe disease with a high penetrance	 disease penetrance and expressivity in AD DC are highly variable and	 in addition to the gene mutation	 the inheritance of short telomeres is required for the manifestation of the disease.7	8 Here we demonstrate that the inheritance of AD DC may be complex. We report a DC patient homozygous for a TERT mutation and compound heterozygotes in 2 separate families with apparent codominance of the 2 mutations  Go to: Methods Clinical and genetic information was obtained through our ongoing study on the molecular mechanisms of bone marrow failure (http://bmf.im.wustl.edu). The study is approved by the Washington University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board. Informed consent was obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. DNA for mutation analysis was extracted from peripheral blood cells (Qiagen	 Valencia	 CA). Telomere length measurements in peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC) by flow-FISH and direct DNA sequencing were previously described.8 Primers used are shown in Table S1 (available on the Blood website; see the Supplemental Materials link at the top of the online article).  The mutations identified were introduced in the p3.1+ TERT plasmid9 using the QuickChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene	 La Jolla	 CA). Wild-type (WT) or mutant TERT plasmid (4 Î¼g) were transfected into WI-38 VA-13 cells at 80% confluence in the presence of an equal amount of pUC TERC using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen	 Carlsbad	 CA).10 In cotransfection experiments	 2 Î¼g of each mutant TERT plasmid were used. Thirty-six hours after transfection	 telomerase activities were determined in cell lysates at protein concentrations of 40	10	2.5	 and 0.625 ng using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR)â€“based TRAP assay as previously described.11  Go to: Results and discussion Figure 1A shows the pedigrees of families 199 and 284.

His clinical manifestations include short stature; elfin appearance; esophageal stricture; leukoplakia of the buccal mucosa	 anus	 and penis; abnormal pigmentation of his neck	 trunk	 and back; hyperkeratosis of his palms; ridged fingernails; avascular necrosis of both hips; tooth loss; chronic diarrhea; learning difficulties; pulmonary infiltrates; and progressive bone marrow failure (Figure 1B). His 61-year-old father was diagnosed with osteoporosis at the age of 60. His 60-year-old mother is healthy. Both parents have normal peripheral blood cell counts. The paternal grandmother (age	 84 years) has a history of anemia	 osteoporosis	 and pulmonary fibrosis. The maternal grandmother was reported to have died at the age of 60 years because of pulmonary fibrosis.

7	31||Sequencing studies have identified many recurrent coding mutations in human cancer genes; however	 highly recurrent mutations involving regulatory regions have rarely been observed. Here we describe two independent mutations within the TERT core promoter that	 when taken together	 were observed in 71% (50 of 70) of melanomas and generate de novo consensus ETS binding motifs. Reporter assays showed that these mutations increase transcriptional activity from the TERT promoter by 2â€“4-fold. Examination of cancer cell lines derived from diverse tumor types revealed the same mutations in 16% (24 of 150) of cases	 with preliminary evidence of elevated frequency in bladder and hepatocellular cancer cells. Thus	 somatic mutations in regulatory regions of the genome may represent an important tumorigenic mechanism.  Systematic characterization of human cancer genomes has led to the discovery of a wide range of mutated genes that contribute to tumor development and progression. Most of the somatic mutations in tumors reside within the protein-coding regions of genes or at splice junctions. To determine whether tumor genomes harbor recurrent mutations outside of protein-coding regions	 we systematically queried noncoding somatic mutations using published whole-genome sequencing data.  Analysis of whole-genome sequencing data from malignant melanomas (1	 2) revealed two somatic telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene promoter mutations in 17 of 19 (89%) cases examined. The average sequence coverage at the TERT promoter locus was 30-fold in normal samples and 60-fold in tumor samples (fig. S1A). Each of these promoter mutations resulted in a cytidine-to-thymidine transition at a dipyrimidine motif indicative of ultraviolet (UV) lightâ€“induced damage (chr5	1	295	228 C>T and 1	295	250 C>T; hereafter termed C228T and C250T	 respectively)	 and both mutations localized within 100 base pairs (bp) of the TERT transcriptional start site (TSS) (mean allelic fraction	 0.32; range	 0.07 to 0.55) (table S1). We validated these mutations by means of polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing tumor/normal sample pairs from both the discovery set (Fig. 1A and fig. S1	 B and C) and an extension set of 51 additional melanoma tumor/normal sample pairs. Within this extension set	 33 tumors (65%) harbored one of the mutations. Moreover	 the mutations were mutually exclusive in both the discovery and extension sets (P = 5.4 Ã— 10âˆ’7	 Fisherâ€™s one-sided exact test). Two tumors with a C228T transition also contained an adjacent C>T transition (at position chr5	1	295	229)	 which is indicative of a dinucleotide CC>TT transition. Together	 these TERT promoter mutations were observed in 50 of 70 (71%; 95% confidence interval: 59 to 82%	 Clopper-Pearson method) melanomas examined (Fig. 1B and table S1).  Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Identification of TERT promoter mutations in melanoma and cancer cell lines Both C228T and C250T generated an identical 11-bp nucleotide stretch (5â€²-CCCCTTCCGGG-3â€²) containing a consensus binding site for E-twenty-six (ETS) transcription factors (GGAA	 reverse complement) within the TERT promoter region. Because ETS transcription factors may become activated through dysregulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) signaling	 we hypothesized that these promoter mutations might augment gene expression. To test this hypothesis	 we used a reporter assay system in which the relevant portion of the mutant or wild-type TERT core promoter was cloned upstream of the firefly luciferase gene (2). Here	 we tested both a core promoter fragment (âˆ’132 to +5 relative to the TSS) and the full core promoter (âˆ’200 to +73). In comparison to the wild-type TERT promoter	 both mutations conferred approximately two- to fourfold increased transcriptional activity in five distinct cell line contexts (Fig. 1C and fig. S1D). Thus	 each mutation was capable of augmenting transcriptional activity from the TERT promoter.  To investigate whether similar TERT promoter mutations occur in other cancer types	 we examined sequencing data from this locus in 150 cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) (3). Overall	 24 CCLE lines (16%) contained either C228T or C250T (mean allelic fraction	 0.61; range	 0.17 to 1.00) (table S1). An increased frequency in melanoma was again noted (five of six lines tested)	 with additional evidence suggesting possible heightened prevalence (>25%; one-sided 95% confidence interval) in bladder (three of three lines) and hepatocellular cancer cell lines (four of six lines) (Fig. 1D).  Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that these promoter mutations may function as driver events that contribute to oncogenesis through TERT dysregulation and undergo positive selection	 at least in human melanoma. First	 the TERT promoter mutations showed a combined frequency that exceeded those of BRAF and NRAS mutations	 which activate known melanoma driver oncogenes (4	 5). In an analysis restricted to somatic mutations present at an allelic fraction of 0.2 or greater [to reduce artifacts of mutation calling (1)]	 the four most recurrent melanoma nucleotide substitutions included BRAF [chr7	140	453	136 A>T (V600E)]	 NRAS [chr1	115	256	529 T>C (Q61R)]	 and the TERT core promoter mutations C228T and C250T. Second	 although highly recurrent	 C228T and C250T occurred in a wholly mutually exclusive fashion. This suggests the possibility that the mutations might be functionally redundant. Third	 the absence of other recurrent somatic mutations in the 3 kb upstream of the TERT transcription start site in the queried melanomas (1) coupled with the absence of the described TERT promoter mutations in 24 lung adenocarcinomas with comparably high somatic mutation rates (6) reduces the possibility that these recurrent TERT promoter mutations are solely due to an increased background mutation rate at this locus. Although the role of telomerase in tumorigenesis is well established	 details regarding its dysregulation in cancer cells remain incompletely understood	 particularly in melanoma (7). The TERT promoter mutations identified here may link telomerase gene regulation and tumorigenic activation in this malignancy. The high prevalence of C228T and C250T suggests that these TERT promoter mutations may comprise early genetic events in the genesis of melanoma and other cancer types. Although TERT expression alone is not sufficient to bypass oncogene-induced senescence	 genomic TERT activation may potentiate mechanisms by which melanocytes achieve immortalization in the setting of oncogenic mutations (8). These results therefore suggest that renewed efforts to develop clinically effective telomerase inhibitors may be warranted.  At the same time	 promoter mutations likely represent only one potential mechanism of TERT reactivation in a subset of human cancers. Indeed	 recurrent chromosomal copy gains spanning the TERT locus have been described previously for several cancers	 including melanoma (9	 10).  Highly recurrent somatic mutations within a cancer gene promoter region have not previously been described. Similarly	 the de novo mutational generation of transcription factor binding motifs in tumor genomes was heretofore unknown	 although an ETS transcription factor binding motif was previously associated with a single-nucleotide polymorphism insertion at the MMP-1 locus (11). Together	 these findings raise the possibility that recurrent somatic mutations involving regulatory regions	 in addition to coding sequences	 may represent important driver events in cancer.

We investigated a melanoma-prone family through linkage analysis and high-throughput sequencing and identified a disease-segregating germline mutation in the promoter of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene	 which encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase. The mutation creates a new binding motif for Ets transcription factors and ternary complex factors (TCFs) near the transcription start and	 in reporter gene assays	 caused up to twofold increase in transcription. We then screened the TERT promoter in sporadic melanoma and observed recurrent ultraviolet signature somatic mutations in 125 of 168 (74%) of human cell lines derived from metastatic melanomas	 45 of 53 corresponding metastatic tumor tissues (85%)	 and 25 of 77 (33%) primary melanomas. The majority of those mutations occurred at two positions in the TERT promoter and also generated binding motifs for Ets/TCF transcription factors. The identification of germline mutations that cosegregate with disease in cancerprone families often provides genetic and mechanistic insights into the more common	 sporadically arising cancers. In a study of cutaneous melanoma	 the most malignant skin cancer	 we investigated a large pedigree with 14 related melanoma patients who were not carriers of germline mutations in CDKN2A or CDK4	 two known melanoma genes (Fig. 1). Multipoint linkage analysis showed a possible 2.2-Mb linkage region on chromosome 5p with maximal logarithm of the odds ratio for linkage scores of 2.35 at rs1379917 and 2.45 at rs1968011. Target-enriched high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of the region was carried out on constitutional DNA from the four affected and four unaffected members of the family with an average coverage between 55- and 108-fold (table S1) (1). The HTS data revealed a single promoter variant	 three intronic variants	 and three nongene variants previously unknown and unique to the DNA sequences of the affected individuals (table S2). The disease segregating variants	 seven in total	 were validated by Sanger sequencing of DNA from the individuals sequenced by HTS and of DNA from additional unaffected members of the family. The new variants were also detected in an unaffected member (754	 table S3)	 who was 36 years old and carried multiple nevi. DNA from affected individuals other than those sequenced by HTS was not available for testing. Of the seven unique variants identified	 one variant (T>G)	 was located in the promoter at â€“57 base pairs (bp) from ATG translation start site of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT ) gene. The TERT gene encodes the catalytic reverse transcriptase subunit of telomerase	 the ribonucleoprotein complex that maintains telomere length. The nucleotide change in the sequence CCTGAA>CCGGAA creates a new binding motif for Ets transcription factors	 with a general recognition motif GGA(A/T). Beyond the general motif for Ets transcription factors	 the familial mutation also generates a binding motif	 CCGGAA	 for the ternary complex factors (TCFs) Elk1 and Elk4 (2	 3). To exclude the possibility that the detected promoter mutation in TERT is a common germline variant	 we screened germline DNA from 140 sporadic melanoma cases and 165 healthy controls	 and none carried the variant. Screening of DNA from index cases from 34 Spanish melanoma families also did not show any mutations. No carriers were found in dbSNP and the 1000 Genomes databases (data available for 18 individuals were obtained from Ensembl). The familial mutation in the TERT promoter was in complete allelic linkage with a common polymorphism rs2853669 (G>A) at â€“246 bp upstream from the ATG start site (table S3). In previous work	 this polymorphism was reported to disrupt an Ets binding site	 and it was associated with low telomerase activity in patients with nonâ€“ small cell lung cancer (4). In luciferase reporter gene assays	 we found that the activity of constructs containing the mutation at â€“57 bp of the TERT promoter was increased 1.5-fold and 1.2- fold over the wild-type construct in Ma-Mel-86a and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells	 respectively. A construct with both the TERT mutation and the variant allele of the rs2853669 polymorphism showed a 2.2-fold increase in promoter activity in Ma-Mel-86a and and 1.3-fold increase in HEK293 cells (mean from three measurements; details in supplementary text and fig. S1). The germline occurrence of the promoter mutation	 creating an Ets/TCF motif	 can result in modification of TERT expression in all tissues expressing Ets/TCF. Highest staining for the TCF Elk1 protein has been reported in female-specific tissues	 such as ovary and placenta. The increased expression of TCF Elk1 protein in female-specific tissues may cause gender-related differences in 1 Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology	 German Cancer Research Center	 Im Neuenheimer Feld 580	 69120 Heidelberg	 Germany. 2 Department of Dermatology	 University Hospital Essen	 45122 Essen	 Germany. 3 Institute of Human Genetics	 University of Heidelberg	 69120 Heidelberg	 Germany. 4 Department of Dermatology	 Instituto Valenciano de Oncologia	 Valencia	 Spain. 5 Center for Primary Health Care Research	 Lund University	 MalmÃ¶	 Sweden. *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Two affected members of the family developed several different types of cancer (marked with # in Fig. 1). One affected individual presented with ovarian cancer at age 27 and melanoma at age 30. Another individual was diagnosed with melanoma at age 20; later she developed ovarian cancer	 renal cell carcinoma	 bladder cancer	 mammary carcinoma	 and finally bronchial carcinoma	 leading to her death at age 50. The mutation in the melanoma-prone family prompted us to screen melanoma cell lines derived from sporadic cases of metastatic melanoma. None of the cell lines carried the mutation detected in the family. However	 we identified recurrent ultraviolet (UV)â€“signature mutations in the TERT core promoter in 74% (125 of 168) of the cell lines. The mutations were located within a 49-bp region starting from â€“100 bp upstream of the ATG start site (Table 1	 Fig. 2	 fig. S2	 and table S4). There were two frequent mutations at â€“124 bp (G>A; C>T on opposite strand) and â€“146 bp (G>A); these mutations were mutually exclusive and occurred in 27 and 38% of cell lines	 respectively. Two tandem GG>AA (CC>TT) mutations at positions â€“124/â€“125 bp and â€“138/â€“139 bp were observed at a frequency of 9%. The tandem mutation at positions â€“138/â€“139 bp could also be generated by a single-base mutation at â€“138 bp	 because the base change at â€“139 bp has been reported as a rare polymorphism (rs35550267). The two most frequent single-base mutations as well as the two tandem mutations also result in the creation of Ets/TCF binding motifs. Mutations were confirmed in 45 of 53 (85%) available metastasized tumors corresponding to the cell lines. The somatic nature of the mutations was shown by the absence of mutations in corresponding DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells available from 23 patients. Somatic mutations in the TERT promoter were more frequent than the BRAF mutations (53%	 90 of 169)	 CDKN2A alterations (50%	 84 of 169)	 and NRAS mutations (23%	 38 of 169; fig. S3). The occurrence of concomitant mutations in the TERT promoter and BRAF was more frequent (47%) than by random chance (40%) with an odds ratio (OR) of 3.2 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3 to 8.2]. Concomitant mutations in TERT	 BRAF	 and CDKN2Awere observed in 30% of cell lines compared with the expected frequency of such occurrence of 9% (OR 5.6	 95% CI 2.4 to 13.8). The high recurrence and specificity of the TERT promoter mutations	 together with the preliminary evidence from reporter assays that they have a functional effect on transcription	 suggest that these mutations are driver rather than passenger events. Extensive functional studies will be required to validate this hypothesis. The TERT promoter mutations were also detected in 25 out of 77 (33%) paraffin embedded primary melanoma tumors (Table 1 and table S5) at â€“124 bp (7/77; 9%) and â€“146 bp (5/77; 7%). Four primary tumors carried the GG>AA tandem mutations at â€“124/â€“125 bp	 and eight primary tumors carried the GG>AA tandem mutations at â€“138/â€“139 bp. Reduced sensitivity to detect mutations in paraffin-embedded primary tumors because of contaminating normal cells cannot be ruled out. Primary tumors harbored five additional mutations in the TERT promoter	 which were not present in metastases	 and those did not generate Ets/TCF binding motifs. We also screened DNA extracted from 25 melanocytic nevi and only one carried a mutation at â€“101 bp	 which did not create an Ets/TCF motif. For both primary tumors and melanocytic nevi	 matched normal control DNA was not available for testing. The TERT coding region has been reported to be somatically mutated in 1% of cancers (14 cancer types	 1271 unique samples) (6). Mutations creating Ets/TCF binding motifs in the TERT promoter in melanoma have not been described in earlier sequencing projects. TCFs are a subfamily of Ets transcription factors; two members of this subfamily	 Elk1 and Elk4	 are downstream targets of BRAF and regulate the expression of many genes (7â€“11). Conceivably	 TCF may represent a link between telomerase activity and the frequent BRAF activating mutations in melanoma (fig. S4) (12	 13). Lastly	 whether TERT promoter mutations occur in other cancer types remains to be determined. We did not detect these mutations in a screen of 22 esophageal squamous cell c  Reactivation of telomerase has been implicated in human tumorigenesis	 but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we report the presence of recurrent somatic mutations in the TERT promoter in cancers of the central nervous system (43%)	 bladder (59%)	 thyroid (follicular cell-derived	 10%) and skin (melanoma	 29%). In thyroid cancers	 the presence of TERT promoter mutations (when occurring together with BRAF mutations) is significantly associated with higher TERT mRNA expression	 and in glioblastoma we find a trend for increased telomerase expression in cases harbouring TERT promoter mutations. Both in thyroid cancers and glioblastoma	 TERT promoter mutations are significantly associated with older age of the patients. Our results show that TERT promoter mutations are relatively frequent in specific types of human cancers	 where they lead to enhanced expression of telomerase.

Reactivation or re-expression of telomerase is referred to be a widespread feature in human cancers	 although the genetic basis remains poorly understood in many cancer types. Somatic mutations in the coding region of TERT (human telomerase reverse transcriptase) are infrequent in human tumours	 but germline and somatic mutations in TERT promoter were recently found in a high percentage of human melanomas and human cancer cell lines1	2. Such mutations occurred in two hotspot positions	 located  124 and  146 bp upstream from the ATG start site (  124 G4A and  146 G4A	 C4T on opposite strand) and conferred enhanced TERT promoter activity1	2	 by putatively generating a consensus binding site (GGAA) for ETS transcription factors within the TERT promoter region1	2. Our aim was to investigate whether the aforementioned TERT promoter mutations were present in cancer types other than melanoma	 having for that matter screened 741 primary tumours from the thyroid	 kidney	 bladder	 gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST)	 adrenal medulla (phaeochromocytomas) and central nervous system (CNS). Besides skin melanoma	 we have also included ocular melanoma (not studied in the previous reports)	 benign lesions of the thyroid and skin and 58 human cancer-derived cell lines. Our results highlight TERT promoter mutations as frequent events in specific types of human cancers. Results TERT mutations in tumours and cell lines. Overall	 TERT promoter mutations were found in 142 (19%) human tumour samples (Table 1; Fig. 1a) and 14 (24%) human cell lines (Fig. 1b; Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). The  124-bp mutation was the most frequent	 being present in 99 cases	 whereas the  146- bp mutation was present in 43 cases. The  124 G4A and  146 G4A mutations were found in a mutually exclusive fashion. Two tandem GG4AA mutations at positions  124/  125 and  138/  139 bp were observed in one cell line each (Supplementary Fig. S1 and Supplementary Table S1). TERT promoter mutations were not detected in normal thyroid tissue nor in benign lesions (nevi	 thyroiditis	 goitres and adenomas). No mutations were detected in 26 kidney cancers	 17 phaeochromocytomas and 36 GISTs. TERT mutations in melanoma. We have analysed both skin and ocular melanomas	 a type of melanoma that was not previously studied1	2. TERT mutations were present in 16 out of 56 (29%) skin melanomas	 but absent in the 25 ocular melanomas (Table 1). All the four skin melanoma-derived cell lines but none of the six ocular melanoma-derived cell lines harboured TERT mutations (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table S1). Ten out of 16 (63%) skin melanomas with TERT mutation also harboured the BRAFV600E mutation	 whereas the BRAF mutation was present in 9 out of 38 (24%) melanomas without TERT mutation (P Â¼ 0.01	 Fisherâ€™s exact test	 two-sided) (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Supplementary Table S3). TERT mutations in CNS tumours. In CNS tumours	 TERT promoter mutations were found in 43% (51/118) of all cases with an equal prevalence of both mutations (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S4). The frequency of TERT mutations was different according to the tumour histology and grade (Fig. 1c): although pilocytic astrocytomas (World Health Organization (WHO) grade 1) and diffuse astrocytoma (WHO grade 2) showed a lower frequency of mutations (8% and 15%	 respectively)	 the most aggressive form	 glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; WHO grade 4)	 present the highest frequency of TERT mutations (62%). Oligodendrogliomas (WHO grade 2) and anaplastic oligodendrogliomas (WHO grade 3) also harboured a high frequency of TERT mutations (45% and 54%	 respectively). The presence of TERT mutations was significantly associated with a higher mean age at diagnosis (Supplementary Table S5) in CNS patients as a whole (Po0.0001; Mannâ€“Whitney test	 twotailed) and also in GBM patients only (P Â¼ 0.0247; Mannâ€“ Whitney test	 two-tailed); in oligodendroglioma patients	 we found the same trend	 although not statistically significant (P Â¼ 0.0709; Mannâ€“Whitney test	 two-tailed). In addition	 we observed that	 in a subset of 14 GBM (8 TERT wild-type tumours and 6 TERT-mutated tumours)	 the tumours with TERT mutations showed a trend to increased immunohistochemistry (IHC) expression of telomerase	 although this difference was not statistically significant (P Â¼ 0.4250; Mannâ€“Whitney test	 two-tailed) (Fig. 2). TERT mutations in thyroid cancer. We analysed a large series of follicular cell-derived thyroid samples including normal thyroid (n Â¼ 27)	 benign (n Â¼ 81) and malignant lesions (n Â¼ 263) (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S6). TERT mutations were only detected in malignant tumours (10%) (Fig. 1d)	 namely in Table 1 | Prevalence of TERT promoter recurrent mutations in human cancers.

Within the group of PTC	 TERT mutations were detected to be associated to the so-called conventional PTC (cPTC) (11%).The majority of TERT-mutated thyroid cancers harboured the  124 G4A mutation (22 out of 27 cases) (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Table S7). In thyroid cancer patients	 TERT mutations were significantly associated with guarded prognosis features such as larger tumours (P Â¼ 0.008; Mannâ€“Whitney test	 two-tailed)	 older patients (Po0.0001; Mannâ€“Whitney test	 two-tailed) and male gender (P Â¼ 0.0312; Fisherâ€™s exact test	 two-sided) (Supplementary Table S5). After histotype stratification	 such correlations were only kept in the group of cPTC where we also found significant associations with lymph node metastasis (P Â¼ 0.0318; Fisherâ€™s exact test	 two-sided) and BRAFV600E mutation (P Â¼ 0.001; Fisherâ€™s exact test	 two-sided) (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Supplementary Table S8).

In bladder cancer	 TERT mutations were frequently detected (48/82; 59%) both in lowgrade tumours (14/21; 67%) and high-grade tumours (34/61; 56%) (Table 1 and Fig. 1e; Supplementary Table S9). The  124 G4A mutation was present in 30 cases	 whereas the  146 G4A was found in 18 cases. No association was found between the presence of the mutation and the age of the patients. No mutations were detected in 26 kidney cancers	 17 phaeochromocytoma and 36 GISTs (Supplementary Tables S10	 S11 and S12	 respectively). Discussion Recent findings have described that TERT promoter mutations arise as a novel mechanism of telomerase reactivation/expression in human cancers1	2. In this work	 we report for the first time the presence of these mutations in different histotypes of thyroid cancer	 and our results validate the findings reported by others in melanoma	 bladder and gliomas1â€“3. Furthermore	 we present for the first time evidence showing that TERT promoter mutations are significantly associated with increased TERT mRNA expression in thyroid cancers. We also found a trend for increased telomerase expression in cases of GBM harbouring TERT promoter mutations. In thyroid cancers	 TERT mRNA was particularly high in cases harbouring both TERT and BRAF mutations. The location of these mutations in the TERT promoter	 rather than the coding region of the gene	 creating additional binding sites for transcription factors	 represents also a novel mechanism of genetic activation in cancer. The frequency of TERT mutations we detected in skin melanomas is similar to that reported by Horn et al.1 in primary melanomas (33%)	 but lower than the frequency found by the same authors in metastatic melanomas (85%) and by Huang et al.2 in a series of 70 melanomas and short-term cultures1	2. In our series	 we have analysed few metastatic melanomas that did not show a significantly higher percentage of TERT mutations. As our series is too small to allow a conclusion	 it remains to be verified if there is an increased frequency of TERT mutations in metastatic melanomas	 as suggested by previous reports1	2. We have confirmed	 in skin melanomas	 the significant association between TERT and BRAF mutations	 as previously advanced by Horn et al.1	 which we now also demonstrate in thyroid cancers. Interestingly	 in benign nevi	 which frequently harbour BRAF mutations	 we did not detect TERT mutations. This finding	 together with the high frequency of TERT mutations in metastatic melanomas1	 suggests that	 although BRAF mutations are thought to be an early event in melanoma genesis	 TERT mutations may occur at a later stage. No TERT promoter mutations were found in ocular melanomas	 which	 at variance with skin melanomas	 harbour GNAQ mutations instead of BRAF mutations4	5. Our results further support the assumption that ocular melanomas result from different etiopathogenic mechanism than skin melanomas5	6. Our data on CNS tumours indicate that TERT promoter mutations are frequent events in gliomas	 particularly in GBM where the highest mutation frequency was found. It has been shown that TERT mutations conferred enhanced TERT promoter activity in vitro1	2; our findings fit with this assumption because we observed that GBM with TERT promoter mutations appear to display increased telomerase expression	 despite the limited sensitivity of IHC and the low number of cases analysed. Our results are also in concordance with those of Lotsch et al.7 who reported that 60% of GBMs were positive for TERT mRNA and telomerase activity7. It will be interesting to assess whether the GBM positive for telomerase activity described by Lotsch et al.7 also harbour TERT promoter mutations. Our findings also indicate that TERT mutations are associated with older patients	 in accordance with a recent report3. The high frequency of TERT mutations in CNS tumours	 particularly in intermediate and high-grade tumours	 opens a window for new approaches in the therapy of CNS tumours. In thyroid cancer	 TERT mutations were only found in follicular cell-derived cancers (PTC	 follicular thyroid carcinoma	 poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma). No mutations were detected in medullary thyroid carcinomas	 as described by Killela et al.3	 nor in normal thyroid and benign lesions	 such as goitre	 adenomas or thyroiditis; this finding fits with previous studies that reported telomerase expression in malignant lesions and not in normal tissue or hyperplastic lesions8	9.

In cPTC	 TERT mutations were associated with BRAF mutation	 highlighting the coexistence of activation of BRAF and TERT	 previously reported in melanoma1 (Supplementary Fig. S2). Our results reinforce the hypothesis of a link between BRAF activation and telomerase expression	 which can be mediated by transcription factors binding to the newly created consensus binding sites	 as previously advanced by Horn et al.1. Both in thyroid carcinoma and melanoma	 it seems that a â€˜backgroundâ€™ status of activated BRAF enhances the effects of TERT promoter mutation. Our results in TERT mRNA expression strengthen this assumption	 showing	 for the first time	 an increased TERT expression in tumours harbouring BRAF and TERT mutation (Fig. 3). Further observational and mechanistic studies are needed to clarify these points. TERT alterations seem to constitute an early and frequent event in bladder cancer. These findings fit with the high prevalence of telomerase activity previously described in bladder tumours10. The recurrent hotspot mutations in TERT were advanced to be	 in melanomas	 induced by ultraviolet radiation2. Bladder is a target for several chemical carcinogens; it remains to be found whether TERT mutations can also result from the action of such agents. The identification of TERT mutations in urine may provide a biomarker for early diagnosis and monitoring of bladder cancer. No TERT mutations were detected in kidney cancers	 nor in 17 phaeochromocytoma and 36 GISTs. The underlying reasons for the tissue specificity of TERT mutations remain to be clarified. We can hypothesize that TERT mutations can be present in two settings. As described by Killela et al.3	 TERT mutations can be relevant in tissues with relative low rates of self-renewal	 which fits with our findings in follicular cell-derived thyroid cancer and gliomas where they are associated with the older age of the patients. On the other hand	 these mutations can also result from environmental factors such as ultraviolet radiation and chemical carcinogens as suggested by their high frequency in melanoma	 bladder and tongue1â€“3. In summary	 our data identify TERT mutations as common events in human cancers and support the assumption that TERT promoter mutations may be one of the mechanisms that underlies telomerase reactivation in several types of human tumours.  Introduction The telomere sequences at the chromosomal ends	 composed of tandem repeats of TTAGGG	 are protected by a number of molecules that constitute the capping Shelterin complex [1 ;  2]. The incomplete replication due to limitations of the process	 called â€˜end-replication problemâ€™	 results in shortening of telomeres in each successive mitotic cell division that eventually leads to replicative senescence referred to as the â€˜Hayflick limitâ€™ [3; 4 ;  5]. Maintenance of telomere repeat length is dependent on sustained expression of telomerase holoenzyme that adds de novo repeat units at the end of each replication cycle [ 6 ;  7]. Progressive attrition of telomeres is also defined as one of the hallmarks of aging of organisms [ 8 ;  9]. Cancer cells	 characteristically	 acquire infinite capability to divide through maintenance of telomeres by sustained expression of telomerase or in its absence by an alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanism [ 10; 11; 12; 13; 14 ;  15â€¢â€¢].  Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase that together with a RNA component	 TERC	 maintains genomic integrity by telomere elongation [ 16]. Though TERT and TERC are sufficient for in vitro telomerase activity	 the in vivo telomerase functioning requires additional components that associate with TERT and TERC	 to form the holoenzyme [ 17 ;  18]. Those include dyskerin (DKC)	 NOP10 ribonucleoprotein (NOP10)	 GAR1 ribonucleoprotein homolog (yeast) (GAR1)	 NHP2 ribonucleoprotein (NHP2)	 reptin and pontin [ 11; 19; 20; 21 ;  22].  Deregulation of telomerase has been shown to be a ubiquitous feature in human cancers with over 90% of cancers showing an upregulation of the enzyme [11; 23 ;  24]. The telomerase activity is dependent on a number of factors	 regulated at various stages	 which include gene transcription	 mRNA splicing	 maturation and modifications of TERT and TERC	 transport and localization of those components and assembly of active telomerase ribonucleoprotein to telomeres [ 4; 5; 16; 20; 21; 25; 26 ;  27]. The catalytic component TERT acts as a determinant of telomerase activity and its transcription is repressed in most of the somatic cells with the exception of proliferative cells of self-renewing tissues [ 28; 29 ;  30]. An increased expression of TERT has been consistently demonstrated to be a fundamental requirement for cellular transformation [ 4; 31; 32; 33; 34â€¢ ;  35].  The mechanism of TERT upregulation in cancers had been attributed to several mechanisms including epigenetic deregulation as well as genetic amplification of the locus containing TERT gene [ 36 ;  37]. In the absence of any evidence of a definite mechanism	 the telomerase activity in tumor cells has been attributed to the assumption of stem cells being the progenitors in all cancers [38]. The normal stem cells in self-renewing tissues retain telomerase throughout lifetime replication thus abrogating a requirement for a positive selection [6]. The recently discovered TERT promoter mutations add a new dimension to the acquisition of telomerase activity in human cancers. In this review we provide an overview and possible implications of the newly discovered mutations in the promoter of the TERT gene in a wide range of cancers.  Structure and regulation of the TERT promoter The human TERT gene is located on chromosome 5p15.33 and the promoter region of the gene is considered to be the most important regulatory element for telomerase expression. The TERT promoter contains binding motifs for several factors that regulate the gene transcription and distinctly lacks a TATA box or a similar sequence [ 39; 40; 41; 42 ;  43]. The core promoter region consists of 260 base pairs with several transcription-factor binding sites that include E-boxes where c-Myc has been confirmed to bind and activate the transcription [ 44; 45; 46; 47 ;  48]. BRCA1 in conjunction with N-Myc interacting protein (Nmi) forms a complex with c-Myc and inhibits TERT promoter activity	 that property is lost in some mutant forms of BRCA1 [ 49]. Other sequence elements in TERT promoter include GC-boxes	 which are binding sites for zinc finger transcription factor	 Sp1 [ 4 ;  45]. Transcription of the TERT gene is also regulated by various hormones	 cytokines and oncogenes [ 45]. Several repressors of the TERT transcription are also known. p53 has been shown to downregulate TERT transcription in a Sp1-dependent manner [ 50]. Ets transcription factors that comprise over 30 members are prominently associated with telomerase activation [ 42 ;  51]. Ets2 has been shown to form a complex with c-Myc in a breast cancer cell line [ 44 ;  51]. Ets transcription factors are also shown to be stimulated by oncogenes EGF	 Her2/Nez	 Ras and Raf [ 52 ;  53]. The activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressors are known to account for cellular immortalization through induction of TERT transcription [ 54]. The high GC content around the transcription start site of the TERT promoter confers epigenetic regulation through methylation and chromatin remodeling [ 37 ;  55].  TERT promoter mutations in human cancers A discovery of a high-penetrant disease-segregating causal germline mutation in a melanoma family and highly specific and recurrent somatic mutations in tumors from unrelated patients in the TERT promoter has likely provided a definite mechanism for cancer-specific TERT activation [ 56â€¢â€¢ ;  57â€¢â€¢]. Two independent studies using diverse approaches discovered non-coding mutations	 mainly at two residues	 within the core promoter region of the TERT gene. One study was based on the identification of a causal gene mutation in a large melanoma pedigree where affected individuals presented a severe form of the disease with an early age of onset. The linkage analysis identified a 2.2 megabase telomeric region on chromosome 5p that included TERT along with more than 80 other genes [ 56â€¢â€¢]. Sequencing of the entire stretch of DNA region in the family resulted in identification of a disease segregating A > C (T > G) single base change at âˆ’57 bp (Chr 5: 1	295	161 hg19 coordinate) from ATG start site. The germline mutation was present in affected and absent in unaffected individuals in the family with the exception of one. Subsequent screening of cell lines derived from melanoma metastases from unrelated patients led to the detection of recurrent and mutually exclusive somatic mutations at two residues âˆ’124 and âˆ’146 from the ATG start site in the TERT promoter [ 56â€¢â€¢]. Serendipitously	 an independent study using a whole genome sequencing approach also reported the recurrent somatic TERT promoter mutations at the same positions [ 57â€¢â€¢]. Other mutations detected in TERT promoter included the CC > TT tandem mutations at âˆ’124/âˆ’125 and âˆ’138/âˆ’139 bp from ATG start site. The germline and somatic mutations in the non-coding part of the TERT gene were defined by common salient features. One of the underlying features included a de novo creation of CCGGAA/T general binding motifs for E-twenty six/ternary complex factors (Ets/TCF) transcription factors	 which differed from pre-existing GGAA/T Ets binding sites within the TERT promoter ( Figure 1). The somatic mutations at both positions being C > T and the additional detection of CC > TT tandem mutations in a proportion of tumors augmented the evidence for the UV-origin of tumor specific nucleotide changes in melanoma as shown previously in studies based on whole genome sequencing [58â€¢]. Interestingly	 the mutations detected in the TERT promoter in melanoma were more frequent than those in the BRAF gene.  Schematic representation of a part of the TERT promoter that contains residues	 ... Figure 1.  Schematic representation of a part of the TERT promoter that contains residues	 which are affected by a germline mutation in a melanoma family at the position âˆ’57 bp and recurrent somatic mutations at the positions âˆ’124 and âˆ’146 bp from the ATG start site. The mutations create CCGGAA/T binding motif for Ets/TCF transcription factors that results in an increased TERT expression. Pre-existing binding sites for other transcriptions factors are shown above the sequence. Figure options It was also observed that the TERT promoter mutations tend to occur more often than expected by chance in tumors with either BRAF mutations (odds ratio [OR] 3.2	 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3â€“8.2) or with concomitant alterations in both BRAF and CDKN2A (OR 5.6	 95% CI 2.4â€“13.8) [ 56â€¢â€¢]. BRAF mutations	 due to occurrence and role in development of melanocytic nevi	 are considered as the driver genetic lesions in melanoma [ 56â€¢â€¢; 59â€¢ ;  60]. The loss of CDKN2A has been suggested to play a role in the escape of melanocytes from BRAF induced senescence [61]. The acquisition of TERT promoter mutations can be hypothesized to facilitate stabilization of the transformed genome through reversal of telomeric loss. Most melanocytic nevi carry BRAF mutations	 whereas TERT promoter mutations and CDKN2A alterations are detected only in primary melanoma and beyond [ 56â€¢â€¢ ;  62].  Bonafide of newly discovered non-coding mutations in the TERT promoter was established by the detection in cancers other than melanoma [ 63â€¢â€¢]. The frequency of the mutations seems to vary between cancer types (Table 1). The highest frequencies of the TERT promoter mutations have so far been reported	 besides melanoma	 in pleomorphic dermal sarcoma	 myxoid liposarcoma	 glioma	 urothelial cell carcinoma of bladder	 basal and squamous cell carcinoma of skin	 liver cancer and others [ 63â€¢â€¢; 64; 65; 66; 67; 68; 69; 70; 71; 72; 73; 74; 75 ;  76]. The mutations occur in other cancer types as well	 albeit	 at low frequencies [ 63â€¢â€¢ ;  67]. Based on the prevalence in different cancer types it has been hypothesized that the TERT promoter mutations mainly occur in tumors that are derived from tissues with low rates of self-renewal [ 63â€¢â€¢ ;  77]. Unlike melanoma and other skin related malignancies	" no tumor from the cancers affecting internal organs carried CC > TT tandem mutations in the TERT promoter with the exception of that at the positions âˆ’138/âˆ’139 bp from ATG start site in bladder cancer. The tandem mutation reported so far in 4 of the 1231 bladder tumors could also be generated by a single-base mutation at âˆ’138 bp as the base change at âˆ’139 bp has been reported as a rare polymorphism represented by rs35550267 [ 56â€¢â€¢; 65 ;  66]. The differences in mutational pattern in cancer types are known to reflect etiological divergences and the C > T base change in tumors can also be attributed to APOBEC cytidine deaminase expression in cancer development [ 78â€¢â€¢ ;  79â€¢â€¢].

Table options Functional aspects of TERT promoter mutations The high recurrence	 specificity and gain of function support that the non-coding TERT promoter mutations are driver rather than passenger events in cancer development. The functional relevance of the mutations was indicated by the basic reporter assays that showed 2â€“4-fold increased promoter activity [ 56â€¢â€¢; 57â€¢â€¢ ;  80â€¢â€¢]. Tumors from thyroid cancers	 primary glioma	 malignant pleural mesothelioma and liver cancers with TERT promoter mutations were associated with higher gene expression than those without mutations [ 67; 69; 72 ;  74]. Though limited at the moment	 the available data do indicate a tendency of the TERT promoter mutations being present in specific clinical and phenotypic subtypes and appear to be associated with adversarial forms of the disease. While in medulloblastomas the TERT promoter mutations were inversely associated with increased OTX2 expression; in primary adult glioma	 the mutations occurred mainly in conjunction with EGFR amplification [ 69]. Glioma patients with TERT promoter mutations showed an association with poorer survival than patients without mutations; in thyroid cancer	 mutations are reportedly more frequent in advanced thyroid cancers than in papillary thyroid cancers [ 63â€¢â€¢; 70 ;  71].  The studies on bladder cancer consistently showed that TERT promoter mutations are the most frequent lesions with even distribution across all stages and grades [ 65; 66 ;  80â€¢â€¢]. Intriguingly	 an observed interaction has raised a possibility of eventual use of the TERT promoter mutations in conjunction with a common polymorphism within the sequence as biomarkers in bladder cancer. The data from bladder cancer showed that the variant allele of a common polymorphism at âˆ’245 bp from ATG start site in the TERT promoter acts as a modifier of the effect of TERT promoter mutations on patient survival and disease recurrence [ 80â€¢â€¢]. Bladder cancer patients with TERT promoter mutations in tumors showed almost two-fold decreased survival and increased disease recurrence in the absence but not in the presence of the variant allele for the rs2853669 polymorphism [ 80â€¢â€¢]. Mechanistic support for the observation was provided by the fact that mutations result in de novo creation of Ets/TCF binding motifs; the variant allele of the rs2853669 polymorphism	 on the contrary	 disrupts a preexisting non-canonical Ets2 binding site in the proximal region of the TERT promoter	 adjacent to an E-box [ 44].  The occurrence of highly specific TERT promoter mutations indicates a strong selection pressure for the gene over-expression on path to cellular transformation. Increased telomerase production has been demonstrated to promote cancer progression in an animal model [ 81â€¢]. The effect of the promoter mutations on TERT expression can be tenable only in the presence of Ets/TCF transcription factors that can specifically bind to the de novo sites created by the mutations. Some of the Ets/TCF transcription factors are downstream targets of MAPK pathway	 where BRAF is a prominent intermediate [ 82; 83 ;  84]. Whether in melanoma activated BRAF is a driving force in selection of TERT promoter mutations remains to be determined. Nevertheless	 expression of Ets transcription factors is ubiquitous in melanoma and other cancers [ 85 ;  86].  Many studies have stressed the function of the TERT gene beyond its role in maintenance of the telomere; therefore the mutations in the TERT promoter can affect non-canonical processes associated with TERT [ 87; 88; 89; 90 ;  91]. TERT acts as a modulator of Wnt-b-catenin signaling pathway and induces stem cell characteristics in glioma; TERT also regulates expression of NF-kB	 a master regulator of inflammation [ 92â€¢; 93 ;  94]. TERT was shown to be important for proliferation of p53-negative cells through ATR mediated stabilization of ETV1	 which binds downstream of the transcriptional start site [95]. Other non-canonical functions of TERT include enhanced cell proliferation	 decreased apoptosis	 regulation of DNA damage responses	 chromatin state and increased cellular proliferation life span [ 96; 97 ;  98]. The effect of the mutations beyond transcription also remains a probability. The human TERT promoter contains G-rich sequence and has potential for G-quadruplex formation that can potentially be targeted to regulate gene transcription [ 99]. G-quadruplexes have been also implicated in inhibition of telomerase and control of gene expression [100].  Conceptual advancement and therapeutic possibilities The TERT promoter mutations are thought to represent a conceptual advancement in the sense that those instead of altering an encoded protein modulate transcriptional regulation and represent first evidence of driver alterations in so called â€˜dark matterâ€™ of the human genome [ 101â€¢ ;  102]. A host of germline variants discovered through genome wide association studies contribute to the susceptibility of various diseases through transcriptional deregulation [103]. While TERT promoter mutations represent novel findings in human cancer	 alterations in components associated with telomerase assembly	 telomere protection or telomere recruitment are known to impact stem cell function and lifespan in mammals through various disorders [ 104 ;  105].  Several strategies of therapeutic telomerase inhibition including small molecular inhibitors	 immunotherapy	 gene therapy	 telomere and telomerase-proteins in different cancers have entered clinical trial [106]. It will be interesting to see if the TERT promoter mutations	 that increase gene expression	 influence the current on-going research on targeted therapeutics or if the use of telomerase inhibitors in conjunction with kinase inhibitors like vemurafenib or similar small molecules in melanoma can alleviate recurrent resistance [ 107]. Abstract Cell immortalization has been considered for a long time as a classic hallmark of cancer cells. Besides telomerase reactivation	 such immortalization could be due to telomere maintenance through the â€œalternative mechanism of telomere lengtheningâ€ (ALT) but the mechanisms underlying both forms of reactivation remained elusive. Mutations in the coding region of telomerase gene are very rare in the cancer setting	 despite being associated with some degenerative diseases. Recently	 mutations in telomerase (TERT) gene promoter were found in sporadic and familial melanoma and subsequently in several cancer models	 notably in gliomas	 thyroid cancer and bladder cancer. The importance of these findings has been reinforced by the association of TERT mutations in some cancer types with tumour aggressiveness and patient survival. In the first part of this review	 we summarize the data on the biology of telomeres and telomerase	 available methodological approaches and non-neoplastic diseases associatedwith telomere dysfunction. In the second part	 we review the information on telomerase expression and genetic alterations in the most relevant types of cancer (skin	 thyroid	 bladder and central nervous system) on record	 and discuss the value of telomerase as a new biomarker with impact on the prognosis and survival of the patients and as a putative therapeutic target. Keywords Telomerase . TERT . Promoter . Mutations . Biomarker . Cancer Telomeres and telomerase in germinative and somatic tissues Normal somatic cells are not immortal and dispose of a predetermined limited number of divisions	 a phenomenon known as the Hayflick limit. In 1961	 Leonard Hayflick demonstrated that in cell cultures	 a population of normal human fetal cells could divide around 40 to 60 times before entering into senescence [44]. At the time	 the limited replication potential of somatic cells was not fully understood. Years later	 the pioneering research of Nobel Prize winners Elizabeth Blackburn	 Jack Szostak and Carolyn Greider identified a refined mechanism by which telomeres are shortened at each round of cell division creating a replication limit [9	36	 116]. Currently	 it is well established that telomeres are JoÃ£o Vinagre	 Vasco Pinto and Ricardo Celestino contributed equally to the manuscript. J. Vinagre : V. Pinto : R. Celestino : M. Reis : H.

The main function of telomeres is to preserve chromosome integrity and genome stability by preventing the chromosome end from degradation [41	 85]. At each cell division	 the telomeric DNA is diminished and telomeres become progressively shorter. Eventually	 this loss leads to a stop in cell division that forces cell senescence or cell death. This telomere-based mechanismhas been proposed to serve as the â€œclockâ€ that controls the number of times each cell can divide [41	 85]. In order to achieve immortalization	 cells need to overcome the aforementioned barrier. There are two major pathways cells use for maintain telomere lengthening; they either reactivate telomerase	 a ribonucleoprotein polymerase	 which elongates telomeres by adding hexameric 5â€²-TTAGGG-3â€² tandem repeats to the chromosomal ends at the ends	 or take advantage of a non-telomerase-dependent (alternative) mechanism	 known as ALT [21	 59]. Reactivation of telomerase is present in up to 90 % of human cancers	 and it allows proliferative cancer cells to maintain telomere length [65]. The remaining 10 to 15 % of human cancers do not have detectable telomerase activity	 and a subset of such cases maintain telomere length relying on the ALT mechanism [21]. Heaphy and colleagues performed a comprehensive survey on ALT phenotype in 6	110 primary tumours from 94 different cancer subtypes and observed the presence of ALT in 3.7 % of all tumour specimens but its absence in all benign neoplasms and normal tissues [46]. In this study	 the ALT phenotype was identified for the first time in medulloblastoma	 oligodendroglioma	 schwannoma and glioblastoma [46]. Later on	 Heaphy and colleagues demonstrated that ATRX or DAXX mutations are closely associated with the development of ALT in pancreatic endocrine tumours whereas ATRX mutations lead to ALT phenotype in cancers of the central nervous system [45]. Benign neoplasms and normal somatic cells apparently lack telomerase activity but a high level of telomerase activity can be detected in germ cells and in stem cells of selfrenewing tissues [41]. Some putative stem cells	 such as the main cells of thyroid solid cell nests	 also express telomerase	 as we have previously reported [95	 101]. Most cells that need that to escape telomere shortening rely on the reactivation of telomerase. The telomerase complex comprises several components	 the most important being the telomerase RNA component (TERC)	 the telomerase reverse transcriptase catalytic subunit (TERT) and dyskerin (DKC1 gene) [22	83	 87]. It was shown in telomerase-negative cells	 such as differentiated epithelial cells or human fibroblasts [33]	 that TERT is the only component necessary to restore the activity of the telomerase complex. The TERT gene is located on chromosome 5 and includes 16 exons that span a 35-kb region. The core promoter of telomerase includes 330 base pairs upstream of the start site	 is located in a GC-rich region and contains transcript sites/consensus for transcription elements	 indicating a high level of regulation by multiple factors [23] at transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional level [22]. Methods to evaluate telomeres length and telomerase activity As mentioned above	 telomere length is maintained and higher levels of telomerase activity can be detected in cancer cells than in normal somatic cells. The interest in the detection of telomerase activity and/or in telomere length measurement has been increasing since it can represent a powerful tool for the diagnosis of telomerase-related diseases as well as for the understanding of cancer etiopathogenesis and	 hopefully	 for improving cancer treatment. In order to evaluate the two aforementioned features	 several methods and approaches to measure telomere length	 telomerase messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and telomerase enzymatic activity have been developed [113]. Herein	 we merely provide a summary of the methods available; for a more detailed review	 the reader is referred to references [46] and [115]. The traditional telomere restriction fragment (TRF) analysis measures the average length of all telomeres present in a cell population and is the most used technique for evaluating telomere length [4]. Based on Southern blotting	 TRF involves the use of restriction enzymes to digest genomic DNA and a hybridization step with a telomeric probe [60]. Additional techniques available include: STELA (single telomere elongation length analysis)	 a very accurate method that can only be used on a sample with a limited number of cells; quantitative PCR	 less time consuming but less accurate [7]; Q-FISH (quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization) which allows specific measurement of chromosome ends with high resolution [20]; and	 finally	 Flow FISH	 a very accurate method that evaluates cells in suspension [5]. The detection of telomerase is mainly based on assays that evaluate telomerase enzymatic activity [64	 129]. Refinement of these techniques led to a sensitive technique	 the telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP). TRAP assay includes the preparation of a protein extract by cell lysis and the addition of a labelled oligonucleotide substrate along with dNTPs	 followed by PCR. In the first step of the reaction	 if telomerase is active in the extract	 it adds a number of telomeric repeats onto the 3â€² end of a labelled substrate oligonucleotide; in the second step	 the extended products are amplified by PCR using primers	 which generates a ladder of products with 6-base increments starting at 50 nucleotides: 50	56	62	68	 etc. [59]. TRAP is the most used technique to evaluate telomerase activity due to its high sensitivity but it also has some limitations: it is very time consuming and can generate false-negative results if the PCR step fails [64]. Recent improvements in the TRAP technique avoid the use 120 Virchows Arch (2014) 465:119â€“133 of radioactive nucleotides [115]; other efforts have been made to refine the protocol in an attempt to still improve its sensitivity and to increase its reliability [113	 129]. Telomerase in degenerative diseases Three human diseasesâ€”dyskeratosis congenita (DC)	 aplastic anaemia (AA) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)â€”are associated to mutations in genes that code for the telomerase components	 either TERC or TERT	 as well for the following telomerase-associated proteins: DKC1	 telomerase Cajal body protein 1	 TCAB1 (WRP53 gene)	 NOLA2 protein (NHP2 gene) and NOP10 protein (NOLA3 gene) [79]. Additionally	 one of the six proteins that compose the shelterin complexâ€” TERF1-interacting nuclear factor 2 (TIN2 gene)â€”has also been associated with autosomal-dominant DC	 Hoyeraal Hreidarsson syndrome	 Revesz syndrome and AA. Furthermore	 some alterations affect proteins which do not have a direct impact on telomerase but concern the telomere such the telomere maintenance complex component 1 protein (CTC1 gene) that is associated to Coats plus syndrome	 which is a formof cerebroretinalmicroangiopathy with calcifications and cysts. Finally	 mutations of the regulator of telomere elongation helicase 1 (RTEL1 gene) have been identified in patients with severe autosomal recessive DC [35] (Table 1). DC is a rare inherited disorder characterized by a typical triad of clinical manifestations: skin hyperpigmentation	 oral leukoplakia and nail dystrophy [26]. The majority of cases (>80 %) occur in children and are diagnosed usually about the age of ten when the children start presenting bone marrow failure together with the previously described clinical triad. Other symptoms that include indicators of premature ageing	 such as pulmonary diseases	 dental abnormalities and alopecia	 are present in 15â€“25 % of the cases [79]. Within the DC spectrum	 there is the Hoyeraal Hreidarsson syndrome	 a multisystemic disorder characterized by mental retardation	 microcephaly	 intrauterine growth retardation	 cerebellar hypoplasia	 immunodeficiency and AA [51]. The Revesz syndrome that is characterized by bilateral exudative retinopathy	 bone-marrow hypoplasia	 nail dystrophy	 fine hair	 cerebellar hypoplasia and growth retardation is also present in the DC disease spectrum [108]. DC is a genetically heterogeneous disease; to date	 there are nine genes associated with DC and all of them contribute to telomere maintenance/protection or telomerase function	 thus explaining the excessively short telomeres of DC patients. The group of DC genes encompasses the core telomerase component TERT and TERC and the telomerase complex proteins coded by DKC1	 WRAP53	 NOP10 and NHP2 genes. Other genes include the shelterin complex TIN2 gene	 CTC1 and RTEL1 genes [35] (Table 1). AA is a rare and severe bone marrow disorder characterized by hypocelullar bone marrow and low blood cell counts [109]. Similarly to DC	 the cases of AA arise from scarcity of haematopoietic progenitor and stem cells [17]. Since patients have shorter telomeres than matched controls	 telomerase components constitute an attractive target for genetic screening. Mutations have been detected in the coding sequence of telomerase core components TERT and TERC (Table 1). Occasionally	 AA can develop slowly and appear as an atypical form of DC due to bone marrow failure over time [31]. IPF is a rapidly progressive disorder with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and different degrees of penetrance. The symptoms that characterize the disease are chronic cough and shortness of breath due to fibrotic lesions and scarring of the lungs [40]. IPF can co-exist in patients with AA and DC [35]. Like in the aforementioned disorders	 IPF patients also have shorter telomeres than age-matched controls [17]. TERT and TERC telomerase component mutations have been found in familial forms of IPF [107].

Most of them are haematological disorders	 such as myelodysplatic syndrome and paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria [35]. In cases of myelodysplastic syndrome	 mutations are considered an extremely rare event and were described in TERC coding region and its promoter [17]. The same mutation	 which ablates a transcription factor binding site in the TERC promoter	 has also been detected in a case of paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria [17]. Additional information regarding mutations in degenerative disorders is summarized in Table 1	 and further information can be retrieved on the telomerase disease database (http://telomerase.asu.edu/). Telomerase promoter mutations and cancer It has been known for 20 years that high levels of telomerase activity can be detected in cancer cells [59]; this contrasts with the fact that mutations affecting the telomerase coding region appear to be very uncommon in cancer [4]. A rare example of neoplasia presenting mutations in the coding region of telomerase is acute myeloid leukaemia in which few TERT mutations have been identified [17]. However	 it should be taken into account that this form of leukaemia can arise from AA and myelodysplatic syndromes in which TERT mutations have been detected [17]. Published simultaneously in the beginning of 2013	 two different studies reported mutations in the promoter of the telomerase gene inmelanoma [50	 53].We and others reported the presence of recurrent somatic mutations in the telomerase promoter in cancers of the central nervous system (43â€“51 %)	 bladder (59â€“66 %)	 hepatocellular carcinoma (59 %)	 thyroid (follicular cell-derived tumours) (10 %)	 skin (melanoma	 29â€“ 73 %) and tumours originated from tissues with relatively low rates of self-renewal [58	75	88	 121]. Additionally	 other studies reported the association of telomerase promoter mutations to other types of tumours	 including atypical fibroxantoma (93 %)	 pleomorphic dermal sarcoma (76 %) [39]	 bladder cancer (65 %) [1	 54]	 basal cell carcinoma (78 %)	 squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (50 %) [110] and clear cell carcinoma of the ovary [124]. In Tables 2 and 3	 we summarize the frequency of TERT promoter mutations in human cancers with a high percentage of mutations and in human cancers with absent or low frequency of TERT promoter mutations	 respectively. The in vitro biological assessment of the functional consequence of these mutations	 studied by promoter luciferase assay	 revealed that their presence results in a two to fourfold increase in telomerase expression [50	 53]. Since previously published studies reported high levels of TERT expression in the set of tumours with TERT promoter mutations [70	78	 111]	 it is likely that such alterations may represent one of the missing links between telomerase gene regulation/ reactivation. Telomerase promoter mutations in skin cancers Telomerase activity has been reported in normal skin by some authors [43	118	 119] while other authors suggest that in normal skin	 it is a rare event [52	 91]. Its activation in the epidermis may be related with the need for cell proliferation and damage repair [11]. The shortening of telomeres	 on the other hand	 is believed to provide a barrier for epidermal cell proliferation (i.e. cancer) [11]. Telomerase activity has been reported in cutaneous melanomas	 using the TRAP assay	 with increasing values from normal skin to benign nevi and to dysplastic nevi and finally to melanoma [29]. An association between increased telomerase activity and worse prognostic features	 namely	 ulceration	 vascular invasion	 mitotic rate and Breslow thickness has been described in melanoma [18	32	81	91	 100]. Furthermore	 higher telomerase activity has also been associated with higher proliferation rate and early metastasis [100	 104]. The suppression of telomerase activity in melanoma cell lines induced cellular differentiation and reduced the metastatic ability [6	 30]. Longer telomere length has been linked with a higher number of nevi per patient and an increased risk for cutaneous melanoma development [2	8	42	 86]. It was proposed that shorter telomere length in nevi limits proliferation and promotes senescence	 protecting against malignant transformation [41	 86]. At variance with the aforementioned reports	 Burke and colleagues suggested that telomere length can also be influenced by CDKN2A mutational status (a high-risk melanoma susceptibility gene)	 sun exposure and pigmentation phenotype and therefore cannot be considered a biomarker to predict melanoma risk per se [12]. Two seminal papers reported high frequency of TERT promoter mutations in familial and sporadic melanoma [50	 53]. In the study from Horn and colleagues	 a melanomaprone family was investigated through linkage and NGS and a germ-line disease-segregating mutation was identified in the telomerase promoter [50]. Further confirmation was obtained from the same group in a series of cell lines derived from metastatic melanomas	 respective metastases and matched primary melanomas that revealed a higher frequency of the mutations in the metastases (74	 85 and 33 %	 respectively) [50]. Huang and colleagues took a different approach	 data mining of whole genome sequencing data	 publicly available. They detected the presence of promoter mutations in 89 % of melanoma cases [53]. The mutations clustered mostly	 but not exclusively	 in two hotspots that are located at âˆ’146 and 122 Virchows Arch (2014) 465:119â€“133 âˆ’124 bps distance upstream of the start site ATG [53]. The detected mutations were cytidine to thymidine transitions at a dipyrimidine motif indicating a putative ultraviolet lightinduced damage signature.

Moreover	 it was demonstrated in vitro by luciferase assay that the presence of these mutations lead to a two to fourfold increase of the TERT promoter activity [54]. TERT promoter mutations were not detected in nevi [121] but in 13%of mucosalmelanomas [27]. In primary cutaneous melanomas	 TERT promoter mutations were found to be associated with BRAF V600E mutations	 worse prognostic features and shorter disease free and overall survival [94	 121]. In ocular melanomas	 TERT promoter mutations were described in 0 to 32 % of conjunctival melanomas [25	 121]. Mutations were not detected in uveal melanomas [121]. At variance with the aforementioned data	 Dono and colleagues observed a case of uveal melanoma harbouring a TERT promoter mutation that co-existed with GNA11 and EIF1AX mutations [25]. TERT promoter mutations are frequent in non-melanoma skin cancer	 ranging from 39 to 74 % in sporadic basal cell carcinomas (BCC) [37	94	 110] and present in up to 50 % of cases of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) [37	 110].Telomerase activity has been detected in BCC using TRAP assay both in tumour and tumour-free margins	 varying between 20 and 100 %	 with less activity in the latter [29]. In the tumour-free margins	 telomerase activity was found to be more prevalent in sun-exposed skin [105	 119]. In SCC	 the data are scarce: Ueda and colleagues found telomerase activity in 100%of the cases of a small series (n=8) [119]. Few studies have examined the association between telomere length and skin cancer [2]. Some studies found no significant association between telomere length in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) and risk of non-melanoma skin cancer	 either in BCC (two independent sets) [68] or in SCC [42	 68]. In contrast	 other authors found that longer telomeres in PBL are protective for BCC [2	 86] and SCC [2]. Telomere length has also been evaluated by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) showing that higher telomere length in BCC is significantly higher than in SCC [93]. Telomerase promoter mutations in thyroid carcinomas Thyroid tissue is a conditionally renewing tissue that proliferates rarely in adult life. In line with this	 telomerase activity in normal thyroid samples is almost absent	 being detected in less than 7%of cases [16	 114]. On the other hand	 telomerase activity was consistently reported in a specific population of thyroid cellsâ€”the solid cell nests (SCNs) which are considered to represent embryonic remnants of the ultimobranchial body [95	 101]. Thyroid carcinomas apparently display less frequent telomerase activation than most human carcinomas. Awide range of frequencies have been reported [16]; in average	 it seems that two thirds of thyroid carcinomas display telomerase activation that is more frequent in the undifferentiated (anaplastic) than in differentiated carcinomas [16]. When the results obtained by several authors are combined	 telomerase activity occurs in 48 % of papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) and 71 % of follicular thyroid carcinomas (FTC). A TERT copy number gain was described in familial PTC [14]	 but this finding was not confirmed in another series [55]. A recent study by Capezzone and colleagues reported telomerase activity in most sporadic and familialmalignant thyroid tumours as well as in some adenomas [15]. Telomerase activity was not observed in hyperplastic nodules or in normal thyroid tissue from patients with sporadic PTC [15]. In summary	 the aforementioned findings suggest that telomerase activity may be associated with a more aggressive clinical behaviour of thyroid tumours. Recently	 somatic mutations in the promoter region of TERT were reported in thyroid tumours [66	74	75	 121]. In a large series of 469 follicular cell-derived thyroid carcinomas Table 3 (continued) Cancer type Number of mutations (%) Range (%) References Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (n=10) 0 â€“ [62] Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (n=8) 0 â€“ [58] Epithelioid sarcoma (n=4) 0 â€“ [62] Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (n=11) 0 â€“ [58	 62] Leiomyosarcoma (n=30) 0 â€“ [58	 62] Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (n=18) 0 â€“ [58	 62] Mesothelioma (n=4) 0 â€“ [58] Myxofibrosarcoma (n=27) 0 â€“ [62] Osteosarcoma (n=23) 1 (4.3) â€“ [58] Pleomorphic liposarcoma (n=15) 0 â€“ [62] Synovial sarcoma (n=41) 1(2.4) (0â€“4.0) [58	 62] Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (n=50) 0 â€“ [58	 62] Well-differentiated liposarcoma (n=10) 0 â€“ [58] Virchows Arch (2014) 465:119â€“133 125 (FCDTC)	 TERT promoter mutations were found in 7.5 % of PTC	 17.1 % of FTC	 29.0 % of poorly differentiated thyroid carcinomas (PDTC) and 33.0 % of anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (ATC) [80]. This stepwise increase in the frequency of TERT promoter mutations from well to poorly differentiated and undifferentiated carcinomas was also reported in other studies [66	 74] (Table 2). TERT promoter mutations were not detected in normal thyroid tissue	 benign lesions or medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). Moreover	 very few tumours with oncocytic features harbouring TERT promoter mutations have been reported	 and no mutations were detected in a small series of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma nor in tumours from individuals exposed to the Chernobyl accident [58	77	 121]. The majority (about 80 %) of mutated cases presented the âˆ’124G>A mutation. In PTC	 TERT promoter mutations were significantly more frequent in BRAF-mutated tumours than in BRAF wild-type tumours [74	75	80	 121]. The TERT promoter mutations were associated with increased mRNA expression	 and this increase was particularly pronounced in tumours harbouring both BRAF and TERT promoter mutations [121]. Two studies analysed the relationship between TERT promoter mutations	 clinico-pathological features and outcome. TERT promoter mutations were significantly associated with older age at diagnosis [74	 80]	 larger tumour size and higher stage [80]. TERT promoter mutations were also found to be an independent predictor of distant metastases and disease persistence at the end of follow-up in differentiated thyroid carcinomas (DTC) [80]. Patients with TERT promoter-mutated tumours were submitted to more radioiodine treatments with higher doses as well as to other treatment modalities including surgery	 external beam irradiation and/or treatment with tyrosine-kinase inhibitors [80]. TERT promoter mutations were significantly associated with disease-specific mortality in the whole FCDTC group; this association held true if the subgroups of patients with DTC	 PTC or FTC were independently considered [80]. In DTC	 the prognostic value of TERT promoter mutations for disease-specific mortality was independent of age and gender [80]. Altogether	 the aforementioned findings indicate that TERT promoter mutations are a major indicator of poor outcome in DTC. The two studies on record onMTC [59	 123] did not reveal TERT promoter mutations in this subtype of thyroid carcinoma. Telomerase promoter mutations in bladder carcinomas The putative role of telomerase in bladder carcinoma (BC) has been a matter of interest in the last two decades. Using TRAP assay	 telomerase activity has been evaluated in BC; telomerase activity was detected in the majority of the studied tumours in contrast to the absence of activity in the respective normal counterpart samples [70	 90]. In some series	 telomerase activity was associated with lower grade and lower stage BC [84	 90]. Other studies pointed out that both telomerase activity [70] and telomerase expression [126] are associated with higher stage and higher grade [70	 90]. Preliminary evidence obtained in cell lines suggest that BC might have TERT promoter mutations [53]. These early results motivated us and others to search for similar events in bladder tumour samples. Similar to cell lines	 the same TERT promoter mutations were detected frequently in BC	 with a prevalence ranging from 47 to 85 % (Table 2) [1	54	61	77	99	121	 125]. These results rank TERT promoter mutations as one of the most frequent genomic events	 possibly the most frequent	 in BC [1	54	61	77	99	121	 125]. TERT mutations were significantly more frequent among FGFR3 mutant tumours [1]. Wu and colleagues reported a significant co-occurrence of TERT promoter mutations and TP53/RB1 inactivating somatic mutations [125] indicating that both mutations may cooperatively contribute to the progression of BC [125]. Conflicting results have been reported on the association between TERT promoter mutations and clinical stage and/or grade of bladder tumours. Wu and colleagues found that TERT promoter mutations are more prevalent in muscle invasive (MI) than in non-muscle invasive (NMI) tumours and also more prevalent in BC patients with advanced tumour stages (T2â€“4) than in those with low stage tumours (Ta or T1) [125]. At variance with this	 another report found no association between mutation status and stage or grade of BC [54]. Similar results were reported by Allory and colleagues who did not find any differences betweenNMI and MI BC in two independent sets of tumours [1]. Similarly to stage and grade	 diverging results were obtained on the association between TERT promoter mutation and prognosis. One group reported that the survival rate of patients with TERT mutations was significantly lower than that of patients without mutations [125]	 whereas another group found no association between clinical outcome and mutation status [1]. An interesting observation was reported by Rachakonda and colleagues who proposed that a common polymorphism	 rs2853669 within a pre-existing Ets2 binding site in the TERT promoter	 acts as a modifier of the effect of the mutations on survival and tumour recurrence [99]. The patients with the mutation presented poorer survival in the absence than in the presence of the polymorphism. The mutation in the absence of the variant allele was highly associated with disease recurrence in patients with Tis	 Ta and T1 tumours [99]. These results may help to explain some of the divergence reported in studies relating TERT promoter mutations and prognosis of patients with BC. As it was previously noticed	 several observations support a model in which TERT somatic mutations are an early event in urothelial carcinogenesis	 including their occurrence in a small fraction of subjects with precursor lesions	 their presence in tumours of both papillary and invasive features and 126 Virchows Arch (2014) 465:119â€“133 their low level of intraindividual heterogeneity when analysing multiple tumour regions [1	 58]. TERT promoter mutations may potentially be used as urinary biomarker; several studies have already performed preliminary evaluations of the feasibility	 sensibility and specificity of such procedure [1	 54]. Prospective studies based upon series are necessary to further assess the clinical utility of the detection of TERT promoter mutations in urine. Telomerase promoter mutations in central nervous system tumours Central nervous system (CNS) often have TERT promoter mutations competing favourably in this aspect with most other types of human cancer [58	 121]. Among CNS tumours	 gliomas are those displaying by far the highest frequency of TERT mutations which can also be detected at lower frequencies in medulloblastoma and meningioma [63]. Within gliomas	 the percentage of cases with TERT promoter mutations differs according to the histopathological type of tumour. TERT promoter mutations are detected in the majority of cases of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) [World Health Organization (WHO) Grade IV] which is the most frequent and aggressive form of glioma and in oligodendrogliomas (WHO Grade II and III)	 in contrast to astrocytoma (WHO Grades I	 II and III) and ependymoma (WHO Grades I	 II and III)	 in which only a small percentage of the tumours harbour such mutations (Table 3) [63	 121]. Furthermore	 the percentage of TERT promoter mutations in oligoastrocytomas	 gliomas with a mixed origin	 is intermediate between that of oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas [58]. These findings fit with the reported data on telomerase activity in gliomas which is considerably higher in GBM(50â€“ 89 %) and oligodendrogliomas (75â€“100 %)	 than in astrocytomas (0â€“45 %) [49	67	 106]. The low frequency of TERT promoter mutations and telomerase activity in grades II and III astrocytomas can be explained by the high prevalence of ATRX mutations	 one of the most frequent mutations in this type of glioma [56]. It is known that ATRX mutations trigger ALT in astrocytoma cells and it has been shown that this alternative mechanism is frequently activated in astrocytomas	 allowing telomere maintenance without the need for telomerase reactivation [48]. In line with this	 the frequency of TERT promoter mutations in secondary GBMs (that arise from the progression of lower grade astrocytomas) is considerably lower than in primary GBMs (that appear de novo) [89]. TERT promoter mutations are rare in paediatric tumours of the CNS [63]. In medulloblastomas that typically develop in children	 TERT promoter mutations are mainly detected in tumours of the group of older patients and are associated with sonic hedgehog and WNT mutations [102]. Upregulation of TERT expression in paediatric brain tumours was associated with hypermethylation of the TERT promoter	 rather than with TERT promoter mutations [19]. These findings are consistent with the fact that the cells	 from which paediatric CNS tumours are thought to originate	 still have activated telomerase which obviates the need for activation of TERT through promoter mutation. Although ATRX and TERT promoter mutations provide an explanation for themaintenance of telomere length in most gliomas	 TERT upregulation was also reported to occur in a subset of gliomas without TERT promoter mutations or ATRX mutations through an as yet unidentified mechanism [58]. Finally	 it is worth noting that	 previous to the discovery of TERT promoter mutations in gliomas	 some studies had reported an association between SNPs in the TERT gene and an increased risk of glioma development [112	 127]. Telomerase promoter mutations in other tumour types In Tables 2 and 3	 we have summarized the data on record on the frequency of TERT promoter mutations in tumours from almost every site. For the sake of simplicity	 we divided the tumours into those with a high frequency of mutations (>5 %	 Table 2) and tumours with no mutations or with a very low frequency of TERT promoter mutations (<5 %	 Table 3). Besides the tumour histotypes with high frequency of TERT promoter mutations described in the previous sections	 there are others in which such mutations appear to be particularly prevalent: hepatocellular carcinoma (56 %)	 several soft tissue tumours histotypes (e.g. 93 % in atypical fibroxanthoma	 79 % in myxoid liposarcoma and 76 % in pleomorphic dermal sarcoma) and carcinoma of the renal pelvis (64 %) (Table 2). Tumour histotypes with intermediate frequencies of TERT promoter mutations include laryngeal carcinoma (27 %) and clear cell carcinoma of the ovary (16 %) (Table 2). The latter value contrasts with the absence or very low frequency of mutations in other ovarian carcinomas (absent in endometrioid carcinoma and in high-grade serous carcinoma) (Table 3) [124]. In clear cell carcinoma of the ovary	 TERT promoter mutations tend to be mutually exclusive with the loss of protein expression of ARID1A	 a tumour suppressor	 and with PI3KCA mutation [124]. Since the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway is involved in the activation of telomerase through phosphorylation	 Wu and colleagues advanced that PI3KCA-activating mutations confer a growth advantage on cancer cells by overcoming replicative senescence [124]. At variance with other tumour models (gliomas	 melanomas	 follicular cell derived carcinoma and others)	 no associations with disease specific survival were observed for ovarian clear cell carcinoma [124]. There are also differences regarding the putative (early or late) timing of the occurrence of TERT promoter mutations in the oncogenic processes of the various tumour models. TERT promoter mutations seem to be present in two settings. As Virchows Arch (2014) 465:119â€“133 127 described by Killela and colleagues	 TERT promoter mutations can be relevant in tissues with relatively low rates of selfrenewal [58]	 an association that fits with the findings in follicular cell-derived thyroid cancer and gliomas. In these two settings (thyroid cancer and gliomas)	 TERT promoter mutations are associated with a guarded prognosis of the patients harbouring the tumours and probably represent late events of the oncogenic process. On the other hand	 TERT promoter mutations can also result from environmental factors such as ultraviolet radiation and chemical carcinogens as suggested by their high frequency in melanoma	 basal cell carcinoma and bladder and tongue carcinomas. In this second setting	 TERT promoter mutations appear to be an early tumorigenic event and do not carry major prognostic value	 with the exception of melanoma. Why clear cut differences exist in the frequency of TERT promoter mutations in tumours of the same system (e.g. hepatocellular carcinoma versus pancreatic carcinoma) remains to be clarified	 although there is enough evidence to claim that the high or low prevalence of the mutations appears to be histotype- rather than site-associated. For instance	 the high frequency in transitional carcinoma of the bladder and renal pelvis is in contrast to low frequency/absence in kidney carcinoma and the extremely low frequency/absence in adenocarcinomas of every organ of the gastrointestinal tract (Tables 2 and 3). Telomerase as a therapeutic target Several therapy strategies have been suggested to control TERT expression in tumours	 mainly using small molecule inhibitors	 gene therapy approaches and immunotherapy (reviewed in [82]). Inhibition of enzymatic activity with small synthetic molecules allows the disruption of the replicative capacity of cancer cells; in this way	 it is though that normal somatic cells will not be affected due to the absence of TERT activity. In vitro studies showed that BIBR1532	 a noncompetitive inhibitor of both TERT and TERC [92]	 leads to cellular senescence reducing proliferation and telomere length [24] and is cytotoxic in high doses [28]. Additionally	 a marked reduction of the tumorigenic potential of tumour cells treated with BIBR1532 was observed in a mouse xenograft model [24]	 with no adverse side effects and uncomplicated oral administration of the drug. BIBR1532 is one of the most promising TERT specific-inhibitors to date. Other small synthetic moleculesâ€”G-quadruplex ligands	 such as BRACO19	 RHSP4 and telomestatinâ€”are promising drugs that can be used for TERT targeting therapies [103]. However	 clinical testing of some of these molecules has been hampered due to the toxic characteristics of the compounds [82]. Cancer cells with TERT activity can be directly targeted by introducing suicide genes or oncolytic viruses driven by the TERT or TERC promoters	 or the inhibition of TERT or TERC activity targeting their RNAs. In the latter strategy	 antisense oligonucleotides	 small interfering RNAs and ribozymes can be applied for inhibition of TERT activity. GRN163L (also known as imetelstat) is the most studied antisense oligonucleotide that causes TERT inhibition and telomere shortening in cancer cell lines derived from different organs [13]. This compound leads to apoptosis of cells and to inhibition of tumour growth	 and it is being used in clinical trials of several cancer types [13]. DNA vaccines (immunotherapy) have been used to generate protective immunity against tumours in several models [96]. The presence of TERT activity in many human cancers turns TERT a tumour-associated antigen suitable for cancer immunotherapy. Contrary to other target antigens	 as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and melanoma-associated antigen	 TERT-based immunotherapy may be applied to a wide range of malignancies due to the highly frequent TERT-altered expression [122]. In vitro and in vivo studies showed tumour regression using TERT-based vaccination approaches (reviewed in [72]). Different peptides have been used to induce anti-TERT immune response [13] and vaccination using the I540â€“548 peptide showed anti-tumour responses in cancer [122]. Several preclinical studies using TERT peptides are being conducted (reviewed in [103]). GV-1001	 GRNVAC 1 and Vx-001 are the most promising vaccines available to date. Future perspectives The implication of telomerase in human diseases has been studied for a long time and firmly established in a few models of degenerative diseases. In cancer	 telomerase dysfunction has been perceived as a potential mechanism for carcinogenesis although the underlying mechanisms remained elusive. The recent identification of telomerase promoter mutations in several types of neoplasia fostered the respective research	 and in less than a year	 numerous studies have been published reporting similar alterations in many cancer models (Tables 2 and 3). In several relevant cancer types	 telomerase promoter mutations seem to constitute a new biomarker for prognosis with potential applications in pre-surgical diagnosis and in the follow-up of the patients. Low-grade bladder cancers represent a good example on how such finding can represent an added value from a clinical standpoint. Up to 70 % of lowgrade non-invasive bladder tumours recur	 and long-term cystoscopic surveillance is the current standard of care. This procedure is expensive and time consuming and carries significant morbidity. The non-invasive evaluation of telomerase promoter mutations in urine may provide diagnostic 128 Virchows Arch (2014) 465:119â€“133 information	 independent of routine cytology	 and most importantly	 may identify low-grade tumours	 which are difficult to identify by cytological examination alone. Whenever dealing with a recurrence	 a non-invasive diagnostic test that also serves as a surveillance method will probably represent an attractive alternative for patients	 taking into consideration the limitations of the technique. A preliminary evaluation of the diagnostic usefulness of the detection of TERT promoter mutations was already performed in urine samples	 and the results indicate that such detection may serve as a biomarker of early disease and recurrence [1	 54]. Moving to a trendier subject	 it seems extremely interesting to evaluate whether or not TERT promoter mutations can be detected in tumour-circulating DNA from cell-free fragments in body fluids. In the affirmative case	 this process may represent a major advance in the follow-up of cancer patients. Despite the large amount of information collected in these recent years	 more questions than answers remain at present with regard to the role of telomerase involvement in carcinogenesis. A novel mechanism for telomerase re-activation and/ or re-expression was discovered; this mechanism	 together with ALT	 represents the two major pathways for telomere length maintenance. Besides them	 other mechanisms may modulate telomerase expression	 such as novel forms of transcriptional regulation or epigenetic alterations. We think it is the appropriate time to study large series with robust clinicopathological data and to search for correlations that may establish or rule out the prognostic value of TERT promoter mutations in the various types of human cancer. Last but not least	 cell and molecular biology studies are mandatory to understand the role(s) of telomerase in cancer cells that appear to go beyond the increased replicative potential (immortalization) and have impact also in metastatic capacities.  Malignant cells	 like all actively growing cells	 must maintain their telomeres	 but genetic mechanisms responsible for telomere maintenance in tumors have only recently been discovered. In particular	 mutations of the telomere binding proteins alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) or death-domain associated protein (DAXX) have been shown to underlie a telomere maintenance mechanism not involving telomerase (alternative lengthening of telomeres)	 and point mutations in the promoter of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene increase telomerase expression and have been shown to occur in melanomas and a small number of other tumors. To further define the tumor types in which this latter mechanism plays a role	 we surveyed 1	230 tumors of 60 different types. We found that tumors could be divided into types with low (<15%) and high (â‰¥15%) frequencies of TERT promoter mutations. The nine TERT-high tumor types almost always originated in tissues with relatively low rates of self renewal	 including melanomas	 liposarcomas	 hepatocellular carcinomas	 urothelial carcinomas	 squamous cell carcinomas of the tongue	 medulloblastomas	 and subtypes of gliomas (including 83% of primary glioblastoma	 the most common brain tumor type). TERT and ATRX mutations were mutually exclusive	 suggesting that these two genetic mechanisms confer equivalent selective growth advantages. In addition to their implications for understanding the relationship between telomeres and tumorigenesis	 TERT mutations provide a biomarker that may be useful for the early detection of urinary tract and liver tumors and aid in the classification and prognostication of brain tumors.  Telomeres are nucleoprotein complexes at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes that are required for chromosomal integrity. Several hundred nucleotides of telomere repeats cap each chromosomal end	 and in the absence of telomerase activity	 telomeres shorten with each cell division (1). Eventually	 uncapped telomeres trigger cell death or senescence. Cancer cells seem to divide ad infinitum and therefore	 require some telomere maintenance mechanism to avoid this fate. Because telomerase activity is generally higher in cancer cells than normal cells	 it was originally believed that telomerase was somehow activated in cancer cells (2â€“6). However	 it was subsequently realized that telomerase was only inactive in terminally differentiated cells and that normal stem cells in self-renewing tissues retained telomerase activity (1	 7â€“9). Because normal stem cells must replicate throughout the long lifetimes of mammals (which can be more than a century in humans)	 it is clear that such cells must also retain telomerase activity. Because normal stem cells are thought to be the progenitors of cancers	 there would be no need to specifically activate telomerase in cancer cells; the enzyme was already active in the precursors	 just as were the hundreds of other enzymes and proteins normally required for cell proliferation.  This view was challenged by the discovery of another mechanism for maintaining telomere length [i.e.	 alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT)] (10â€“12). ALT occurs in the absence of telomerase activity and seems to be dependent on homologous recombination. It occurs in a particularly high fraction of certain tumor types	 such as sarcomas	 pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors	 and brain tumors	 but rarely in most common tumor types	 such as those tumor types of the colon	 breast	 lung	 prostate	 or pancreas (13). Why would cancer cells need ALT if telomerase activity was already constitutively active in their precursors? This question was highlighted by the discovery that many ALT cancers harbor mutations in alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) or death-domain associated protein (DAXX)	 genes encoding proteins that interact with each other at telomeres (10	 11). Presumably	 the absence of functional ATRX/DAXX complexes permits the homologous recombination resulting in ALT. At minimum	 these data were compatible with the ideas that there could be a selective advantage for genetic alterations that results in telomere maintenance and that telomerase is not indefinitely activated in all normal stem cell precursors of cancers.  Another challenge to the idea that genetic alterations were not required for telomerase activation in cancer was raised by the finding that mutations of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter occurred in âˆ¼70% of melanomas and in a small number of tumor cell lines derived from various tissue types (14	 15). Importantly	 only 5 of 110 cell lines derived from lung	 stomach	 ovary	 uterus	 or prostate cancers harbored TERT promoter mutations	 whereas 19 mutations were found among 37 cell lines derived from various other tumor types. This situation is analogous to the situation for ALT	 which is infrequently observed in common epithelial cancers but is observed more regularly in tumors derived from nonepithelial cells	 particularly sarcomas and brain tumors (13).  These findings prompted us to formulate a hypothesis about the mechanisms responsible for telomerase activity in cancers. We suggest that there are two ways to maintain telomere lengths as cells divide: (i) through epigenetic regulation of telomerase activity	 which occurs in stem cells of tissues that are rapidly renewing	 and (ii) through somatic mutations that maintain telomere lengths	 such as mutations in the TERT promoter or mutations in DAXX or ATRX. Those cancers that originate in tissues that are constantly self-renewing	 such as cancers of the epithelia of the gastrointestinal tract and skin or bone marrow	 would be unlikely to harbor telomere-maintaining mutations	 because telomerase is already epigenetically activated in their precursor cells. In contrast	 tumors arising from cells that are not constantly self-renewing	 such as neurons	 glial cells	 fibroblasts	 hepatocytes	 islet cells	 and pancreatic ductal epithelial cells	 might frequently harbor such mutations. A corollary of this hypothesis is that tumor types exhibiting high frequencies of ALT would also exhibit high frequencies of TERT mutations	 and these mutations would be distributed in a mutually exclusive fashion. To test these hypotheses as well as answer other questions related to the role of TERT promoter mutations in various cancer types	 we determined the prevalence of TERT promoter mutations in a large number of tumors.  Go to: RESULTS We attempted to evaluate at least 20 individual specimens of common tumor types and fewer specimens of rare tumor types	 depending on availability of specimens in our laboratories. In those tumor types in which our pilot studies showed a significant number of mutations	 additional tumors were evaluated. Melanomas and tumors of the lung	 stomach	 and esophagus were excluded	 because they had already been adequately evaluated in the seminal papers cited (14	 15). When primary tumors rather than cell lines were used	 we ensured that the fraction of neoplastic cells was >50% through histopathologic examination of frozen sections of the tissue blocks used for DNA purification. In those cases in which the neoplastic content was <50%	 we microdissected the lesions to enrich the neoplastic content to >50%. Primers were designed to amplify the region containing the two TERT mutations that were previously describedâ€”C228T and C250Tâ€”corresponding to the positions 124 and 146 bp	 respectively	 upstream of the TERT ATG start site (14	 15). The PCR fragments were then purified and analyzed by conventional Sanger sequencing.  In all	 we evaluated TERT promoter mutations in 1	230 tumor specimens and identified 231 mutations (18.8%) (Table 1). C228T and C250T mutations accounted for 77.5% and 20.8% of the alterations	 respectively (Dataset S1). Additionally	 we detected four mutations that had not been observed previously: three C228A mutations and one C229A mutation (Dataset S1). All four of these mutations as well as a representative subset of the C228T and C250T mutations (n = 59) were somatic	 as evidenced by their absence in normal tissues of the patients containing the mutations in their tumors.  Table 1. Table 1. Frequency of TERT promoter mutations The 1	230 tumors represented 60 tumor types. In 26 of these tumor types	 at least 15 individual tumors were evaluated (comprising a total of 1	043 individual tumors) (Fig. 1). In the remaining tumor types	 only a small number of samples (2â€“12) was available	 in part because these tumor types are generally uncommon in Western populations (Table 1). Among the tumor types in which at least 15 individual tumors were available for study	 a clear distinction could be made. Eighteen of these tumor types had only occasional TERT promoter mutations (zero to three mutations	 comprising 0â€“15% of the tumors of each type) (Fig. 1). We classified these tumor types as TERT-low (TERT-L)	 because they had a low frequency of TERT promoter mutations. Eight other tumor types were classified as TERT-high (TERT-H) because of their relatively high prevalence of TERT promoter mutations (16â€“83% of the tumors of each type).  Fig. 1. Fig. 1. Frequency of TERT promoter mutations; 15 or more tumors were analyzed in 26 tumor types. Gliomas are divided into primary GBM	 astrocytoma (including astrocytoma grades II and III	 as well as secondary GBM)	 and oligodendroglioma. The TERT-L tumor types included some of the most prevalent cancers	 including epithelial tumors of the breast	 prostate	 thyroid	 pancreas	 gall bladder	 uterus	 and colon (as well as tumors of the lung	 stomach	 and esophagus based on prior studies) (14	 15) and leukemias. In fact	 no TERT mutations were identified in any specimen of 30 tumor types that we studied	 comprising a total of 546 tumors (Table 1). Some nonepithelial cancers	 such as synovial sarcomas	 chordomas	 neuroblastomas	 osteosarcomas	 and ependymomas	 were also TERT-L.  Eight TERT-H tumor types were identified (in addition to the previously described melanomas) (14	 15). These tumors included tumors of the CNS	 transitional cell carcinomas of the urinary tract	 hepatocellular carcinomas	 myxoid liposarcomas	 and oral cavity carcinomas. Although only a small number of TERT-H tumors (other than melanomas) were examined in previous studies (15)	 mutations in gliomas	 hepatocellular	 and oral cavity carcinomas were detected	 which would be expected on the basis of the high frequency of mutation in these tumors types (Table 1).  Clinical and Molecular Correlations in TERT-H Tumors. Sarcomas. One of the highest frequencies of TERT promoter mutation was found in myxoid liposarcoma (19 of 24 tumors	 79% with mutation). Myxoid liposarcomas account for more than one-third of all liposarcomas and âˆ¼10% of all adult soft tissue sarcomas (16). Patients are relatively young	 with a peak age range between 30 and 50 y. At the genetic level	 the most characteristic change is a t(12;16) (q13;p11) chromosomal translocation that results in the fusion of the FUS and DDIT3 genes (16	 17). The cellular origin of these tumors is unknown	 but preadipocytic progenitor cells and mesenchymal stem cells have been implicated (18); after embryogenesis	 the mitotic activity of these cells is thought to be low. Other sarcomas	 also thought to originate from mesenchymal cells that do not self-renew in the absence of damage	 were not TERT-H (Table 1). These sarcomas included synovial sarcomas (0% of 16 tumors) and osteosarcomas (4.3% of 23 tumors). Of note	 myxoid liposarcomas have been previously shown to have a relatively high prevalence of ALT (24% of 38 tumors) (13	 19). The data	 in aggregate	 are compatible with the idea that myxoid liposarcomas almost always genetically activate telomere maintenance genes through either TERT promoter mutations or ALT.  Hepatocellular carcinomas. Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) are the third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide	 and their incidence is increasing in the United States (20). Most HCCs in the United States are associated with Hepatitis B or C Virus infection	 whereas others are associated with alcoholic cirrhosis; 44% of HCC samples that we evaluated harbored TERT promoter mutations (27/61). This finding makes TERT the most commonly mutated gene yet observed in this tumor type (21	 22). The mutations seemed to occur relatively early in tumorigenesis	 because they were observed in 39% of stage I well-differentiated HCCs (Table S1). TERT mutations were observed in virally associated tumors as well as cases without any underlying liver disease at similar frequencies (Table S1). There was also no difference in the prevalence of TERT promoter mutations with respect to sex	 age	 or ethnicity (Table S1). ALT has been observed in 7% of 121 HCCs studied previously (13).  Urinary tract cancers. Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder is the fourth most common type of cancer in American males. In 2013	 over 73	000 patients will be diagnosed with bladder cancer leading to approximately 15	000 deaths in the US alone (23). Two-thirds of the 21 urothelial carcinomas of the bladder that we studied harbored TERT promoter mutations. We were also able to evaluate 19 urothelial carcinomas of the upper urinary tract	 a much less common anatomic site for this histopathologic subtype of tumor. Nine of nineteen upper urinary tract urothelial carcinomas harbored TERT mutations. TERT mutations are	 therefore	 the most frequently mutated genes yet identified in urothelial carcinoma of either the bladder or upper urinary tract (24). The prevalence of ALT in bladder cancers is very low (1% of 188 cancers) (13).  Head and neck cancers. Head and neck cancers are almost always squamous cell carcinomas and can occur throughout the oral cavity lining (mucous membranes of the cheek	 hard and soft palate	 tongue	 supraglottis	 etc.). It is the sixth most common cancer in the world	 and 50	000 cases occurred in the United States in 2012. We identified TERT promoter mutations in 17% of 70 oral cavity cancers that we evaluated. However	 the anatomic distribution of the cases with TERT promoter mutations was striking: 11 of 12 cancers with TERT promoter mutations were in the oral tongue	 although only 23 of 70 total cases originated in the oral tongue (P < 0.0001	 Fisher exact probability test	 two-tailed) (Table S2). The basis for this extraordinary selectivity is curious given the shared characteristics of the squamous epithelium lining the tongue and other parts of the head and neck	 including the oral cavity. Moreover	 we evaluated 22 squamous cell carcinomas of another site (the cervix) and found only one TERT mutation (4.5%) (Table 1). Most cervical squamous cell carcinomas and a subset of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas are caused by human papillomavirus	 which can activate telomerase by expressing E6 and E7 viral oncogenes (25). These findings raise the possibility that human papillomavirus infection and TERT mutation may be alternative mechanisms to activate telomerase among squamous cell carcinomas. We were unable to test correlations between TERT promoter mutations and HPV status or other clinical parameters because of the small number of patients with available data (Table S2). There have been no ALT cases identified among 70 head and neck cancers	 including 41 oral cavity cancers (13).  Medulloblastomas. Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor of childhood (26). TERT mutations occurred in 21% of 91 medulloblastomas that we evaluated. As with the oral cavity cancers	 TERT mutations were not distributed randomly among the medulloblastoma patients. Although medulloblastomas are usually diagnosed at a young age	 those medulloblastomas with TERT mutations were diagnosed at a considerably older age (median = 6 vs. 16 y	 P = 0.0012	 t test assuming unequal variances	 two-tailed) (Fig. S1A). This observation has important implications for understanding the basis for the selectivity of the tumor types harboring TERT promoter mutations (Discussion); 45 of 90 patients had been assessed previously for orthodenticle homeobox 2 (OTX2) gene amplification and expression	 and alterations in this transcription factor are known to correlate with clinically distinct molecular subtypes of medulloblastoma (27). OTX2 expression was >100-fold higher in medulloblastoma patients without TERT promoter mutations than in those patients with TERT promoter mutations (note the log scale in Fig. S1B). The high levels of OTX2 expression were usually the result of OTX2 gene amplification (Fig. S1C). The association of TERT promoter mutations with an older age at diagnosis and a lack of OTX2 overexpression raises the possibility that TERT mutations occur in a specific clinical and molecular subtype of medulloblastoma. The most likely molecular subtype of medulloblastoma that may be enriched for TERT mutations is the noninfant sonic hedgehog subtype	 which is characterized by an older age at diagnosis and lower expression of OTX2 (28	 29). Larger studies will be needed to make this association more definitive. ALT has been observed in 7% of 55 medulloblastomas studied previously (13).  Gliomas. Gliomas are the most common CNS tumor type and accounted for >14	000 deaths in the United States last year (30). Histopathological and clinical criteria established by the World Health Organization are used to characterize these tumors into several subtypes (30). We considered the four main subtypes individually (Table S3).  Primary glioblastoma. These primary glioblastomas (GBMs) are the most common malignant brain tumors in adults	 accounting for âˆ¼17% of all intracranial tumors	 and they confer the worst survival (median of âˆ¼15 mo) (31). These high-grade (grade IV) tumors have no detectable precursor lesions and have been referred to as de novo tumors. The prevalence of TERT promoter mutations was remarkably high in GBMs of adults (83% of 78 tumors) (Table S3). This prevalence is higher than the prevalence of any other genetic mutation in this tumor type (32). These findings provide a molecular mechanism responsible for the high levels of TERT mRNA and telomerase activity observed in GBMs (33).  For 51 of 78 primary GBM tumors	 data on other common genetic alterations as well as clinical data were available (Fig. 2A). Interestingly	 EGFR amplification	 a classic molecular feature of primary GBM	 exclusively occurred in tumors with TERT mutations (P = 0.0006	 Fisher exact probability test	 two-tailed). Conversely	 no association was identified between TERT mutation and either TP53 mutation or CDKN2A deletion. Importantly	 the frequency of TERT promoter mutations was considerably less in primary GBMs of pediatric patients (11% of 19 tumors) than adult patients (Discussion) (Table S3). ALT was observed in 11% of 105 adult GBM and 44% of pediatric GBM (i.e.	 the reverse of the pattern observed for TERT promoter mutations) (13). Primary GBM patients without TERT mutations survived considerably longer	 on average	 than patients with such mutations (median = 27 vs. 14 mo	 P = 0.01 by the log rank test) (Fig. S3).  Fig. 2. Fig. 2. Mutations of selected genes in glioma subtypes. (A) Distribution of TERT mutations and other genetic events in 51 primary GBMs. (B) Distribution of TERT mutations and other genetic events among 40 astrocytomas	 including grades IIâ€“III astrocytomas ... Astrocytomas. Infiltrative astrocytic tumors frequently progress	 with recurrent lesions often of higher grade than the original lesions excised at surgery. They are most often grade II or III but can progress to grade IV (at which point they are often termed secondary GBMs). Astrocytomas of any stage rarely contained TERT promoter mutations (10% of 40 total samples) (Table S3). Instead	 they more frequently contained isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) or isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) mutations (75% of 40 tumors)	 ATRX mutations (70% of 40 tumors)	 and TP53 mutations (73% of 40 tumors) (Fig. 2B). ALT has been observed in 63% of 57 astrocytomas	 consistent with the high prevalence of ATRX mutations (13). The lack of activating TERT mutations in IDH1 mutant tumors is also corroborated by the lack of TERT mRNA and telomerase activity observed in these lesions (33).  Oligodendrogliomas. Like astrocytomas	 oligodendrogliomas often progress	 and they frequently contain TERT promoter mutations (78% of 45 tumor samples) (Table S3). Oligodendroglioma was the only tumor type studied (of all types	 including non-CNS tumors) (Dataset S1) in which C250T mutations were nearly as frequent as C228T mutations. In oligodendrogliomas	 43% of tumors with TERT mutations contained C250T substitutions	 whereas in other gliomas	 only 10% did (P < 0.001	 Fisher exact probability test	 two-tailed). Interestingly	 91% of 45 oligodendrogliomas that were evaluated for ATRX and TERT sequence alterations contained either an ATRX coding or a TERT promoter mutation	 suggesting that genetic alterations resulting in telomere maintenance are required for tumorigenesis of this subtype.  Oligodendrogliomas have long been known to contain characteristic losses of chromosome arms 1p and 19q	 and these losses reflect inactivation of the CIC gene on chromosome 19q and in some cases	 inactivation of the FUBP1 gene on chromosome 1p (34â€“36). Accordingly	 78% of 45 oligodendrogliomas contained chromosome arm 1p or 19q losses of heterozygosity (Fig. 2C) (34â€“36). Moreover	 nearly all of them contained IDH1 or IDH2 mutations (93%).  Oligoastrocytomas. As their name implies	 these tumors are mixed	 with histologic features of both oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas. This mixture	 in part	 reflects the difficulties in distinguishing the various glioma subtypes from one another on the basis of histopathologic or clinical criteria (37). The genetic features of this tumor subtype reflect this mixture: the prevalence of TERT promoter mutations (25% of 24 tumors) was intermediate between oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas	 as were the frequencies of chromosome (Chr) 1p/19q losses and IDH1/2	 TP53	 and ATRX mutations (Fig. 2D).  ALT Vs. TERT. ALT has been observed in tumors of the CNS (particularly gliomas) more frequently than tumors of any other tissue type. Given that TERT promoter mutations are also common in gliomas	 the relationship between these two features could be determined with high confidence. The tumors depicted in Fig. 2 had previously been evaluated for alterations in ATRX	 which is a nearly perfect surrogate for the ALT phenotype (11	 37). Our data show that there were 50 gliomas with ATRX mutations and 83 gliomas with TERT mutations; 0 of 83 tumors with TERT mutations contained ATRX mutations (P < 0.0001	 Fisher exact probability test	 two-tailed).  Go to: DISCUSSION The results described above	 as well as the results published in refs. 14 and 15	 provide evidence that supports one of the hypotheses raised in the Introduction and refutes others. The first of these hypotheses was that TERT mutations would only be observed in tumors derived from tissues that are not constantly self-renewing under normal circumstances. This hypothesis was supported in part: the vast majority of TERT promoter mutations occurred in tumors derived from tissues that do not continually self-renew. The TERT-H tumor types include only melanomas	 certain subtypes of glioma	 medulloblastomas	 squamous cell cancers of the tongue	 liposarcomas	 HCCs	 and urinary tract cancers. The normal transitional cells of the urinary tract have very low proliferative indices (0.64% Â± 0.52%)	 much lower than indices of gastrointestinal tract	 bone marrow	 or skin (38). Normal hepatocytes also do not turnover often (39)	 and glial cells are thought to have limited capacity for self-renewal (40).  Two other observations also support the hypothesis. Pediatric primary GBMs rarely contained TERT mutations (11%)	 whereas adult primary GBMs frequently did (83%). Pediatric GBMs are presumably derived from cells that are still dividing at the time of tumor initiation	 and therefore	 there is no selective advantage conferred by activating telomerase through a genetic mutation. Adult GBMs	 in contrast	 are presumably derived from postmitotic cells	 and they should require telomerase activation. Similarly	 medulloblastomas are embryonal tumors that typically arise from precursor cells with high self-renewal rates that do not usually persist in adults. This finding is consistent with our observation that the mean age of medulloblastoma patients with TERT mutations was considerably older than the mean age of medulloblastoma patients without TERT mutations (Fig. S1A).  There are	 however	 exceptions that belie the hypothesis that TERT mutations occur only in nonâ€“self-renewing tissues. The epithelium that lines the tongue constantly self-renews	 but many squamous carcinomas of the tongue harbored TERT mutations (Table S2). Additionally	 the squamous epithelia of the tongue certainly would not be expected to self-renew less than other squamous epithelia of the oral cavity	 but the latter rarely harbored TERT mutations (Table S2). This finding may suggest that squamous carcinomas of the tongue originate from a different cell of origin than other oral cavity squamous carcinomas. Conversely	 only a subset of the tumor types derived from nonâ€“self-renewing tissues was TERT-H. For example	 the TERT-H tumors included myxoid liposarcomas but not synovial sarcomas. Moreover	 cells of the pancreas (the islets of Langerhans and the ductal epithelial cells) rarely renew	 but pancreatic tumors of all types (pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors	 acinar carcinomas	 and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas) were all TERT-L. The most that we can conclude at present is that nonâ€“self-renewing cell types are the major sources of TERT-H tumors but that nonâ€“self-renewal is only one of the factors that determines whether tumor cells with TERT promoter mutations will have a selective growth advantage over adjoining cells.  The first corollary to the hypothesis raised in the Introduction was that tumor types that displayed ALT would be those types that harbored TERT promoter mutations. This corollary is soundly refuted by these data	 at least in general terms. Although tumor types of the CNS and liposarcomas had high frequencies of ALT as well as high frequencies of TERT promoter mutations	 these tumor types were the exceptions rather than the rule. For example	 pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors have very high frequencies of ALT but no evidence of TERT mutations. Conversely	 bladder cancers frequently have TERT mutations but never have ALT (13). Additionally	 even among gliomas	 pediatric GBMs have high frequencies of ALT and low frequencies of TERT mutations	 whereas adult GBMs have the reverse pattern.  The second corollary was that the selective advantage afforded by TERT mutation would be equivalent to the advantage afforded by ATRX mutation (conferring ALT). This hypothesis was most effectively tested in gliomas	 in which both ATRX coding and TERT promoter mutations were common. There was a striking mutual exclusivity with respect to ATRX and TERT mutations (P < 0.0001)	 lending strong support to this idea.  These results also raise many unanswered questions. In some tumor types	 such as gliomas	 we can imagine that all tumors have genetically activated telomere maintenance programs through mutations in either TERT or ATRX. However	 in other tumor types with frequent ATRX mutations	 such as pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors	 what is responsible for activating telomerase in the fraction of cases not exhibiting ALT if it is not a mutation in the TERT promoter? Similarly	 what is responsible for activating telomerase in those tumors derived from nonâ€“self-renewing cell types in which neither ALT nor TERT mutations is frequently observed	 such as synovial sarcomas or osteosarcomas? Also	 there are occasional individual tumors among the TERT-L types that have TERT promoter mutations (e.g.	 cervical cancers	 ovarian cancers	 and in ref. 15	 lung cancers). What distinguishes these occasional cancers from others of the same histopathologic subtype? Whole-genome sequencing studies	 rather than those studies limited to the exome	 might provide answers to these questions.  The results recorded here have practical as well as basic scientific implications. Two-thirds of bladder cancers had TERT promoter mutations	 making it the most commonly mutated gene yet identified in invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. Given the persistently high mortality rate despite multimodality treatment in this group of patients	 these mutations represent ideal urinary biomarkers to detect bladder cancers at an early stage and to follow patients for evidence of progression or recurrence once they have been diagnosed (41). Similarly	 the high prevalence of TERT promoter mutations in HCCs and glioma subtypes provides excellent candidate biomarkers for early detection (HCC) or monitoring (HCC in the plasma and gliomas in the cerebrospinal fluid) (42	 43).  Another practical implication involves diagnostics. We conjecture that tumors with TERT promoter or ATRX mutations are derived from different precursor cells and that either type of precursor cell is different from those types that are the precursors of tumors without such mutations. This distinction could aid classification of the tumors in clinically meaningful ways. For example	 Fig. 2 and Fig. S2 outline the major genetic alterations occurring in the three most common types of gliomas. On the basis of the data in Fig. 2 Aâ€“C	 we speculate that oligodendrogliomas that lack TERT mutations but contain ATRX mutations may behave more like astrocytomas than oligodendrogliomas and vice versa. Similarly	 the primary GBMs without TERT mutations (15% of the total) may behave more like advanced progressive astrocytomas	 which generally lack TERT mutations. This possibility is supported by the observation that those primary GBM patients without TERT mutations had a longer survival	 on average	 than other primary GBM patients (Fig. S3).  Go to: METHODS All clinical information and tissue were obtained with consent and Institutional Review Board approval from the various institutions donating material to this study	 and they were obtained in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Tissue sections were reviewed by board-certified pathologists to ensure that â‰¥50% of the cells used for DNA purification were neoplastic and confirm histopathological diagnosis. Oligonucleotides with the sequences 5â€²-M13-GGCCGATTCGACCTCTCT-3â€² and 5â€²-AGCACCTCGCGGTAGTGG-3â€²	 where M13 is a universal sequencing priming site with sequence 5â€²-tgtaaaacgacggccagt-3â€²	 were used to PCR-amplify the proximal TERT promoter containing C228 and C250 (chr5: 1	295	228; chr5: 1	295	250	 respectively; hg19) for Sanger sequencing using standard methods (44). Primary GBM copy number data as well as ALT status were derived from the data published in refs. 37	45	 and 46	 and OTX2 copy number expression was derived from the data published in ref. 27. Brain tumor patients were treated at the Tisch Brain Tumor Center at Duke. For the purposes of this study	 secondary GBM designates a GBM that was resected >1 y after a prior diagnosis of a lower-grade glioma (grades Iâ€“III)	 and all other GBMs were considered to be primary GBMs. Pediatric GBM samples were defined as those samples occurring before 21 y of age.   																																																																																																																																																																									
4	32||Heterozygous mutations in the telomerase components TERT	 the reverse transcriptase	 and TERC	 the RNA template	 cause autosomal dominant dyskeratosis congenita due to telomere shortening. Anticipation	 whereby the disease severity increases in succeeding generations due to inheritance of shorter telomeres	 is a feature of this condition. Here we describe 2 families in which 2 TERT mutations are segregating. Both families contain compound heterozygotes. In one case the proband is homozygous for a novel mutation causing a P704S substitution	 while his father's second allele encodes an H412Y mutation. The proband in the second family has mutant alleles Y846C and H876Q. Transfection studies show codominant expression of the mutated alleles with no evidence of a dominant negative effect or of intragenic complementation. Thus in these families the expression of both TERT alleles and the inherited telomere length contribute to the clinical phenotype.  Go to: Introduction Mutations in genes encoding components of the telomerase ribonucleoprotein complex resulting in very short telomeres have been identified in patients with dyskeratosis congenita (DC)	 a rare inherited bone marrow failure syndrome.1â€“6 X-linked DC is caused by mutations in the DKC1 gene	 encoding a protein necessary for the stabilization of the TERC RNA. Individuals with autosomal dominant DC (AD DC) are heterozygous for mutations in the telomerase RNA TERC or the gene encoding the catalytic subunit TERT.2â€“5 In contrast to patients with X-linked DC	 who usually develop severe disease with a high penetrance	 disease penetrance and expressivity in AD DC are highly variable and	 in addition to the gene mutation	 the inheritance of short telomeres is required for the manifestation of the disease.7	8 Here we demonstrate that the inheritance of AD DC may be complex. We report a DC patient homozygous for a TERT mutation and compound heterozygotes in 2 separate families with apparent codominance of the 2 mutations  Go to: Methods Clinical and genetic information was obtained through our ongoing study on the molecular mechanisms of bone marrow failure (http://bmf.im.wustl.edu). The study is approved by the Washington University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board. Informed consent was obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. DNA for mutation analysis was extracted from peripheral blood cells (Qiagen	 Valencia	 CA). Telomere length measurements in peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC) by flow-FISH and direct DNA sequencing were previously described.8 Primers used are shown in Table S1 (available on the Blood website; see the Supplemental Materials link at the top of the online article).  The mutations identified were introduced in the p3.1+ TERT plasmid9 using the QuickChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene	 La Jolla	 CA). Wild-type (WT) or mutant TERT plasmid (4 Î¼g) were transfected into WI-38 VA-13 cells at 80% confluence in the presence of an equal amount of pUC TERC using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen	 Carlsbad	 CA).10 In cotransfection experiments	 2 Î¼g of each mutant TERT plasmid were used. Thirty-six hours after transfection	 telomerase activities were determined in cell lysates at protein concentrations of 40	10	2.5	 and 0.625 ng using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR)â€“based TRAP assay as previously described.11  Go to: Results and discussion Figure 1A shows the pedigrees of families 199 and 284.

His clinical manifestations include short stature; elfin appearance; esophageal stricture; leukoplakia of the buccal mucosa	 anus	 and penis; abnormal pigmentation of his neck	 trunk	 and back; hyperkeratosis of his palms; ridged fingernails; avascular necrosis of both hips; tooth loss; chronic diarrhea; learning difficulties; pulmonary infiltrates; and progressive bone marrow failure (Figure 1B). His 61-year-old father was diagnosed with osteoporosis at the age of 60. His 60-year-old mother is healthy. Both parents have normal peripheral blood cell counts. The paternal grandmother (age	 84 years) has a history of anemia	 osteoporosis	 and pulmonary fibrosis. The maternal grandmother was reported to have died at the age of 60 years because of pulmonary fibrosis.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Pedigrees and clinical manifestations in TERT mutations (A) Pedigrees and identified TERT gene mutations in families 199 and 284. Circles	 females; squares	 males; white	 wild type; color	 mutant as indicated in the chart. Half-filled symbols indicate ... Mutation analysis revealed that patient 199.1 is homozygous for a C to T transition in exon 5 of the TERT gene (cDNA nt C2110T) causing a proline to serine substitution at amino acid 704 (P704S). Functional analysis in WI-38 VA-13 cells demonstrated that the TERT P704S mutation severely reduces telomerase activity to 13% of normal (P < .001; Figure 2A). Both parents are heterozygous for the TERT P704S mutation (Figure 1A). Interestingly	 however	 the father carries a second TERT mutation in exon 2. This C1234T mutation (H412Y)	 has been previously described in an unrelated family.3 This mutation reduced telomerase activity to 36% of normal in our transfection experiments (P < .001; Figure 2A). Coexpression of WT TERT with either the P704S or H412Y variants did not show evidence of a dominant negative effect. The coexpression of the 2 TERT mutations resulted in an intermediate telomerase activity of 22% (P < .001; Figure 2B)	 suggesting a synergic effect on telomerase activity and no intragenic complementation. Careful analysis of the family tree revealed that the parents are fourth cousins	 explaining the presence of the TERT P704S mutation in both parents.  Figure 2 Figure 2 Telomerase activity and telomere lengths of wild-type and mutant individuals. (A) In vitro telomerase activity of the mutant TERT proteins in WI-38 VA-13 cells. WI-38 VA-13 cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing the mutant TERT cDNA sequences ... Telomere length measurement in family 199 revealed that patient 199.1 has very short telomeres (below the 1st percentile of the normal telomere length distribution; Figure 2C). Interestingly	 the father (199.2)	 who is compound heterozygous for the TERT P704S and H412Y mutations	 has also very short telomeres	 whereas the mother (199.3)	 who is heterozygous for TERT P704S mutation	 has a normal telomere length.  Patient 284.1 is an 8-year-old girl of European descent	 originally diagnosed with moderate but progressive aplastic anemia. Both of her parents are healthy with no abnormalities in the peripheral blood. Family history was negative for blood diseases	 pulmonary fibrosis	 or cancer.  Mutation analysis revealed 2 different TERT gene sequence alterations. The A2537G in exon 9 (Y846C) and C2628G mutation in exon 10 (H876Q). Further analysis showed that the TERT Y846C mutation was inherited from the mother	 whereas the TERT H876Q mutation was inherited from her father	 indicating that patient 284.1 is a compound heterozygote for the 2 TERT gene mutations (Figure 1A). Both TERT gene mutations result in a significantly reduced telomerase activity after transfection into WI-38 VA-13 cells to 10% (P < .001) and 50% (P < .001) of normal (Figure 2A)	 whereas the cotransfection of the 2 mutants results in a telomerase activity of 38% (P = .004; Figure 2B).  Telomere length in peripheral blood cells from patient 284.1 was very short	 below the 1st percentile of normal and so were those measured in her mother (284.2) and in one of her uncles (284.4)	 both of whom carry the TERT Y846C mutation. Telomere length in her father (284.3) heterozygous for the TERT H876Q mutation was between the 1st and 5th percentile of normal (Figure 2C).  In conclusion	 we have identified 3 novel and 1 recurrent TERT gene mutation in 2 families who were thought to have sporadic DC and idiopathic aplastic anemia. All 4 mutations are hypomorphic mutations	 impairing	 but not eliminating telomerase activity. Homozygous hypomorphic TERT mutations have recently been found to cause disease in 2 consanguineous families.12 Here we demonstrate that in a nonconsanguineous family compound heterozygosity for TERT can cause disease and that the involvement of TERT in the pathogenesis of DC is probably more complex than initially anticipated. Our data indicate that in compound heterozygosity or homozygosity for hypomorphic TERT mutations the mutant alleles are codominant and suggest that severity of telomerase dysfunction and the inheritance of short telomeres determine the clinical phenotype and onset of disease. Codominant inheritance has also been found in one family with 2 hypomorphic TERC gene mutations	13 whereas compound heterozygosity or homozygosity for TERC or TERT null mutations have never been reported	 suggesting that in humans	 in contrast to mice	 biallelic TERC or TERT null mutations are probably not compatible with life. The consideration that both sides of the family may be affected even in nonconsanguineous families might have important implications for the patient in the selection of a potential sibling donor as well as for the prognosis and management of other family members carrying one or 2 of the identified gene mutations.  																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																
2	33||The current World Health Organization classification of melanocytic tumors recognizes four major melanoma subtypes based on clinicopathologic features but with a very little prognostic relevance. Among them	 acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) has distinct epidemiologic and clinicopathologic features. Studies with comparative genomic hybridization have demonstrated that ALMs are characterized as having a high frequency of amplifications in small genomic regions.1 Some of these amplifications contain genes involved in oncogenesis and tumor progression	 such as cyclin D1 (CCND1) at 11q13 and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT ) at 5p15.33.2 In a series of 43 formalin-fixed and paraffinembedded samples of infiltrating ALM	 we have studied CCND1 and TERT gene status by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). For CCND1	 the Fig 1. Urgency rating by urgent access clinic attending dermatologist categorized by diagnostic accuracy of referring providers. J AM ACAD DERMATOL VOLUME 71	 NUMBER 4 Letters 839 commercially available probe LSI Cyclin D1/CEP 11 (Vysis; Abbott Molecular	 Des Plaines	 IL) was used. For TERT	 noncommercial FISH probes using bacterial artificial chromosomes were developed and MCTP1 gene was used as chromosome control	 as previously described.3 Gene amplifications were considered when the ratio between gene copy number and centromere or chromosome control copy number was greater than 2. FISH results were correlated with clinicopathologic parameters. The main clinicopathologic features of the cohort collected at diagnosis and their relationship with overall survival (OS) are expressed in Table I. Overall	 the median follow-up period was 30 months (mean: 33.98; range: 1-161). CCND1 gene amplifications were found in 10 cases (23.3%) with a median CCND1-to-CEP11 ratio of 4.16 and TERT gene amplifications were detected in 9 cases (20.9%)	 with a median TERT-to-MCTP1 ratio of 3.10. CCND1 and TERT amplifications were mutually exclusive. Fig 1 shows a FISH image of an ALM harboring TERT gene amplification. In univariate survival analysis	 TERT amplifications significantly reduced OS (P Â¼ .025)	 while the patients with CCND1 amplifications had no significant differences in OS (P Â¼.987) (see Table I). In multivariate survival analysis	 Breslow index and TERT amplifications retained significance for OS (P Â¼ .006; hazard ratio [HR] 9.20; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.90-44.59 and P Â¼ .019; HR 4.63; 95% CI 1.29-16.62	 respectively). In this preliminary study	 we are reporting the prognostic value of TERT gene amplification evaluated by FISH in a series of ALMs. TERT is a gene encoding for the catalytic subunit of telomerase reverse transcriptase. Gene amplification is the most frequent mechanism for TERT activation	 promoting cell survival and proliferation. However	 the prognostic relevance of TERT amplification has only been proved in non-small cell lung carcinomas	 to date.4 Recently	 recurrent somatic mutations in the TERT promoter region have been described in some cancers	 including melanomas. They could represent an additional potential mechanism of TERT activation	 different from the well-recognized TERT copy number gains. In fact	 a more recent study has demonstrated that TERT promoter mutations are uncommon in ALMs.5 These results are consistent with the supposed relation of these mutations with the UV light exposure and supports the evidence that melanomas may show different pathogenesis depending on body site and levels of sun exposure.1 Interestingly	 we found TERT and CCND1 gene amplifications in different ALM subsets	 and they were mutually exclusive in accordance with previous studies.2 This fact suggests that ALM may have different pathways of oncogenesis. Further studies including a larger number of cases are needed to confirm our results.  Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein enzyme complex that adds telomeric repeats to the ends of chromosomes. The core telomerase components are the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) catalytic subunit	 and the telomerase RNA (TR) template subunit. In most cancers	 telomerase is expressed at levels that are substantially higher than in normal cells. A known consequence of telomerase up-regulation which is considered to play a critical role in oncogenesis is maintenance of telomere length	 and thus evasion by cancer cells of the normal limits on proliferation that are associated with the steady decrease in telomere length that accompanies proliferation of normal cells. It has also been suggested that telomerase up-regulation confers other advantages on cancer cells independent of its enzymatic activity. The mechanisms responsible for up-regulation of telomerase in cancer are incompletely understood. Here we review evidence suggesting that this frequently results from increased copy number of the genes encoding telomerase components. The TERT gene is located at human chromosome band 5p15.33	 and the telomerase RNA component (TERC) gene that encodes TR is at 3q26.3. Chromosomal gains and gene amplifications involving chromosome arms 5p and 3q are among the most frequent in human tumors. Increased TERT and TERC gene dosage has been detected frequently in a variety of human cancers	 and clonal evolution of cells with increased TERT or TERC copy number has been observed	 suggesting a growth advantage in cells with increased TERT or TERC gene dosage. (Cancer Sci 2008; 99: 1092â€“1099) Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein enzyme complex that adds telomeric repeats to the ends of chromosomes.(1) The active human telomerase enzyme is composed of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT)	 human telomerase RNA (hTR) and dyskerin.(2) hTERT (encoded by the TERT gene) is the catalytic reverse transcriptase component(3)	 hTR (encoded by the TERC gene) serves as the RNA template for the addition of telomeric repeats(4) and dyskerin (encoded by the DKC1 gene) is an RNA binding protein.(5) Mutations in any of these components may result in dyskeratosis congenita	 a human disease syndrome associated with short telomeres (reviewed in Kirwan et al.(6)).  Telomerase activity has been detected in more than 85% of human tumors(7) whereas in normal human somatic cells it is either undetectable or present at low levels. In normal cells	 telomeres shorten with every cell division	 and this eventually results in senescence	 a state characterized by permanent withdrawal from the cell division cycle. The increased telomerase activity found in cancers prevents telomere shortening	 and allows cancer cells to escape the normal limits on cellular proliferation (reviewed in Colgin et al.(8)). When exogenous hTERT is expressed in normal cells	 telomere shortening is prevented	 and immortalization may occur.(9	10) Furthermore	 inhibition of telomerase activity leads to senescence or apoptosis of tumor cells(11â€“13) indicating that telomerase activity is required for their long-term viability. Up-regulation of telomerase activity resulting in telomere length maintenance is therefore thought to be critical for oncogenesis. There is evidence	 however	 that TERT can also promote cell proliferation independently of the telomere-lengthening enzymatic activity of telomerase. For example	 mouse TERT (mTERT) overexpression in mouse skin stimulates the proliferation of hair-follicle stem cells and facilitates robust hair growth; this effect is independent of telomerase activity because mTERT overexpression in mice that lack the RNA component results in the same effect.(14)  In view of the observations that hTR is ubiquitously expressed	(4	15) whereas hTERT is expressed only in telomerase-positive cells(3) and that expression of exogenous hTERT alone can immortalize normal human cells	(9	10) abundance of hTERT was previously thought to be the sole limiting factor for telomerase activity. However	 evidence is increasing in support of the notion that hTR levels can also be limiting for telomerase activity. For example	 overexpression of both hTERT and hTR substantially increased telomerase activity	 whereas overexpression of either hTR or hTERT alone induced telomerase activity to a lesser extent.(16) The consequences for telomerase activity of overexpression of the other known telomerase component	 dyskerin	 are currently unknown	 and there is no information available to indicate whether availability of this subunit is also limiting.  Changes in the copy number (gains and losses) of whole chromosomes or chromosome arms have been observed in a large number of human tumors (reviewed in Rooney et el.(17)). The chromosome arms that are most frequently gained include 8q (27.7% of tumors)	 1q (25.1%)	 7q (23.1%)	 7p (21.5%)	 17q (18.5%)	 3q (16.4%)	 20q (15.5%) and 5p (13.2%).(17) TERT has been mapped to chromosome 5 at 5p15.33(18) and TERC has been mapped to chromosome 3 at 3q26.3;(19) that is	 both the TERT and TERC genes are located in regions frequently involved in chromosomal gains. The gene encoding dyskerin	 DKC1	 is located on Xq28	 a region that is also known to be involved in amplification or chromosome gains in cancer cells.(17	20) However	 there is no information available about whether the DKC1 gene itself is amplified in human cancer.  Gene amplification refers to the situation where there is an array of copies of a restricted region of a chromosome(21) and the region of the chromosome that becomes amplified is referred to as the â€˜ampliconâ€™. Gene amplification is common in human cancers and is considered to be one of the mechanisms of oncogene activation. Both the TERT and TERC gene loci are located on chromosome regions that are frequently amplified in human cancers. For example	 chromosome 5p is often amplified in neuroblastoma	 lung cancer	 squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCC-HN)	 carcinoma of the cervix	 medulloblastoma and osteosarcoma.(20	22	23) Amplifications involving 3q have been consistently detected in ovarian carcinoma	(24) carcinoma of the cervix	 lung cancer and SCC-HN (reviewed in Knuutila et al.(20)).  This present study reviews the evidence that the gene dosage of TERT and TERC are often increased in human tumors. It should be noted that most studies reviewed here do not distinguish between chromosomal gain and gene amplification. Nevertheless	 the outcome for the cell could be similar: both lead to an increase in gene dosage. We propose that increased TERT and TERC gene dosage may promote oncogenesis both through telomerase enzyme activity and possibly in activity-independent ways. The possible clinical implications are also discussed. Increased TERT copy number in cancer  Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and Southern blot analysis using probes containing TERT sequences or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers specific for TERT have demonstrated copy number increases of the TERT gene in multiple tumors or immortalized cell lines (Table 1). For example	 FISH analysis using a probe that covered the genomic region encoding TERT together with a specific sequence at 5q31 as a marker probe detected two TERT gene copies located on band 5p15.33 and a 1:1 ratio of TERT/5q31 signal in normal cells. However	" only 5 of 26 human tumor cell lines from different origins and 28 of 58 human primary tumors carried two TERT and two 5q31 marker copies. The remainder of the cell lines and primary tumors had more than two copies of TERT and a TERT/5q31 ratio â‰¥1.(25) Some of these (50% of cell lines and 22% of primary tumors) displayed 3â€“4 TERT copies/cell(25) while 31% of cell lines and 30% of human primary tumors had â‰¥5 copies of TERT per cell.(25)  Table 1.

For example	 PCR analysis using primer sets specific for TERT and control sequences on 5q (5qSTS) detected a TERT/5qSTS ratio that ranged from 0.1 to 17.6 in 36 central nervous system (CNS) embryonal tumors whereas a mean ratio of 1.02 (ranging from 0.99 to 1.12) was detected in eight normal subjects.(26) In this study	 42% of CNS embryonal tumors had a TERT/5qSTS ratio â‰¥2.17 and were considered to have TERT amplification.(26)  In various studies	 it was found that 25â€“31% of the cell lines examined had â‰¥5 TERT gene copies/cell in â‰¥40% of the cells. These included cell lines derived from neuroblastomas (Lan2	 Lan5 and SHEP1) and carcinomas of breast (578T)	 cervix (HeLa and CaSki) and lung (H125	 U1285	 U1752	 SHP77/97	 H1688	 Colo677/97	 H446/97	 BEN and H209).(25	27	28) Cell lines derived from bladder and epidermal carcinomas (5637 and A431) were reported to have â‰¥3 copies of hTERT per cell.(18) In primary tumors	 increased TERT copy number has been detected in neuroblastomas (12%)	 CNS embryonal tumors (42%)	 hepatocellular carcinomas (22%) and cancers of the lung (30â€“63%)	 cervix (24â€“30%)	 breast (26%) and colon (48%) (Table 1). In addition	 FISH analysis revealed 2â€“60 copies of TERT in leukemic cells.(29) It is worth noting that the threshold beyond which the TERT gene is considered to have increased copy number or to be amplified varies between studies. For example	 using FISH analysis	 Palmqvist et al. defined increased TERT copy number as â‰¥3 TERT copies/cell in â‰¥20% of the cells and detected 48% of 64 colorectal tumor samples that had increased TERT copy number.(30) In contrast	 using the same technique	 Zhang et al. defined TERT amplification as â‰¥5 TERT copies/cell in â‰¥20% of the cells and scored 24â€“30% of primary tumors as having TERT amplification.(25	27)  It is possible that the different thresholds for detection of TERT amplication may explain why some of the above-mentioned studies showed a correlation between increased TERT copy number and hTERT mRNA expression	 while others showed no association.(30â€“32) For example	 in a colorectal cancer study that used a low threshold (â‰¥3 copies of TERT per cell in â‰¥20% of the cells)	 hTERT mRNA expression did not correlate with TERT gene dosage.(30) Alternatively	 the discrepancy between TERT copy number and expression levels could be due to the different origins of the tumors and/or cell types. Observations from our laboratory are consistent with the latter explanation. We have identified increased TERT copy number in hTERT-immortalized human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) and in hTERT-immortalized human foreskin fibroblasts. Increased TERT copy number correlated with hTERT mRNA and protein expression in hTERT immortalized HMECs(33) but not in hTERT immortalized human foreskin fibroblasts (Cao et al. unpublished	 2007). Another possible explanation for the lack of correlation between amplification and hTERT expression is that the amplicon might contain an incomplete copy of the gene. Finally	 hTERT expression has been shown to be regulated at multiple levels involving transcription	 alternative splicing	 translation and post-translational events (for reviews	 see Horikawa et al.(34) and Ducrest et al.(35)) which provides additional potential explanations for why TERT gene dosage does not always correlate with hTERT expression.  Similarly	 no consistent correlation between TERT copy number and telomerase activity has been observed. While Zhang et al.(25) and Saretzki et al.(28) reported a correlation between TERT gene dosage and telomerase activity in different cell lines and primary tumors	 Palmqvist's study of colorectal primary tumor samples(30) and our studies of hTERT-immortalized HMECs(33) and human foreskin fibroblasts (Cao et al. unpublished	 2007) did not observe any correlation between TERT gene copy number and telomerase activity. This lack of correlation may be explained by the observation that telomerase is an enzyme complex composed of multiple components and the evidence (discussed below) that the levels of two of these components (hTERT and hTR) are limiting for telomerase activity. It should be noted that most of the published studies on increased TERT gene copy number have not investigated hTR levels. It is possible that hTR levels may limit telomerase activity in some tumors where increased TERT copy number does not correlate with telomerase activity. Our observation that hTR levels limit telomerase activity in mammary epithelial cells with TERT amplification(33) supports this possibility.  In various types of tumors	 increased TERT gene copy number has been found to have clinical and prognostic correlates. For example	 Zhu et al. showed that lung cancer patients with TERT amplification had poorer recurrence-free survival.(36) In hepatocellular carcinomas	 hTERT amplification was found to be associated with poorly differentiated histopathology	 which would be expected to correlate with poor outcome.(31) In melanomas	 increased TERT copy number was significantly associated with the melanoma subtypes and locations of metastases. For example	 increased TERT gene dosage was abundant in superficial spreading primary melanomas	 subcutaneous metastases and malignant effusion-derived cells	 but was completely absent or very rare in cells from primary nodular melanomas and brain	 bone and lymph node metastases.(32) Increased TERC copy number in cancer  Like TERT	 increased copy number of the TERC gene has been found in many tumor samples and immortalized cell lines by techniques such as FISH and Southern blot analysis using probes containing the TERC sequence (Table 2).

The most frequent increased TERC copy number pattern was 2-2-3 (copy number of CEP7-CEP3-hTR). One case showed high-level amplification of TERC (>20 copies) while the two centromere probes were still diploid.(40) Seven of 12 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1/CIN2 lesions that progressed to CIN3 carried extra copies of TERC (and all matched CIN3 lesions had extra copies of TERC)	 whereas 0/10 non-progressing CIN1/CIN2 lesions carried extra copies of TERC.(41) Even more strikingly	 extra copies of TERC were detected in 4/12 (33%) cytologically normal Pap smears from women who later developed CIN3 or cervical carcinomas (only 1â€“3 years after the normal Pap smears).(41) These results suggest that the detection of additional copies of the TERC gene in routinely collected Pap smears might be able to serve as an early and specific marker to identify lesions with a high progression risk.  Although FISH analysis using CEP7-CEP3-hTR probes in routinely collected Pap smears facilitated the visualization of extra copies of TERC in a single cell	 the threshold for determining whether the TERC copy number increase in the cell population is clinically significant needs careful definition. For example	 using a threshold of â‰¥5% of cells with multiple TERC signals and/or at least one observed cell with six or more TERC signals	 no normal Pap smears were positive	 but changing the threshold to â‰¥1% of cells with multiple TERC signals and/or at least one observed cell with five or more TERC signals	 resulted in 2/13 (15.4%) cytologically normal Pap smears being positive.(40) The clinical outcomes were not known in this study	 and it would be of great interest to determine whether the two women	 whose smears were positive when the lower threshold was used	 later developed high-grade lesions.  A correlation between TERC gene copy number and hTR expression level was observed in lung cancer(37) and leukemia(29) but not in melanoma.(32) No other studies have investigated the correlation between TERC gene copy number and hTR expression. Potential explanations for the non-correlation between TERT gene dosage and hTERT expression discussed before also apply to hTR. Like hTERT expression	 hTR expression is regulated at multiple levels (reviewed Cairney et al.(42))	 so a simple correlation between TERC gene dosage and hTR expression should not be expected.  Interestingly	 5 out of 50 (10%) cell cultures from melonomas displayed increased copy number of both TERT and TERC	 although it is not clear whether this can happen in the same cell.(32) Extra copies of TERT and TERC are both observed in leukemic cells	 but it cannot be ascertained from the publication whether extra copies of both genes were observed in the same samples.(29) None of the other publications reviewed here appear to have investigated the copy number of both genes	 but evidence from separate studies indicates that TERT and TERC are both frequently amplified in lung and cervical carcinomas (Tables 1 and 2). Given the recent evidence that TERT and TERC gene products are both limiting for telomerase activity	 it would be of considerable interest to know how frequently both genes are amplified in the same tumor or cell. Clonal overgrowth of cells with TERC or TERT amplification  Overgrowth of cells carrying additional copies of TERC appears to occur within cervical carcinomas.(40	41) Heselmeyer-Haddad et al. observed that in many instances cells with extra copies of TERC were located next to each other and this clustering increased with advanced dysplasia.(40	41) It is possible that cells carrying extra copies of TERC have a growth advantage	 which eventually results in a cervical carcinoma cell population in which the majority of the cells are positive for TERC amplification. It is not clear whether TERC amplification correlates with hTR expression or telomerase activity in this context	 and the mechanism of the putative promotion of cell growth by TERC amplification in cervical carcinomas awaits further investigation.  Our data indicate that a clone of cells with TERT amplification can overgrow all other cells in an in vitro cell population. Four independent hTERT-immortalized mass cultures (B80-TERT1	2	 3a and 3b) were obtained by transfecting HMECs with an hTERT expression plasmid.(43) Extensive amplification of the TERT transgene in B80-TERT1 cells was detected by FISH analysis of metaphase spreads using a probe containing full-length hTERT cDNA or a 650 bp N-terminal hTERT probe. A similar pattern of TERT amplification was observed in every metaphase (Fig. 1)	 indicating that this immortalized cell line has become clonal even though it was originally established as a mass culture. FISH analysis detected a different pattern of TERT amplification in another cell line (B80-TERT3b)	 and it had also become clonal because every metaphase had the same pattern.(33) These observations suggest that cells with TERT amplification may have acquired a growth advantage.  Figure 1.  Figure 1.

Fluorescein-avidin detection of hTERT is shown in green. DAPI staining of the nucleus is shown in blue. Top and bottom panels are two representative images from the whole cell population. hTERT and hTR roles beyond telomerase activity  As noted above	 increased TERT copy number in various tumors or cell lines does not always correlate with telomerase activity. A similar situation may also apply to increased TERC copy number. This could indicate that	 at least in some tumors	 the increases in copy number are simply random changes that reflect the genetic instability seen in cancers. Another potential explanation is that increased hTERT and hTR expression may promote carcinogenesis through a mechanism independent of the telomere-lengthening catalytic activity of telomerase.  Evidence that telomerase may promote tumorigenesis in ways beyond telomere length maintenance has been reviewed elsewhere (for example	 see reference	(44)). Some of the evidence suggesting that specific telomerase components can have pro-oncogenic functions beyond their contribution to telomerase enzyme activity is as follows. hTERT has been shown to promote cell survival and proliferation in human breast cancer PMC42 cells; this effect was independent of its telomere-lengthening catalytic activity because an hTERT mutant (D788N) that lacks telomerase catalytic activity had a similar pro-survival effect.(45) An independent study showed that a catalytically inactive dominant-negative mutant of hTERT antagonized p53-induced apoptosis as efficiently as wild-type hTERT.(46) A third study has shown that hTERT protects against Bcl-2â€“dependent apoptosis	 and that a dominant negative catalytically inactive mutant of hTERT had a similar antiapoptotic effect.(47) This antiapoptotic effect of hTERT that is independent of its catalytic activity was observed in three different human cancer cell lines: MCF7 breast cancer cells	 M14 melanoma cells	 and HCT116 colon cancer cells. Furthermore	 hTERT protected against Bcl-2â€“dependent apoptosis independently of p53	 because overexpression of hTERT antagonized apoptosis induced by a Bcl-2 inhibitor both in HCT116 p53+/+ and HCT116 p53â€“/â€“ cells.(47)  A role for TERT independent of telomerase activity has also been demonstrated in mouse stem cells.(14) Conditional expression of mTERT in mouse skin epithelium caused activation of quiescent stem cells in the hair follicle and a rapid transition from the resting phase (telogen) to the active phase of the hair follicle cycle (anagen).(14) Induction of anagen by mTERT overexpression facilitated robust hair growth	 regardless of whether mTR was expressed or not.(14) Furthermore	 a catalytically inactive mTERT mutant (D702A) had a similar hair growth promoting effect compared to wild-type mTERT.(48)  It is also possible that hTR may have a function independent of its role as the template for telomere lengthening. Kedde et al. showed that inhibition of hTR expression in a number of different human cells triggered a rapid growth arrest which was associated with p53 and CHK1 activation.(49) Moreover	 the rapid growth arrest resulting from hTR inhibition was independent of hTERT because a similar growth arrest and ATR activation was observed in a cell line (GM847) expressing no hTERT.(49) Both hTERT and hTR can be limiting for telomerase activity  Following the cloning of hTERT in 1997(3	50â€“52)	 it was shown that hTERT levels can be limiting for telomerase activity. hTERT expression is often undetectable in normal telomerase-negative cells	 whereas hTR is expressed at detectable levels. It was shown that introduction of hTERT expression constructs into normal human cells induced telomerase activity	 resulting in telomere length maintenance	 escape from senescence	 and extension of proliferative lifespan.(9	10	53) It was therefore deduced that hTERT levels are limiting	 and that the other telomerase components must be expressed at sufficient levels. Studies in mice also supported the limiting role of TERT. For example	 forced expression of mTERT in cardiac muscle in mice was sufficient to induce telomerase activity	 resulting in hyperplasia and hypertrophy of cardiac myocytes.(54)  It has recently become clear that hTR is also limiting for telomerase activity and telomere maintenance (reviewed in Cairney et al.(42)). Early clues included the observation that hTR expression is upregulated in telomerase-positive immortal cell lines in comparison to telomerase-negative mortal cell strains.(3	4) Moreover	 it has been observed that hTR levels are substantially elevated in a wide variety of human tumors.(55â€“59) Evidence that telomerase RNA levels may also be limiting in chicken cells is provided by the observation that oncogenic strains of Marek's disease virus (MDV) but not non-oncogenic strains encode a viral form of telomerase RNA (vTR)	 that shares 88% homology to chicken telomerase RNA.(60) MDV carrying both copies of vTR promoted malignant T cell lymphomagenesis in chickens	 whereas mutants of the oncogenic strain of MDV lacking one or both copies of vTR were impaired in their ability to induce T cell lymphomas.(61)  Direct evidence that hTR levels are limiting for telomerase activity was published recently by Lingner and colleagues	 who showed that concomitant overexpression of hTERT and hTR in several human cell lines resulted in higher levels of telomerase activity compared to hTERT or hTR overexpression alone.(16) It can therefore be concluded that hTERT and hTR levels both limit telomerase activity in these cell lines. hTR levels often become upregulated following transduction of normal cells with an hTERT expression construct(33	62)	 which probably explains why TERT levels alone were previously regarded as limiting. We also identified an hTERT-immortalized cell line in which hTR up-regulation was minimal.(33) In this latter cell line	 transduction by an hTR expression plasmid resulted in a large increase in telomerase activity and telomere lengthening. The reason that hTR levels are upregulated in response to hTERT overexpression most likely includes stabilization of hTR by binding to TERT(62)	 but there are other aspects of the mechanism that are currently unexplained.(33)  Further evidence that hTR is limiting for telomerase activity comes from the observation that TERC is haploinsufficient in both humans and mice. Dyskeratosis congenita is a human syndrome characterized by abnormally short telomeres and premature proliferative exhaustion in tissues such as the bone marrow	 and may be associated with mutations in various genes including TERC (reviewed in Kirwan et al.(6)). Although telomerase levels are insufficient to completely prevent telomere shortening in normal human cells	 highly proliferative tissues such as the bone marrow require normal levels of telomerase activity to maintain an adequate proliferative capacity. It appears that the TERC mutations associated with dyskeratosis congenita reduce telomerase activity via haploinsufficiency rather than by a dominant negative mechanism.(63) Studies in mouse knockout models also suggest that this gene is haploinsufficient.(64	65) Conclusions  On the basis of the evidence that the levels of both TERT and TERC are limiting for telomerase activity and that the copy number of these genes is frequently increased in cancers by chromosomal gains or by amplification	 we propose that increased TERT and/or TERC gene dosage is an important mechanism for upregulation of telomerase activity in human cancer. Interestingly	 transduction of normal cells with hTERT expression constructs may result in upregulation of endogenous hTR expression	 by mechanisms which are incompletely understood. Very little is currently known about changes in expression of the other known telomerase subunit	 dyskerin. More extensive surveys will be required to determine how common increased dosage of TERT and TERC is across a wider range of tumors	 and further studies are also required to determine whether dosage of both genes is frequently increased in the same tumors. It is also possible that the increased copy number of genes encoding telomerase components has prooncogenic effects in addition to the ability of telomerase to synthesize telomeric repeats	 prevent telomere shortening	 and permit cells to escape from senescence. Detection of TERT and/or TERC amplification may have useful applications in cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Realization of this potential will require robust definition of what constitutes a biologically significant increase in TERT or TERC copy number	 and more extensive studies of the clinical outcome in patient cohorts.  Telomerase activation through the induction of its catalytic component TERT is essential in carcinogenesis. The regulatory mechanism and clinical significance underlying cancer-specific TERT expression have been extensively investigated in various human malignancies	 but little is known about these in Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC)	 an aggressive neuroendocrine skin tumor. Here we addressed these issues by determining TERT promoter mutations	 gene amplification	 mRNA expression and association with clinical variables in MCC. TERT mRNA was expressed in 6/6 MCC cell lines and 41 of 43 tumors derived from 35 MCC patients. Telomerase activity was detectable in all 6 cell lines and 11 tumors analyzed. TERT promoter mutations were identified in 1/6 cell lines and 4/35 (11.4%) MCC cases. The mutation exhibited UV signature and occurred in sun-exposed areas. Increased TERT gene copy numbers were observed in 1/6 cell lines and 11/14 (79%) tumors	 and highly correlated with its mRNA expression (r = 0.7419	 P = 0.0024). Shorter overall survival was significantly associated with higher TERT mRNA levels in MCC patients (P = 0.032). Collectively	 TERT expression and telomerase activity is widespread in MCC	 and may be attributable to TERT promoter mutations and gene amplification. Higher TERT expression predicts poor patient outcomes.  Keywords: Gene amplification	 Merkel cell carcinoma	 MCV	 Promoter mutations	 Telomerase	 TERT Go to: INTRODUCTION Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC)	 a neuroendocrine skin malignancy	 is believed to originate from intraepidermal Merkel cells and predominantly occurs in the elderly population or immunocompromised individuals [1-4]. Although rare	 the annual incidence of MCC has significantly increased in last decades [1-4]. Moreover	 MCC is aggressive and has a mortality rate up to 33%	 higher than that of any other skin tumors including malignant melanoma [3-5]. Immunosuppression	 ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and infection of Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV) have been proposed to contribute to the development of MCC [3-5]	 however	 our current understanding of the disease pathogenesis remains limited. Clearly	 profound insights into the MCC pathophysiology are required to develop novel therapeutic strategies for the management and outcome improvement of MCC patients.  Telomerase is a RNA-dependent DNA polymerase responsible for lengthening telomere and silent in most normal human cells with a limited life-span [6-10]. It is well established that activation of telomerase is an essential step in malignant transformation	 and by stabilizing telomere length	 telomerase confers transformed cells an infinite proliferation potential [6-10]. Indeed	 numerous clinical observations have shown that telomerase activity is detectable in up to 90% of human malignancies [6-8]. Mechanistically	 induction of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) expression	 the catalytic component of telomerase	 is a key event activating telomerase [6	 9]. Thus	 how cancer-specific TERT expression is achieved has long been an important issue in cancer research	 but remains incompletely understood. The accumulated evidence has suggested that genetic factors play an important part in regulating TERT expression. We previously showed that TERT gene was frequently targeted for amplification in carcinogenesis	 which contributed to telomerase activation in human malignancies [11	 12]. It has also been shown that certain single nucleotide polymorphisms increase cancer risk by up-regulating TERT expression and telomerase activity [13]. More recently	 somatic TERT promoter mutations namely C228T and C250T have been identified as novel gain-of-function genetic events in up to 80% of malignant melanoma and other kinds of cancer [14-25]. All these findings	 not only provide insights into telomerase activation in carcinogenesis	 but also reveal clinical significance of telomerase/TERT-related assessments in cancer diagnosis and outcome prediction. Furthermore	 targeting telomerase or telomere maintenance has been suggested as a novel anti-cancer strategy [26	 27].  Despite numerous existing data on telomerase/TERT in various types of human malignancies	 little is known about these in MCC	 and there has been so far only been one published report showing that telomerase activity was detected in 4/4 tumor biopsies from 4 MCC patients and in 3 of 4 cultured MCC cells derived from the above patients [28]. That result indicates widespread telomerase activation in MCC	 however	 further studies on large cohorts of patients are required to corroborate the finding. Moreover	 it is currently unclear how telomerase is activated and how TERT expression is induced in MCC	 and whether there exists a relationship between TERT expression and clinical-pathological features of MCC. In the present study	 we address these issues by determining TERT expression	 promoter mutation	 gene amplification	 telomerase activity and their clinical-pathological implications in MCC.  Go to: RESULTS Telomerase activation and association with clinical variables were analyzed together with TERT expression	 promoter mutation	 and gene amplification using a series of 43 MCCs from 35 patients (Table (Table11 and Supplementary Table S1) and 6 MCC cell lines.  Table 1 Table 1 Summary of clinical features of 35 MCC patients TERT mRNA expression and telomerase activity in MCC-derived cell lines and tumors from patients with MCC  A previous study reported detectable telomerase activity in tumor biopsies derived from 4 MCC patients [28]	 whereas TERT mRNA expression in MCC has not been investigated so far. Therefore	 we first determined levels of TERT mRNA and/or telomerase activity in 6 MCC cell lines and 43 tumors [33 formalin-fixed	 paraffin-embedded (FFPE) and 15 frozen samples; both FFPE and frozen tumor samples were available from 5 patients] obtained from 35 patients with MCC (Table (Table11 and Supplementary Table S1). Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analyses demonstrated the presence of TERT mRNA at different abundances in all 6 examined MCC cell lines	 and 15/15 frozen and 31/33 FFPE tumor specimens (Fig. 1A	 C and D	 Table Table22 and Supplementary Table S2 and S3). Thus	 a total of 41 tumors derived from 34 MCC patients (34/35	 97%) expressed TERT mRNA. Consistent with TERT expression	 telomerase activity was detected in all 6 cell lines and 11 MCC frozen tumors analyzed (Fig. 1B and E	 Table Table22 and Supplementary Table S2). As expected	 the cell lines exhibited higher telomerase activity than did MCC tumors (Fig. 1B and E	 and Supplementary Table S2). In the activity assay	 telomerase-positive HEK-293 cell-derived extract and its heat-treated counterpart were analyzed in parallel as positive and negative controls	 respectively. In addition	 adjacent normal skin tissues derived from a MCC patient was also included and demonstrated their absence of telomerase activity (data not shown).  Table 2 Table 2 Summary of TERT alterations and telomerase activation in MCC tumors and cell lines Figure 1 Figure 1 TERT mRNA expression and telomerase activity in MCC cell lines and tumors TERT promoter mutations in MCC  The above result reveals a widespread TERT expression and telomerase activation in MCC. Given the recent finding that the UV-related TERT promoter mutation	 up-regulating TERT gene transcription	 widely occurs in malignant melanoma and other skin cancers [16]	 we sought to ask whether this was also the case in MCC. TERT promoter sequencing was performed on 6 MCC cell lines and 43 tumor specimens from 35 patients with MCC. The mutation was found in 1/6 MCC cell lines and 5 tumors (MCCT_2a	 MCCT_2b	 MCCT_17; MCCT_24 and MCCT_29) derived from 4 patients (4/35	 11.4%) (Fig. (Fig.2	2	 Table Table22 and Supplementary Table S1)	 revealing the involvement of this genetic event in the MCC pathogenesis	 although the frequency was lower than that in malignant melanoma. The mutant cell line harbored a C250T. One patient (MCCT_2) had the C250T mutation in the tumors from both diagnosis and recurrence. The three remaining mutation-carrying tumors exhibited C250T	 C228T and CC242-243TT	 respectively. C250T was the major type of TERT promoter mutations identified in MCC	 which is different from most reported malignancies. Of note	 for 3 of 4 mutation-carrying tumors	 the primary tumor was located in the face and the remaining one was at the temple. Both face and temple are UV-exposed areas in the body and there was a significant difference in TERT promoter mutations between tumors at these sun-exposed and other areas (P = 0.035	 Fisherâ€™s exact test).  Figure 2 Figure 2 TERT promoter mutations identified in tumors derived from patients with MCC The TERT gene amplification in MCC tumors  The TERT gene is localized in chromosomal region 5p15.33 whereas gains of this region are prevalent in MCC [12	29	 30]. Because the TERT amplification was previously found in many kinds of cancer [11	 12]	 we examined TERT gene copy numbers in 6 MCC cell lines and 14 patient-derived frozen tumors using qPCR. Patientsâ€™ peripheral blood leukocytes and TERT-amplified HeLa cell line [12] were used as normal (2 copies/cell) and positive (5 copies/cell) controls	 respectively. One of 6 cell lines was found to harbor 5 TERT copies/cell and the remaining 5 lines had normal numbers (Table (Table22 and Supplementary Table S2). Eleven of 14 examined MCC tumors exhibited increased TERT copies ranging from 3 to 12/cell	 whereas 1 of them had only one TERT copy each cell	 indicating its deletion (Supplementary Table S2). Normal TERT copy numbers were observed in 2 tumors (Supplementary Table S2). The presence of TERT amplification was not related to anatomic sites of MCC	 which was different from the TERT promoter mutation.  Correlation between TERT mRNA levels and TERT gene amplification in MCC tumors  To see whether the TERT amplification plays a functional role in TERT mRNA expression	 we made a correlation analysis between the TERT copy number and its mRNA level in 14 tumors. As shown in Fig. Fig.33 and Supplementary Table S2	 higher TERT mRNA expression was significantly correlated with increased TERT copies in primary MCC tumors (r = 0.7419	 P = 0.0024)	 suggesting a positive effect of the TERT amplification on gene transcription.  Figure 3 Figure 3 Positive correlation between TERT copy numbers and TERT mRNA abundance in MCC tumors Relationship of MCV with the TERT promoter mutation	 gene amplification or mRNA expression  MCV is implicated in the pathogenesis of MCC [31]	 and we were thus interested in the relationship between MCV and the TERT promoter mutation and TERT expression. In our cohort	 3/6 (50%) MCC cell lines and 25/35 (71%) MCC tumors were MCV-positive (Table (Table11 and Supplementary Table S1 and S2). The one cell line with TERT promoter mutation was negative for MCV. Three of the 4 mutation-carrying MCC tumors were MCV-negative and one was MCV-positive (Supplementary Table S2 and S3). These results suggest that the TERT promoter mutation tends to occur in MCV-negative MCCs (mutations in MCV+ vs - cases: P = 0.0613	 Fisherâ€™s exact test). When both cell lines and patients were analyzed together	 there was a significant difference in the mutation between tumors with and without MCV (P = 0.011	 Fisherâ€™s exact test). There was no difference in TERT mRNA expression either between MCV+ and â€“ cell lines or patientsâ€™ tumors. We were unable to perform a correlation analysis on MCV status and TERT gene copies due to too few (only one) MCV-negative tumors.  Clinical relevance of the TERT promoter mutation	 gene amplification and mRNA expression in MCC  Age at diagnosis	 gender	 tumor size	 metastasis and recurrence were not associated with the TERT promoter mutation and gene amplification (Supplementary Table S4). However	 higher TERT mRNA expression was more frequently observed in male patients (P = 0.047). In 24 evaluable MCC patients	 lower levels of TERT mRNA expression in tumors were significantly associated with longer overall survival time [P = 0.032	 Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test; Fig. Fig.44].  Figure 4 Figure 4 Significant correlation between the TERT mRNA level and overall survival in MCC patients Go to: DISCUSSION In the present study	 we performed a comprehensive analysis on the genetic regulation of TERT expression and its clinical-pathological association in MCC. Our results demonstrate that (i) TERT expression and telomerase activity is highly prevalent in MCC; (ii) TERT promoter mutations are identified in > 10% of MCC	 and most frequently occur at sun-exposed areas and MCV-negative tumors; (iii) The TERT gene amplification is widespread and positively correlated with TERT expression levels in MCC; and (iv) Higher levels of TERT mRNA expression are significantly associated with shorter survival time in MCC patients. These findings provide important insights into the regulatory mechanism underlying telomerase activation in MCC and may be implicated in future MCC management.  The recurrent TERT promoter mutations create de novo ETS binding motifs	 thereby facilitating the TERT transcription and activating telomerase	 and they have been identified in various types of human malignancies [19]. However	 the mutation frequency varies substantially from cancer to cancer. They are widespread in melanoma	 cutaneous base and squamous cell carcinoma	 bladder and renal pelvic cancer	 hepatocellular carcinoma	 glioblastoma and certain thyroid cancer	 while rare or absent in prostate	 lung	 breast and digestive track cancer	 and hematological malignancies [14-16	 18-21	 23]. In the present study	 we identified the TERT promoter mutation in 1/6 MCC cell lines (16.7%) and 4/35 patients with MCC (11.4%)	 which suggests that it is not a rare genetic event in MCC. All the identified mutations	 including C250T	 C228T and CC242-243TT	 lead to gain-of-function via the creation of an extra ETS binding motif [19]. However	 the mutation profile observed in MCC is very unique. The C250T mutation was predominant in MCC (60%)	 which is in sharp contrast to almost all the reported human malignancies where C228T is much more prevalent [15	16	19	 25]. In addition	 the CC242-243TT mutation	 observed in 1/4 of MCC tumors	 is rarely seen in other types of cancer (<4% and 0.5% in melanoma and bladder cancer	 respectively). It will be interesting to probe what causes such a difference in the TERT promoter mutation pattern between MCC and other human malignancies. It should be pointed out	 however	 that we are unable to exclude potential sampling error and thus the result obtained from this cohort of 35 patients is unlikely conclusive. Further studies recruiting more MCC patients are required to confirm the present finding.  Up to 80% of malignant melanoma harbor TERT promoter mutations and UV irradiation was proposed to result in these mutagenic lesions [15	16	 25]. UV irradiation is also closely associated with the pathogenesis of MCC	 and our findings do support a potential link between the TERT promoter mutation and UV lesions. First	 C to T and especially CC to TT alterations at the TERT promoter	 observed in MCC	 represent the hallmark of UV-induced DNA mutagenesis. Second	 the TERT promoter mutation occurs exclusively in MCC tumors localized at face or temple	 sun-exposed areas. These features were similarly observed in malignant melanoma and other skin cancers [15	16	 25].  Compared to the TERT promoter mutation	 the TERT amplification is more prevalent in MCC. We found that 11 of 14 examined MCC tumors (79%) harbored the increased TERT copy number. This result is consistent with previous cytogenetic and CGH data showing the frequent regional or whole arm gains of 5p where the TERT locus is localized [4	29	 30]. Unlike the promoter mutation	 the TERT amplification occurs in both sun-exposed and other areas	 reflecting its irrelevance with UV irradiation [4	29	 30]. Notably	 there exists a highly positive correlation between the TERT gene copy number and its mRNA level	 which indicates a functional impact of the TERT amplification on the TERT transcription in MCC. Taken together	 the TERT gene amplification plays a significant role in telomerase activation during the development of MCC.  A number of oncogenic viruses target the TERT gene by de-repressing its transcription for telomerase activation [32	 33]. Because MCV is frequently detected in MCC and implicated in the disease pathogenesis	 we are interested in a potential association between the virus infection and TERT promoter mutation or gene amplification. Intriguingly	 the TERT promoter mutation tends to occur in MCV-negative tumors. This is similar to that observed in hepatocellular carcinomas where the TERT promoter mutation is significantly more frequent in patients without hepatitis virus B infection [18]. Owing to the limited number of patients	 the relationship between the virus status and TERT amplification remains to be defined. It is currently unclear whether MCV	 like other viruses	 regulates TERT expression at the transcriptional level. SV40 was shown to activate telomerase in human mesothelial cells via its small T (sT) [34]	 and given a similar sT encoded by MCV	 it could also be the case in the virus-positive MCC. Further experimental studies are required to answer this important question.  Clinical observations suggest that TERT promoter mutations may predict outcomes and associate with aggressive diseases in a number of cancer types [19]. In the present study	 we identified 4 MCC patients with the TERT promoter mutation in their tumors	 and the number is not sufficient to determine its prognostic or clinical power. Further investigations on a larger cohort of patients are required to address this issue. Nevertheless	 a significant association between higher TERT expression and shorter patientsâ€™ survival observed in the present study indicates that TERT may serve as prognostic marker and be a therapeutic target for MCC.  In summary	 the study presented here reveals a widespread TERT expression and telomerase activation in MCC. The TERT gene amplification and promoter mutation may significantly contribute to the de-repression of TERT transcription	 whereas higher levels of TERT expression consequently contribute to poor patientsâ€™ outcomes. Moreover	 given multi-biological activities of TERT/telomerase in cancer development and progression	 [35] and telomerase-based cancer therapy as a novel anti-cancer strategy [26]	 it is worth of determining whether the combination of conventional therapeutic approaches with telomerase inhibitors is capable of improving treatment efficacy and survival in MCC patients.  Go to: MATERIALS AND METHODS Patient specimens and MCC cell lines  A total of 48 tumor specimens from 35 patients with MCC were collected and most of them (33/48) had been described in a recent report [36] (Table (Table11 and Supplementary Table S1). There were 20 female and 15 male patients	 with a median age at diagnosis of 77 years (range 20 to 100). Out of the 48 tumors	 33 were obtained as FFPE samples and 15 were fresh-frozen. For 7 patients	 matched pairs of primary and recurrent tumors were available. All these MCC specimens exhibited high tumor content with >80% tumor cells. The MCC diagnosis was based on histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations. All the patients were followed-up until March 2014 or until death. Detailed clinical and histopathological information is given in Supplementary Table S1. The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee at Karolinska Institutet.  Six MCC cell lines were studied. Three of them were MCV-positive and the remaining 3 were MCV-negative. The MCV-positive cell lines WaGa	 MKL-1 and MKL-2 were kindly provided by Drs. JÃ¼rgen C. Becker (Medical University of Graz	 Graz	 Austria)	 Nancy L. Krett (Northwestern University	 Chicago	 IL) and Roland Houben (University Hospital WÃ¼rzburg	 WÃ¼rzburg	 Germany)	 respectively. The MCV-negative MCC cell lines MCC13	 MCC14/2 and MCC26 were purchased from CellBank Australia (Westmead	 Australia). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% (WaGa	 MKL-1 and MKL-2) or 15% (MCC13	 MCC14/2 and MCC26) fetal bovine serum	 and 2 ml L-glutamine under 37 ÂºC / 95% air / 5% CO2.  DNA extraction	 TERT promoter sequencing and TERT gene copy number determination  Genomic DNA was extracted from FFPE tissues and frozen tumors or cell lines using QIAmp DNA FFPE Tissue kit and Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen	 Hildane	 Germany)	 respectively. The two common mutations C228T and C250T in the TERT proximal promoter correspond to positions 124 and 146 bp upstream of the ATG site	 while the CC242-243TT mutation was at 137 and 138 bp. The target region covering these mutations (from 214 bp to 22 bp upstream of the ATG site) were amplified using conventional PCR followed by Sanger sequencing as described [17]. The PCR was performed with the following primer pairs: 5â€²-CACCCGTCCTGCCCCTTCACCTT-3â€² and 5â€²- GGCTTCCCACGTGCGCAGCAGGA-3â€². The C228T	 CC242-243TT and C250T mutations were verified by sequencing from both directions.  TERT gene copy numbers were quantified using qPCR with the primer pair described above. Î²-globin gene was PCR-amplified in parallel as a reference for normalization	 using the primers 5â€²-TGTGCTGGCCCATCACTTTG-3â€² (forward) and 5â€²-ACCAGCCA-CCACTTTCTGATAGG-3â€² (reverse). TERT copy numbers in peripheral blood DNA (2 copies/cells) from MCC patients or normal individuals and HeLa cells (5 copies/cell)	 well-defined in our previous study	[12] were used as normal and positive controls	 respectively. Two independent assays were performed and the TERT copy number was determined by mean Ct values from two independent assays.  RNA extraction and RT-qPCR for TERT mRNA expression  Total cellular RNA was extracted from frozen and FFPE specimens using mirVana miRNA isolation kit (Life Technology) and modified TriZol method	 respectively [36]. qPCR was carried out using an ABI 7900HT Real time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) and Taq Man Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems) for TERT (Hs00972656_m1)	 ACTB (Hs01060665_g1) and 18S rRNA (Hs99999901_s1). Expression levels of TERT mRNA were calculated from threshold cycle values and normalized to 18S and ACTB values for frozen and FFPE tissues	 respectively.  Telomerase activity assessment  Telomerase activity was determined using a TeloTAGGG Telomerase PCR ELISA kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH	 Mannheim	 Germany). One microgram protein was used in each assay. Reaction mixtures with human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cell protein extracts and their heat-inactivated counterparts were used as positive and negative controls	 respectively. Telomerase activity was calculated from the absorbance at optical density (OD) OD450-OD690 and expressed as the folds of that in HEK-293 cells.  MCV detection  MCV detection was performed using PCR and/or immunohistochemistry [31	 36-38]. The detection of MCV status in all FFPE samples has been previously published [36]	 while all 15 frozen tumors were characterized in this study.  Statistical analyses  The Pearson correlation analysis was used to determine correlation between the TERT gene copy number and mRNA level. High and low TERT expression groups were defined by the median expression levels of the tumors analyzed. Differences in the TERT promoter mutation frequency and TERT mRNA expression between tumors with gender	 clinical stage	 tumor size	 metastasis and MCV status were determined using Fisher's exact test. Overall survival was illustrated by Kaplan-Meier plots	 and significance was calculated by log-rank (Mantel â€“Cox) test. All the tests were two-tailed and computed using Statistica 7.0 software (StatSoft	 Tulsa	 OK). P values of <0.05 were considered as statistically significant.  																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													
7	34||Sequencing studies have identified many recurrent coding mutations in human cancer genes; however	 highly recurrent mutations involving regulatory regions have rarely been observed. Here we describe two independent mutations within the TERT core promoter that	 when taken together	 were observed in 71% (50 of 70) of melanomas and generate de novo consensus ETS binding motifs. Reporter assays showed that these mutations increase transcriptional activity from the TERT promoter by 2â€“4-fold. Examination of cancer cell lines derived from diverse tumor types revealed the same mutations in 16% (24 of 150) of cases	 with preliminary evidence of elevated frequency in bladder and hepatocellular cancer cells. Thus	 somatic mutations in regulatory regions of the genome may represent an important tumorigenic mechanism.  Systematic characterization of human cancer genomes has led to the discovery of a wide range of mutated genes that contribute to tumor development and progression. Most of the somatic mutations in tumors reside within the protein-coding regions of genes or at splice junctions. To determine whether tumor genomes harbor recurrent mutations outside of protein-coding regions	 we systematically queried noncoding somatic mutations using published whole-genome sequencing data.  Analysis of whole-genome sequencing data from malignant melanomas (1	 2) revealed two somatic telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene promoter mutations in 17 of 19 (89%) cases examined. The average sequence coverage at the TERT promoter locus was 30-fold in normal samples and 60-fold in tumor samples (fig. S1A). Each of these promoter mutations resulted in a cytidine-to-thymidine transition at a dipyrimidine motif indicative of ultraviolet (UV) lightâ€“induced damage (chr5	1	295	228 C>T and 1	295	250 C>T; hereafter termed C228T and C250T	 respectively)	 and both mutations localized within 100 base pairs (bp) of the TERT transcriptional start site (TSS) (mean allelic fraction	 0.32; range	 0.07 to 0.55) (table S1). We validated these mutations by means of polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing tumor/normal sample pairs from both the discovery set (Fig. 1A and fig. S1	 B and C) and an extension set of 51 additional melanoma tumor/normal sample pairs. Within this extension set	 33 tumors (65%) harbored one of the mutations. Moreover	 the mutations were mutually exclusive in both the discovery and extension sets (P = 5.4 Ã— 10âˆ’7	 Fisherâ€™s one-sided exact test). Two tumors with a C228T transition also contained an adjacent C>T transition (at position chr5	1	295	229)	 which is indicative of a dinucleotide CC>TT transition. Together	 these TERT promoter mutations were observed in 50 of 70 (71%; 95% confidence interval: 59 to 82%	 Clopper-Pearson method) melanomas examined (Fig. 1B and table S1).  Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Identification of TERT promoter mutations in melanoma and cancer cell lines Both C228T and C250T generated an identical 11-bp nucleotide stretch (5â€²-CCCCTTCCGGG-3â€²) containing a consensus binding site for E-twenty-six (ETS) transcription factors (GGAA	 reverse complement) within the TERT promoter region. Because ETS transcription factors may become activated through dysregulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) signaling	 we hypothesized that these promoter mutations might augment gene expression. To test this hypothesis	 we used a reporter assay system in which the relevant portion of the mutant or wild-type TERT core promoter was cloned upstream of the firefly luciferase gene (2). Here	 we tested both a core promoter fragment (âˆ’132 to +5 relative to the TSS) and the full core promoter (âˆ’200 to +73). In comparison to the wild-type TERT promoter	 both mutations conferred approximately two- to fourfold increased transcriptional activity in five distinct cell line contexts (Fig. 1C and fig. S1D). Thus	 each mutation was capable of augmenting transcriptional activity from the TERT promoter.  To investigate whether similar TERT promoter mutations occur in other cancer types	 we examined sequencing data from this locus in 150 cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) (3). Overall	 24 CCLE lines (16%) contained either C228T or C250T (mean allelic fraction	 0.61; range	 0.17 to 1.00) (table S1). An increased frequency in melanoma was again noted (five of six lines tested)	 with additional evidence suggesting possible heightened prevalence (>25%; one-sided 95% confidence interval) in bladder (three of three lines) and hepatocellular cancer cell lines (four of six lines) (Fig. 1D).  Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that these promoter mutations may function as driver events that contribute to oncogenesis through TERT dysregulation and undergo positive selection	 at least in human melanoma. First	 the TERT promoter mutations showed a combined frequency that exceeded those of BRAF and NRAS mutations	 which activate known melanoma driver oncogenes (4	 5). In an analysis restricted to somatic mutations present at an allelic fraction of 0.2 or greater [to reduce artifacts of mutation calling (1)]	 the four most recurrent melanoma nucleotide substitutions included BRAF [chr7	140	453	136 A>T (V600E)]	 NRAS [chr1	115	256	529 T>C (Q61R)]	 and the TERT core promoter mutations C228T and C250T. Second	 although highly recurrent	 C228T and C250T occurred in a wholly mutually exclusive fashion. This suggests the possibility that the mutations might be functionally redundant. Third	 the absence of other recurrent somatic mutations in the 3 kb upstream of the TERT transcription start site in the queried melanomas (1) coupled with the absence of the described TERT promoter mutations in 24 lung adenocarcinomas with comparably high somatic mutation rates (6) reduces the possibility that these recurrent TERT promoter mutations are solely due to an increased background mutation rate at this locus. Although the role of telomerase in tumorigenesis is well established	 details regarding its dysregulation in cancer cells remain incompletely understood	 particularly in melanoma (7). The TERT promoter mutations identified here may link telomerase gene regulation and tumorigenic activation in this malignancy. The high prevalence of C228T and C250T suggests that these TERT promoter mutations may comprise early genetic events in the genesis of melanoma and other cancer types. Although TERT expression alone is not sufficient to bypass oncogene-induced senescence	 genomic TERT activation may potentiate mechanisms by which melanocytes achieve immortalization in the setting of oncogenic mutations (8). These results therefore suggest that renewed efforts to develop clinically effective telomerase inhibitors may be warranted.  At the same time	 promoter mutations likely represent only one potential mechanism of TERT reactivation in a subset of human cancers. Indeed	 recurrent chromosomal copy gains spanning the TERT locus have been described previously for several cancers	 including melanoma (9	 10).  Highly recurrent somatic mutations within a cancer gene promoter region have not previously been described. Similarly	 the de novo mutational generation of transcription factor binding motifs in tumor genomes was heretofore unknown	 although an ETS transcription factor binding motif was previously associated with a single-nucleotide polymorphism insertion at the MMP-1 locus (11). Together	 these findings raise the possibility that recurrent somatic mutations involving regulatory regions	 in addition to coding sequences	 may represent important driver events in cancer.

We investigated a melanoma-prone family through linkage analysis and high-throughput sequencing and identified a disease-segregating germline mutation in the promoter of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene	 which encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase. The mutation creates a new binding motif for Ets transcription factors and ternary complex factors (TCFs) near the transcription start and	 in reporter gene assays	 caused up to twofold increase in transcription. We then screened the TERT promoter in sporadic melanoma and observed recurrent ultraviolet signature somatic mutations in 125 of 168 (74%) of human cell lines derived from metastatic melanomas	 45 of 53 corresponding metastatic tumor tissues (85%)	 and 25 of 77 (33%) primary melanomas. The majority of those mutations occurred at two positions in the TERT promoter and also generated binding motifs for Ets/TCF transcription factors. The identification of germline mutations that cosegregate with disease in cancerprone families often provides genetic and mechanistic insights into the more common	 sporadically arising cancers. In a study of cutaneous melanoma	 the most malignant skin cancer	 we investigated a large pedigree with 14 related melanoma patients who were not carriers of germline mutations in CDKN2A or CDK4	 two known melanoma genes (Fig. 1). Multipoint linkage analysis showed a possible 2.2-Mb linkage region on chromosome 5p with maximal logarithm of the odds ratio for linkage scores of 2.35 at rs1379917 and 2.45 at rs1968011. Target-enriched high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of the region was carried out on constitutional DNA from the four affected and four unaffected members of the family with an average coverage between 55- and 108-fold (table S1) (1). The HTS data revealed a single promoter variant	 three intronic variants	 and three nongene variants previously unknown and unique to the DNA sequences of the affected individuals (table S2). The disease segregating variants	 seven in total	 were validated by Sanger sequencing of DNA from the individuals sequenced by HTS and of DNA from additional unaffected members of the family. The new variants were also detected in an unaffected member (754	 table S3)	 who was 36 years old and carried multiple nevi. DNA from affected individuals other than those sequenced by HTS was not available for testing. Of the seven unique variants identified	 one variant (T>G)	 was located in the promoter at â€“57 base pairs (bp) from ATG translation start site of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT ) gene. The TERT gene encodes the catalytic reverse transcriptase subunit of telomerase	 the ribonucleoprotein complex that maintains telomere length. The nucleotide change in the sequence CCTGAA>CCGGAA creates a new binding motif for Ets transcription factors	 with a general recognition motif GGA(A/T). Beyond the general motif for Ets transcription factors	 the familial mutation also generates a binding motif	 CCGGAA	 for the ternary complex factors (TCFs) Elk1 and Elk4 (2	 3). To exclude the possibility that the detected promoter mutation in TERT is a common germline variant	 we screened germline DNA from 140 sporadic melanoma cases and 165 healthy controls	 and none carried the variant. Screening of DNA from index cases from 34 Spanish melanoma families also did not show any mutations. No carriers were found in dbSNP and the 1000 Genomes databases (data available for 18 individuals were obtained from Ensembl). The familial mutation in the TERT promoter was in complete allelic linkage with a common polymorphism rs2853669 (G>A) at â€“246 bp upstream from the ATG start site (table S3). In previous work	 this polymorphism was reported to disrupt an Ets binding site	 and it was associated with low telomerase activity in patients with nonâ€“ small cell lung cancer (4). In luciferase reporter gene assays	 we found that the activity of constructs containing the mutation at â€“57 bp of the TERT promoter was increased 1.5-fold and 1.2- fold over the wild-type construct in Ma-Mel-86a and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells	 respectively. A construct with both the TERT mutation and the variant allele of the rs2853669 polymorphism showed a 2.2-fold increase in promoter activity in Ma-Mel-86a and and 1.3-fold increase in HEK293 cells (mean from three measurements; details in supplementary text and fig. S1). The germline occurrence of the promoter mutation	 creating an Ets/TCF motif	 can result in modification of TERT expression in all tissues expressing Ets/TCF. Highest staining for the TCF Elk1 protein has been reported in female-specific tissues	 such as ovary and placenta. The increased expression of TCF Elk1 protein in female-specific tissues may cause gender-related differences in 1 Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology	 German Cancer Research Center	 Im Neuenheimer Feld 580	 69120 Heidelberg	 Germany. 2 Department of Dermatology	 University Hospital Essen	 45122 Essen	 Germany. 3 Institute of Human Genetics	 University of Heidelberg	 69120 Heidelberg	 Germany. 4 Department of Dermatology	 Instituto Valenciano de Oncologia	 Valencia	 Spain. 5 Center for Primary Health Care Research	 Lund University	 MalmÃ¶	 Sweden. *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Two affected members of the family developed several different types of cancer (marked with # in Fig. 1). One affected individual presented with ovarian cancer at age 27 and melanoma at age 30. Another individual was diagnosed with melanoma at age 20; later she developed ovarian cancer	 renal cell carcinoma	 bladder cancer	 mammary carcinoma	 and finally bronchial carcinoma	 leading to her death at age 50. The mutation in the melanoma-prone family prompted us to screen melanoma cell lines derived from sporadic cases of metastatic melanoma. None of the cell lines carried the mutation detected in the family. However	 we identified recurrent ultraviolet (UV)â€“signature mutations in the TERT core promoter in 74% (125 of 168) of the cell lines. The mutations were located within a 49-bp region starting from â€“100 bp upstream of the ATG start site (Table 1	 Fig. 2	 fig. S2	 and table S4). There were two frequent mutations at â€“124 bp (G>A; C>T on opposite strand) and â€“146 bp (G>A); these mutations were mutually exclusive and occurred in 27 and 38% of cell lines	 respectively. Two tandem GG>AA (CC>TT) mutations at positions â€“124/â€“125 bp and â€“138/â€“139 bp were observed at a frequency of 9%. The tandem mutation at positions â€“138/â€“139 bp could also be generated by a single-base mutation at â€“138 bp	 because the base change at â€“139 bp has been reported as a rare polymorphism (rs35550267). The two most frequent single-base mutations as well as the two tandem mutations also result in the creation of Ets/TCF binding motifs. Mutations were confirmed in 45 of 53 (85%) available metastasized tumors corresponding to the cell lines. The somatic nature of the mutations was shown by the absence of mutations in corresponding DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells available from 23 patients. Somatic mutations in the TERT promoter were more frequent than the BRAF mutations (53%	 90 of 169)	 CDKN2A alterations (50%	 84 of 169)	 and NRAS mutations (23%	 38 of 169; fig. S3). The occurrence of concomitant mutations in the TERT promoter and BRAF was more frequent (47%) than by random chance (40%) with an odds ratio (OR) of 3.2 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3 to 8.2]. Concomitant mutations in TERT	 BRAF	 and CDKN2Awere observed in 30% of cell lines compared with the expected frequency of such occurrence of 9% (OR 5.6	 95% CI 2.4 to 13.8). The high recurrence and specificity of the TERT promoter mutations	 together with the preliminary evidence from reporter assays that they have a functional effect on transcription	 suggest that these mutations are driver rather than passenger events. Extensive functional studies will be required to validate this hypothesis. The TERT promoter mutations were also detected in 25 out of 77 (33%) paraffin embedded primary melanoma tumors (Table 1 and table S5) at â€“124 bp (7/77; 9%) and â€“146 bp (5/77; 7%). Four primary tumors carried the GG>AA tandem mutations at â€“124/â€“125 bp	 and eight primary tumors carried the GG>AA tandem mutations at â€“138/â€“139 bp. Reduced sensitivity to detect mutations in paraffin-embedded primary tumors because of contaminating normal cells cannot be ruled out. Primary tumors harbored five additional mutations in the TERT promoter	 which were not present in metastases	 and those did not generate Ets/TCF binding motifs. We also screened DNA extracted from 25 melanocytic nevi and only one carried a mutation at â€“101 bp	 which did not create an Ets/TCF motif. For both primary tumors and melanocytic nevi	 matched normal control DNA was not available for testing. The TERT coding region has been reported to be somatically mutated in 1% of cancers (14 cancer types	 1271 unique samples) (6). Mutations creating Ets/TCF binding motifs in the TERT promoter in melanoma have not been described in earlier sequencing projects. TCFs are a subfamily of Ets transcription factors; two members of this subfamily	 Elk1 and Elk4	 are downstream targets of BRAF and regulate the expression of many genes (7â€“11). Conceivably	 TCF may represent a link between telomerase activity and the frequent BRAF activating mutations in melanoma (fig. S4) (12	 13). Lastly	 whether TERT promoter mutations occur in other cancer types remains to be determined. We did not detect these mutations in a screen of 22 esophageal squamous cell c  Reactivation of telomerase has been implicated in human tumorigenesis	 but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we report the presence of recurrent somatic mutations in the TERT promoter in cancers of the central nervous system (43%)	 bladder (59%)	 thyroid (follicular cell-derived	 10%) and skin (melanoma	 29%). In thyroid cancers	 the presence of TERT promoter mutations (when occurring together with BRAF mutations) is significantly associated with higher TERT mRNA expression	 and in glioblastoma we find a trend for increased telomerase expression in cases harbouring TERT promoter mutations. Both in thyroid cancers and glioblastoma	 TERT promoter mutations are significantly associated with older age of the patients. Our results show that TERT promoter mutations are relatively frequent in specific types of human cancers	 where they lead to enhanced expression of telomerase.

Reactivation or re-expression of telomerase is referred to be a widespread feature in human cancers	 although the genetic basis remains poorly understood in many cancer types. Somatic mutations in the coding region of TERT (human telomerase reverse transcriptase) are infrequent in human tumours	 but germline and somatic mutations in TERT promoter were recently found in a high percentage of human melanomas and human cancer cell lines1	2. Such mutations occurred in two hotspot positions	 located  124 and  146 bp upstream from the ATG start site (  124 G4A and  146 G4A	 C4T on opposite strand) and conferred enhanced TERT promoter activity1	2	 by putatively generating a consensus binding site (GGAA) for ETS transcription factors within the TERT promoter region1	2. Our aim was to investigate whether the aforementioned TERT promoter mutations were present in cancer types other than melanoma	 having for that matter screened 741 primary tumours from the thyroid	 kidney	 bladder	 gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST)	 adrenal medulla (phaeochromocytomas) and central nervous system (CNS). Besides skin melanoma	 we have also included ocular melanoma (not studied in the previous reports)	 benign lesions of the thyroid and skin and 58 human cancer-derived cell lines. Our results highlight TERT promoter mutations as frequent events in specific types of human cancers. Results TERT mutations in tumours and cell lines. Overall	 TERT promoter mutations were found in 142 (19%) human tumour samples (Table 1; Fig. 1a) and 14 (24%) human cell lines (Fig. 1b; Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). The  124-bp mutation was the most frequent	 being present in 99 cases	 whereas the  146- bp mutation was present in 43 cases. The  124 G4A and  146 G4A mutations were found in a mutually exclusive fashion. Two tandem GG4AA mutations at positions  124/  125 and  138/  139 bp were observed in one cell line each (Supplementary Fig. S1 and Supplementary Table S1). TERT promoter mutations were not detected in normal thyroid tissue nor in benign lesions (nevi	 thyroiditis	 goitres and adenomas). No mutations were detected in 26 kidney cancers	 17 phaeochromocytomas and 36 GISTs. TERT mutations in melanoma. We have analysed both skin and ocular melanomas	 a type of melanoma that was not previously studied1	2. TERT mutations were present in 16 out of 56 (29%) skin melanomas	 but absent in the 25 ocular melanomas (Table 1). All the four skin melanoma-derived cell lines but none of the six ocular melanoma-derived cell lines harboured TERT mutations (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table S1). Ten out of 16 (63%) skin melanomas with TERT mutation also harboured the BRAFV600E mutation	 whereas the BRAF mutation was present in 9 out of 38 (24%) melanomas without TERT mutation (P Â¼ 0.01	 Fisherâ€™s exact test	 two-sided) (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Supplementary Table S3). TERT mutations in CNS tumours. In CNS tumours	 TERT promoter mutations were found in 43% (51/118) of all cases with an equal prevalence of both mutations (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S4). The frequency of TERT mutations was different according to the tumour histology and grade (Fig. 1c): although pilocytic astrocytomas (World Health Organization (WHO) grade 1) and diffuse astrocytoma (WHO grade 2) showed a lower frequency of mutations (8% and 15%	 respectively)	 the most aggressive form	 glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; WHO grade 4)	 present the highest frequency of TERT mutations (62%). Oligodendrogliomas (WHO grade 2) and anaplastic oligodendrogliomas (WHO grade 3) also harboured a high frequency of TERT mutations (45% and 54%	 respectively). The presence of TERT mutations was significantly associated with a higher mean age at diagnosis (Supplementary Table S5) in CNS patients as a whole (Po0.0001; Mannâ€“Whitney test	 twotailed) and also in GBM patients only (P Â¼ 0.0247; Mannâ€“ Whitney test	 two-tailed); in oligodendroglioma patients	 we found the same trend	 although not statistically significant (P Â¼ 0.0709; Mannâ€“Whitney test	 two-tailed). In addition	 we observed that	 in a subset of 14 GBM (8 TERT wild-type tumours and 6 TERT-mutated tumours)	 the tumours with TERT mutations showed a trend to increased immunohistochemistry (IHC) expression of telomerase	 although this difference was not statistically significant (P Â¼ 0.4250; Mannâ€“Whitney test	 two-tailed) (Fig. 2). TERT mutations in thyroid cancer. We analysed a large series of follicular cell-derived thyroid samples including normal thyroid (n Â¼ 27)	 benign (n Â¼ 81) and malignant lesions (n Â¼ 263) (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S6). TERT mutations were only detected in malignant tumours (10%) (Fig. 1d)	 namely in Table 1 | Prevalence of TERT promoter recurrent mutations in human cancers.

Within the group of PTC	 TERT mutations were detected to be associated to the so-called conventional PTC (cPTC) (11%).The majority of TERT-mutated thyroid cancers harboured the  124 G4A mutation (22 out of 27 cases) (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Table S7). In thyroid cancer patients	 TERT mutations were significantly associated with guarded prognosis features such as larger tumours (P Â¼ 0.008; Mannâ€“Whitney test	 two-tailed)	 older patients (Po0.0001; Mannâ€“Whitney test	 two-tailed) and male gender (P Â¼ 0.0312; Fisherâ€™s exact test	 two-sided) (Supplementary Table S5).

In bladder cancer	 TERT mutations were frequently detected (48/82; 59%) both in lowgrade tumours (14/21; 67%) and high-grade tumours (34/61; 56%) (Table 1 and Fig. 1e; Supplementary Table S9). The  124 G4A mutation was present in 30 cases	 whereas the  146 G4A was found in 18 cases. No association was found between the presence of the mutation and the age of the patients. No mutations were detected in 26 kidney cancers	 17 phaeochromocytoma and 36 GISTs (Supplementary Tables S10	 S11 and S12	 respectively). Discussion Recent findings have described that TERT promoter mutations arise as a novel mechanism of telomerase reactivation/expression in human cancers1	2. In this work	 we report for the first time the presence of these mutations in different histotypes of thyroid cancer	 and our results validate the findings reported by others in melanoma	 bladder and gliomas1â€“3. Furthermore	 we present for the first time evidence showing that TERT promoter mutations are significantly associated with increased TERT mRNA expression in thyroid cancers. We also found a trend for increased telomerase expression in cases of GBM harbouring TERT promoter mutations. In thyroid cancers	 TERT mRNA was particularly high in cases harbouring both TERT and BRAF mutations. The location of these mutations in the TERT promoter	 rather than the coding region of the gene	 creating additional binding sites for transcription factors	 represents also a novel mechanism of genetic activation in cancer. The frequency of TERT mutations we detected in skin melanomas is similar to that reported by Horn et al.1 in primary melanomas (33%)	 but lower than the frequency found by the same authors in metastatic melanomas (85%) and by Huang et al.2 in a series of 70 melanomas and short-term cultures1	2. In our series	 we have analysed few metastatic melanomas that did not show a significantly higher percentage of TERT mutations. As our series is too small to allow a conclusion	 it remains to be verified if there is an increased frequency of TERT mutations in metastatic melanomas	 as suggested by previous reports1	2. We have confirmed	 in skin melanomas	 the significant association between TERT and BRAF mutations	 as previously advanced by Horn et al.1	 which we now also demonstrate in thyroid cancers. Interestingly	 in benign nevi	 which frequently harbour BRAF mutations	 we did not detect TERT mutations. This finding	 together with the high frequency of TERT mutations in metastatic melanomas1	 suggests that	 although BRAF mutations are thought to be an early event in melanoma genesis	 TERT mutations may occur at a later stage. No TERT promoter mutations were found in ocular melanomas	 which	 at variance with skin melanomas	 harbour GNAQ mutations instead of BRAF mutations4	5. Our results further support the assumption that ocular melanomas result from different etiopathogenic mechanism than skin melanomas5	6. Our data on CNS tumours indicate that TERT promoter mutations are frequent events in gliomas	 particularly in GBM where the highest mutation frequency was found. It has been shown that TERT mutations conferred enhanced TERT promoter activity in vitro1	2; our findings fit with this assumption because we observed that GBM with TERT promoter mutations appear to display increased telomerase expression	 despite the limited sensitivity of IHC and the low number of cases analysed. Our results are also in concordance with those of Lotsch et al.7 who reported that 60% of GBMs were positive for TERT mRNA and telomerase activity7. It will be interesting to assess whether the GBM positive for telomerase activity described by Lotsch et al.7 also harbour TERT promoter mutations. Our findings also indicate that TERT mutations are associated with older patients	 in accordance with a recent report3. The high frequency of TERT mutations in CNS tumours	 particularly in intermediate and high-grade tumours	 opens a window for new approaches in the therapy of CNS tumours. In thyroid cancer	 TERT mutations were only found in follicular cell-derived cancers (PTC	 follicular thyroid carcinoma	 poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma). No mutations were detected in medullary thyroid carcinomas	 as described by Killela et al.3	 nor in normal thyroid and benign lesions	 such as goitre	 adenomas or thyroiditis; this finding fits with previous studies that reported telomerase expression in malignant lesions and not in normal tissue or hyperplastic lesions8	9.

In cPTC	 TERT mutations were associated with BRAF mutation	 highlighting the coexistence of activation of BRAF and TERT	 previously reported in melanoma1 (Supplementary Fig. S2). Our results reinforce the hypothesis of a link between BRAF activation and telomerase expression	 which can be mediated by transcription factors binding to the newly created consensus binding sites	 as previously advanced by Horn et al.1. Both in thyroid carcinoma and melanoma	 it seems that a â€˜backgroundâ€™ status of activated BRAF enhances the effects of TERT promoter mutation. Our results in TERT mRNA expression strengthen this assumption	 showing	 for the first time	 an increased TERT expression in tumours harbouring BRAF and TERT mutation (Fig. 3). Further observational and mechanistic studies are needed to clarify these points. TERT alterations seem to constitute an early and frequent event in bladder cancer. These findings fit with the high prevalence of telomerase activity previously described in bladder tumours10. The recurrent hotspot mutations in TERT were advanced to be	 in melanomas	 induced by ultraviolet radiation2. Bladder is a target for several chemical carcinogens; it remains to be found whether TERT mutations can also result from the action of such agents. The identification of TERT mutations in urine may provide a biomarker for early diagnosis and monitoring of bladder cancer. No TERT mutations were detected in kidney cancers	 nor in 17 phaeochromocytoma and 36 GISTs. The underlying reasons for the tissue specificity of TERT mutations remain to be clarified. We can hypothesize that TERT mutations can be present in two settings. As described by Killela et al.3	 TERT mutations can be relevant in tissues with relative low rates of self-renewal	 which fits with our findings in follicular cell-derived thyroid cancer and gliomas where they are associated with the older age of the patients. On the other hand	 these mutations can also result from environmental factors such as ultraviolet radiation and chemical carcinogens as suggested by their high frequency in melanoma	 bladder and tongue1â€“3. In summary	 our data identify TERT mutations as common events in human cancers and support the assumption that TERT promoter mutations may be one of the mechanisms that underlies telomerase reactivation in several types of human tumours.  Transcriptional reactivation of TERT	 the catalytic subunit of telomerase	 is necessary for cancer progression in about 90% of human cancers. The recent discovery of two prevalent somatic mutationsâ€”C250T and C228Tâ€”in the TERT promoter in various cancers has provided insight into a plausible mechanism of TERT reactivation. Although the two hotspot mutations create a similar binding motif for E-twenty-six (ETS) transcription factors	 we show that they are functionally distinct	 in that the C250T unlike the C228T TERT promoter is driven by non-canonical NF-ÎºB signalling. We demonstrate that binding of ETS to the mutant TERT promoter is insufficient in driving its transcription but this process requires non-canonical NF-ÎºB signalling for stimulus responsiveness	 sustained telomerase activity and hence cancer progression. Our findings highlight a previously unrecognized role of non-canonical NF-ÎºB signalling in tumorigenesis and elucidate a fundamental mechanism for TERT reactivation in cancers	 which if targeted could have immense therapeutic implications.  The telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene encodes the catalytic subunit of the telomerase complex	 which is necessary for subverting the adverse effects of progressive telomere shortening1â€“4. Unlike in stem cells	 telomerase activity is typically low or absent in most somatic cells owing to negligible levels of TERT arising from transcriptional repression of its promoter5. Hence	 reactivation of the TERT gene through transcriptional de-repression of its promoter is the rate-limiting step in reconstituting telomerase activity	 which is an essential prerequisite for the progression of most human cancers6â€“8. Distinct from its role in telomere elongation	 various extra-telomeric functions of TERT critical for cancer development have also been described9â€“12. Clearly	 understanding how the human TERT (hTERTâ€”hereafter referred as TERT) promoter is reactivated in cancers is key to unravelling a fundamental mechanism of cancer progression. Recently	 two mutually exclusive and highly recurrent mutations in the core TERT promoterâ€”C250T or C228T (refs 13	 14)â€”were described	 providing a plausible handle for studying the mechanism of TERT reactivation.  Several transcription factors including Myc	 Î²-catenin and NF-ÎºB have been proposed to be drivers of the TERT promoter	 on the basis of evidence that binding sites for these factors exist on the TERT promoter15	16. NF-ÎºB is a transcription factor well known for regulating many cellular pathways including tumorigenesis17	18. Although NF-ÎºB signalling can regulate TERT expression in vitro9 and two potential NF-ÎºB-binding motifs have been identified within the TERT promoter19	 regulation of TERT by NF-ÎºB in human cancers is not documented. As NF-ÎºB-dependent activation of tumour-promoting pathways has been implicated in the pathogenesis of glioblastoma multiforme20 (GBM)	 the most aggressive form of brain malignancy with high telomerase activity21	 we examined whether NF-ÎºB mediates transcription of TERT in GBM. Surprisingly	 we uncover a NF-ÎºB-binding site in the TERT promoter that specifically maps to one of the two hotspot mutations (C250T or C228T; refs 13	 14) in the core TERT promoter and show that this binding is essential for activation of the mutant TERT promoter. Although enhanced transcriptional activity of the TERT promoter has been correlated with C250T or C228T mutations22â€“24	 the definite mechanism(s) underscoring the induction of TERT transcription by these mutations remain poorly understood. It is not clear whether both mutations lead to activation of the promoter by similar mechanisms. Our data suggest that the two TERT promoter mutations that were predicted to generate the same ETS-binding site are functionally distinct	 in that the C250T unlike the C228T TERT promoter is driven by non-canonical NF-ÎºB signalling. Consistent with literature25	26 that suggests that ETS factors require dimerization with other transcription factors for transactivation	 we find that binding of ETS alone to the C250T mutant TERT promoter is insufficient to activate transcription. Efficient reactivation of TERT at this mutant promoter requires cooperation with p52	 downstream of non-canonical NF-ÎºB signalling.  Go to: RESULTS Non-canonical NF-ÎºB signalling selectively induces TERT expression in C250T-mutant cells  The NF-ÎºB signalling pathway is functionally segregated into canonical and non-canonical arms27. Results from GBM cells stimulated with TNF-Î± and TWEAK (tumour necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis)	 which activate the canonical and non-canonical NF-ÎºB arms respectively	 showed that although TNF-Î± caused a strong induction of NF-ÎºB target genesâ€”IL-8 and I Îº BÎ± in all GBM cell linesâ€”it did not cause changes in TERT expression (Supplementary Fig. 1a). In contrast	 a subset of GBM cell lines exhibited TERT induction following TWEAK exposure (Fig. 1a). Sequencing the TERT promoter region of these cell lines unexpectedly led to a distinct segregation of these lines that induce TERT after TWEAK stimulation	 based on their TERT promoter mutation status (Fig. 1b). Upregulation of TERT in GBM cells containing the C250T mutation correlated with a strong induction of telomerase activity in C250T-mutant cells (Fig. 1c). It is noteworthy that small changes in TERT transcription are sufficient for a significant increase in telomerase activity28	29.  Figure 1 Figure 1 TWEAK-induced non-canonical NF-ÎºB signalling regulates TERT expression and telomerase function in C250T GBM cells. (a) GBM cell lines were treated with TWEAK for one or two days and analysed for TERT expression by qPCR. Plots depict relative fold ... The soluble form of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily member	 tumour necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK)	 at low physiological concentration (10â€“30 ng mlâˆ’1) predominantly activates non-canonical NF-ÎºB signalling through the Fn14 receptor30	31. Activation of the non-canonical NF-ÎºB pathway induces NF-ÎºB-inducing kinase (NIK) to stimulate the processing of NF-ÎºB2 p100 to p52 (ref. 32)	 which forms a heterodimer with RelB	 leading to transcriptional activation of selective NF-ÎºB target genes33	34. GBM cells carrying the C228T mutation did not show induction of TERT or significant differences in telomerase activity following TWEAK stimulation (Fig. 1a	c)	 although these cell lines express similar levels of Fn14 and levels of TWEAK-induced nuclear p52 and RelB accumulation seen were comparable to C250T cells (Supplementary Fig. 1b	c). These results suggest that although similar levels of p52/RelB are activated in all GBM cells	 only the C250T-mutant TERT promoter is responsive to these dimers. Consistent with the induction of TERT transcription and telomerase activity	 C250T-mutant GBM cells exhibited a significant increase in p52 occupancy on the TERT promoter whereas no p52 enrichment was seen in C228T GBM cells (Fig. 1d). Specific enrichment of p52 at the C250T TERT promoter following TWEAK stimulation also led to increased RNA polymerase II (Pol II) recruitment (Fig. 1d). In contrast to the TERT promoter	 TWEAK-induced p52 and Pol II enrichment at a known p52 target gene promoter	 namely BLC (B lymphocyte chemoattractant or CXCL13)	 occurred with similar efficiency in both C250T and C228T GBM lines (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Lentiviral knockdown of p52	 RelB and NIK abolished the induction of TERT in TWEAK-stimulated C250T GBM cells	 verifying that TWEAK-mediated effects on the C250T TERT promoter are specifically mediated through non-canonical NF-ÎºB signalling (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 2b). Association of p65 (RelA) at the TERT promoter was not observed in TWEAK-induced C250T GBM cells (Fig. 1d). Furthermore	 TNF-Î± stimulation failed to recruit p52 to the TERT promoter (Supplementary Fig. 2c) although efficient p65 and Pol II recruitment to the canonical target gene promoter	 NF-Îº B1A	 was observed (Supplementary Fig. 2d).  These observations were also recapitulated when T98G and U251 cells	 containing the C250T and C228T TERT mutations respectively	 were stimulated with agonistic human LTÎ²R antibody	 another ligand that activates non-canonical NF-ÎºB signalling34	35. Although anti-LTÎ²R stimulated a similar pattern of p100 processing to p52 in both cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 3a)	 significant induction of TERT messenger RNA was seen in T98G but not in U251 cells (Supplementary Fig. 3b). These findings corresponded with a significant enrichment of p52 and Pol II at the TERT promoter in T98G cells but not in U251 cells (Supplementary Fig. 3c)	 although similar levels of p52 and Pol II recruitment at the BLC promoter were detected in all cells with anti-LTÎ²R (Supplementary Fig. 3d). Increased occupancy of p52 on the C250T TERT promoter correlated with their enhanced proliferation (Supplementary Fig. 3e) as well as increased telomerase activity after anti-LTÎ²R treatment (Supplementary Fig. 3f). In contrast	 anti-LTÎ²R-treated U251 cells exhibited no difference in proliferation and telomerase activity (Supplementary Fig. 3e	f). Taken together	 these findings suggest that non-canonical NF-ÎºB signalling specifically activates the C250T TERT promoter in human GBM cells.  C250T TERT promoter mutation creates a p52-binding site  NF-ÎºB dimers bind the consensus sequence 5â€²-GGGRN(Y)YYCC-3â€². However	 the nucleotide sequence spanning the C250T mutation site does not form a complete NF-ÎºB consensus motif. Although NF-ÎºB dimers have been observed to bind only one half-site (5â€²-GGGGG-3â€² or 5â€²-GGAA-3â€²) in vitro36	 in vivo half-site binding of NF-ÎºB dimers	 especially p52/RelB	 has not been investigated. We thus examined whether p52 can bind half-site at the C250T TERT promoter using the only available in vivo p52 ChIP-seq data from lymphoblastoid B cells37. Through de novo motif analysis38â€“40	 we identified the palindromic p52 motif from 12	239 p52 ChIP-seq peaks (Fig. 2a) and analysed these binding regions for p52 half-site binding in vivo. The total binding energy (G-score) of the 11-base-pair p52 motif was decomposed into left and right half-site GL and GR (Fig. 2b) and p52 motif enrichment was computed in two-dimensional GLâ€“G space (Fig. 2b)38	41 From this plot	 11 base pairs with high binding affinity (low G-score) were recognized as full-site binding regions and were uniformly distributed along anti-diagonal lines (Fig. 2bâ€”area in triangle)41. In contrast	 11 base pairs with lower full-site binding affinity regions tend to enrich in the half-site binding regions (Fig. 2bâ€”area in rectangles) where only one of the half-site GL or GR is low41. We therefore provide evidence that p52 binds to half-sites in vivo.  Figure 2 Figure 2 C250T TERT promoter mutation creates a p52-binding site. (a) Sequence logo of the p52 motif de novo discovered by TherMos (ref. 38) from the p52 ChIP-seq library37. The 11-base-pair motif is palindromic with the left and right half-sites separated by ... The electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) demonstrated enhanced binding on the DNA probe containing the C250T TERT promoter sequence relative to the wild-type (WT) TERT promoter (Fig. 2c	 lanes 1â€“2) using nuclear extracts from the C250T line T98G. Whereas activation of NF-ÎºB DNA binding to its established consensus motif was dependent on TNF-Î± stimulation (Fig. 2d	 lanes 3â€“4)	 DNA binding to the C250T TERT promoter was unperturbed by TNF-Î± stimulation (Fig. 2d	 lanes 7â€“8). This is consistent with earlier observations that regulation of the C250T TERT promoter is independent of canonical NF-ÎºB signalling. Supershift EMSA with antibodies targeting NF-ÎºB2 (p100/p52) and RelB diminished protein binding to the C250T TERT promoter (Fig. 2e	 lanes 3â€“5). In contrast	 antibodies targeting c-Rel and unspecific IgG did not affect protein binding on the C250T TERT promoter (Fig. 2e	 lanes 6â€“7). To verify the functional implications of p52/RelB binding on the C250T TERT promoter	 we performed short interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments on T98G and U251 cells. Significant downregulation of TERT was observed in T98G cells but not in U251 cells following downregulation of NF-ÎºB2 and RelB (Supplementary Fig. 3g). Enhanced binding to the C250T TERT promoter was observed with TWEAK stimulation (Fig. 2f	 lanes 1â€“2) and this binding was disrupted by antibodies against NF-ÎºB2 (p100/p52) and RelB but not c-Rel and IgG (Fig. 2f	 lanes 3â€“6). RelB does not possess DNA-binding activity as a homodimer but rather mediates its transactivation function by forming a heterodimer with p52 (refs 42	43). Recombinant p52 robustly bound to the C250T TERT promoter in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. 4a	 lanes 4â€“6) whereas GST protein did not (Supplementary Fig. 4a	 lane 7). A DNA probe containing the known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) ÎºB binding sites for p52 (ref. 43) was used a control for p52 binding (Supplementary Fig. 4a	 lanes 2â€“3). Binding of p52 to the C250T TERT promoter was completely abolished when two residues in the rel homology region (RHR) critical for DNA binding were mutated (Supplementary Fig. 4b	 lane 6). Taken together	 these results provide evidence for a p52 binding site on the C250T TERT promoter and demonstrate a previously unrecognized function of non-canonical NF-ÎºB signalling in regulation of TERT transcription.  Non-canonical NF-ÎºB activation enhances tumorigenicity of C250T-mutant GBMs by increasing telomerase activity  NIK is a MAP3K kinase that signals downstream of TWEAK/Fn14 and LtÎ²R to induce phosphorylation of p100 by IÎºB kinase Î± (IKKÎ±)	 leading to p100 ubiquitylation and processing to p52 (refs 33	34). Thus	 NIK overexpression activates the non-canonical NF-ÎºB pathway	 resulting in the generation of mature p52 (ref. 44). Ectopically expressed NIK upregulated TERT expression in T98G cells whereas expression of kinase-inactive mutant NIK (NIK KK) did not (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 5a)	 indicating that NIK-induced processing of p100 was necessary for activation of the C250T TERT promoter. This was consistent with the significant enrichment of p52 and Pol II at the TERT promoter (Supplementary Fig. 5b) and the induction of telomerase activity in NIK-expressing T98G cells (Supplementary Fig. 5c). In contrast	 NIK expression in U251 cells did not affect TERT expression (Fig. 3a)	 telomerase activity (Supplementary Fig. 5c) or recruitment of p52 or Pol II at the TERT promoter (Supplementary Fig. 5b)	 although both complexes were significantly enriched at the BLC promoter (Supplementary Fig. 5d). These findings were consistent with reporter assays using these TERT promoters. Ectopic expression of NIK augmented the transcriptional activity at the C250T TERT promoter-driven but not WT TERT promoter-driven luciferase and this effect was not seen when NIK KK was expressed (Supplementary Fig. 5e). Furthermore	 TWEAK treatment resulted in increased transcriptional activity at the C250T TERT promoter but not the WT TERT promoter (Supplementary Fig. 5f).  Figure 3 Figure 3 Ectopic expression of NIK promotes telomerase function and proliferation of C250T GBM cells. (a) Relative TERT expression was analysed in T98G and U251 cells transfected with vector	 human NIK WT or kinase-inactive mutant NIK (KK) vector constructs. Data ... Ectopic expression of NIK in T98G cells caused increased cell proliferation (Fig. 3b	c)	 which was abolished following treatment with siRNA against TERT (Fig. 3d	e)	 suggesting that the NIK-mediated growth advantage depends on upregulation of TERT and hence telomerase activity. Induction of TERT mRNA and cell proliferation in NIK-expressing C250T cells were abrogated following treatment with siRNA against NF-ÎºB2 and RelB but not RelA	 further suggesting that NIK-regulated activation of the C250T TERT promoter is mediated through the non-canonical NF-ÎºB pathway (Fig. 3f	g and Supplementary Fig. 5g	h). Ectopic expression of NIK (Supplementary Fig. 6a) markedly enhanced in vivo tumour growth of T98G cells (Fig. 4a	b and Supplementary Fig. 6b	c)	 which were previously reported to be non-tumorigenic in immunodeficient mice45. In contrast	 T98G cells expressing vector control or NIK in combination with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting p52 (Supplementary Fig. 6a) were not tumorigenic in vivo (Fig. 4a	b and Supplementary Fig. 6b). Enhanced tumorigenic potential of NIK-expressing T98G cells in NOD-SCID mice was consistent with their increased telomerase activity relative to vector control that was abolished in NIK p52 shRNA cells (Supplementary Fig. 6d). Gliomagenesis and invasiveness of these human cells in orthotopic glioma xenograft models showed accelerated tumour growth in mice that were xenotransplanted with NIK-expressing T98G cells (Fig. 4c). One of three mice implanted with vector T98G cells developed an intracranial tumour	 but all three mice bearing NIK-expressing T98G cells developed gliomas and this increased tumorigenesis was completely abolished by p52 knockdown (Fig. 4c). These observations therefore support the critical role of the non-canonical NF-ÎºB pathway in activating TERT expression and telomerase function through the C250T TERT promoter	 hence potentiating in vivo tumorigenicity. We also analysed NIK and TERT expression levels in primary human tumours derived from GBM patients using immunohistochemical (IHC) staining	 and simultaneously sequenced genomic DNA extracted from the same tumour material for TERT promoter mutations. From the 29 GBM tumours analysed	 28% and 38% of the samples harboured C250T (n=8) and C228T (n=11) TERT mutations respectively	 34% of tumours were WT for the TERT promoter (n=10) (Fig. 4d). Tumours containing TERT promoter mutations exhibited increased TERT expression compared with WT tumours (Fig. 4d). In particular	 C250T-positive tumours had significantly higher TERT expression compared with WT tumours (P=0.0017; t-test	 two-tailed; Fig. 4d). Tumours with the C228T mutation showed a trend of higher TERT levels as compared with WT tumours	 although the difference was not statistically significant (P =0.0859; t-test	 two-tailed; Fig. 4d). Further IHC analysis of these tumours for NIK expression revealed a positive correlation (P =0.028; Linear regression test) between increased NIK expression and high TERT levels particularly in C250T tumours (Fig. 4e	f). This association between elevated NIK levels and TERT overexpression in GBM tumours was not seen in WT tumours or in C228T tumours (Fig. 4e	f). These findings highlight the significant concordance between enhanced NIK expression and increased telomerase expression in GBM tumours carrying the C250T mutation.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Constitutive non-canonical NF-ÎºB activation promotes in vivo tumorigenicity of C250T GBM cells. (a) T98G cells expressing vector	 NIK WT or NIK p52 shRNA were injected subcutaneously into 5 NOD-SCID mice per group. Picture shows tumours isolated ... Targeted reversal of C250T mutation abolishes activation of TERT by p52  To confirm whether p52 binds the C250T loci and no other location on this promoter	 we targeted this mutation site using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to reverse this point mutation to the WT in the genome of T98G cells. Two guide RNAs targeting the TERT promoter were each selected to mediate a single Cas9 endonuclease-induced double-stranded break at either loci adjacent to C250T mutation site (Fig. 5a) and single-stranded oligonucleotides containing the WT TERT promoter sequence were co-transfected into T98G cells to mediate genome editing. We obtained three T98G clones that carried the WT TERT promoter sequenceâ€”two het clones with one copy of the thymine residue repaired to cytosine and one clone with both alleles edited (Fig. 5b). Reversal of the C250T mutation to WT resulted in an appreciable reduction of telomerase activity (Fig. 5c) and proliferation (Fig. 5d	e) of all three WT clones	 relative to a C250T-positive clone that was similarly isolated following the CRISPR/Cas9 screen. Furthermore	 C250T reversal abolished TWEAK-mediated induction of TERT expression (Fig. 5f) and telomerase function (Fig. 5g) in all three WT clones but not the C250T-positive clone	 which retained similar telomerase activity as control T98G cells (Fig. 5c). Consistently	 TWEAK-induced recruitment of p52 and Pol II to the TERT promoter was abrogated following C250T reversal (Fig. 5h) although similar enrichment of the two factors was found at the BLC promoter	 on TWEAK stimulation	 in both the C250T-positive and WT clones (Fig. 5i). These findings therefore reaffirm that this single hotspot mutation generates a binding site for p52 that drives TERT reactivation in GBMs.  Figure 5 Figure 5 CRISPR/Cas9-mediated reversal of the C250T mutation abolishes p52 activation of the TERT promoter. (a) gRNAs targeting the TERT promoter at various loci adjacent to the C250T mutation site were cloned into pSpCas9 (BB) vector and co-transfected with a ... p52 interacts with ETS factors at the C250T TERT promoter to mediate TERT reactivation  The C>T transition is predicted to create a binding motif for the E-twenty-six (ETS) family of transcription factors (GGAA	 opposite strand)13	14. As NF-ÎºB factors have been previously demonstrated to interact with ETS proteins46	47	 we performed immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag beads in T98G cells expressing Flag-tagged p52. p52 co-immunoprecipitated ETS1 and ETS2 in T98G cells (Fig. 6a)	 confirming the physical interaction between p52 and ETS factors. Consistent with this	 ChIP re-ChIP showed ETS1/2 association with p52 at the TERT promoter in T98G cells (Fig. 6b). Furthermore	 knockdown of ETS1/ETS2 or NIK similarly reduced proliferation in C250T-mutant GBM cells (Fig. 6câ€“f). ETS1/ETS2 are known to be auto-inhibited and require cooperative binding with another transcription factor by forming a homodimer25	26 or a heterodimer48 for DNA-binding activities. Our experimental results show that ETS1/2 and p52 co-bind the C250T region but not the C228T region. As both C250T and C228T TERT mutations generate the same ETS consensus motif de novo	 we examined the TERT promoter region spanning both mutation sites for cooperative binding between ETS and p52/RelB to explain the differential response observed. Using TACO to predict co-association of ETSâ€“p52/RelB heterodimers at the chromatin49	 we found all three dimers to be highly enriched in two cell lines (adjusted P value of less than 0.05; Fig. 7a) The consensus of the three dimers 5â€²-nTCCnn(T/A)TCC-3â€² indicates that p52 and ETS1 may form a heterodimer with a 2-base-pair (bp) space. As the p52 half-site motif is very similar to the ETS1 consensus site	 it is not feasible to pinpoint which half-site is bound by p52. However	 it is worth noting that both 5â€²-T1C2C3-3â€² half-sites require a T at position 1 instead of a C. No enrichment of another p52/RelB half-site motif 5â€²-NCCCC-3â€² in the dimers also highlights the importance of T in both half-sites. We therefore aligned the consensus of the enriched dimer to the C250T and C228T regions and found that the C250T region perfectly matches the two â€˜TCCâ€™ half-sites with the correct spacing. In contrast	 the C228T region lacks a T on the right half-site	 which may explain the less favourable binding of the p52/ETS1 heterodimer to the C228T region (Fig. 7a).  Figure 6 Figure 6 ETS factors regulate proliferation of GBM cells and interact with p52 at the C250T TERT promoter. (a) p52 interacts with both ETS1 and ETS2. Lysates of Flagâ€“p52-overexpressing T98G cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag beads and analysed ... Figure 7 Figure 7 p52 cooperates with ETS factors at the C250T TERT promoter. (a) Cooperative binding between p52/RelB and ETS1 predicted by TACO (ref. 49). Top panel: motifs used in TACO. Middle panel: dimer motifs enriched in various cell lines with significant P values. ... To verify cooperative binding between p52 and ETS factors in vitro	 we performed EMSA using recombinant p52 and ETS1 proteins. Whereas p52 bound both the WT and C250T TERT promoters (Fig. 7b	 lanes 1 and 4)	 we found that ETS1 bound specifically to the mutant TERT promoter (Fig. 7b	 lanes 2 and 5)	 which supports current evidence that TERT promoter mutations generate ETS binding sites de novo13	14	50. Our ChIP analysis further confirmed that ETS1 can bind the C250T TERT promoter without stimulation (Fig. 7c). Notably	 addition of p52 and ETS1 proteins to the mutant TERT promoter resulted in enhanced binding of p52/ETS and a complex of higher mobility (Fig. 7b	 lane 6)	 thus validating our bioinformatics prediction. siRNA against ETS1/ETS2 reduced the induction of TERT expression in TWEAK-treated T98G cells (Fig. 7d)	 and decreased p52 and Pol II enrichment at the TERT promoter (Fig. 7e)	 suggesting that ETS1/2 occupancy at the C250T TERT promoter is critical for p52-mediated activation of TERT transcription. Notably	 p52 enrichment at the TERT promoter was completely abolished in T98G cells treated with ETS1 siRNA (Fig. 7e)	 which is probably attributed to the predominant expression of ETS1 and its association with p52 in T98G cells (Fig. 6a; red asterisk). Correspondingly	 the increase in telomerase activity was abrogated in all three TWEAK-induced C250T GBM cell lines that were pre-treated with siRNAs targeting ETS1 or ETS2 (Fig. 7f).  Go to: DISCUSSION We uncover a NF-ÎºB-binding site in the C250T mutant TERT promoter that is essential for its activation. We show that the C250T TERT promoter	 unlike C228T	 is driven by non-canonical NF-ÎºB signalling. Binding of ETS factors to the C250T-mutant TERT promoter in the absence of non-canonical NF-ÎºB signalling is insufficient to activate TERT transcription and efficient reactivation requires cooperation with the p52 subunit of NF-ÎºB	 downstream of non-canonical NF-ÎºB signalling. We also show that ETSâ€“p52 cooperation occurs only in context of the mutant C250T sequence (Fig. 7a	b) and these data explain why TERT is not activated by NF-ÎºB signalling in somatic cells with the WT TERT promoter sequence. On the basis of the results presented	 we propose a model for telomerase reactivation in human cancers harbouring C250T TERT promoter mutations (Fig. 7g). TERT expression is low when ETS1/2 alone is bound at the C250T promoter. On activation of non-canonical NF-ÎºB signalling through exogenous ligands (for example	 TWEAK) or constitutive NIK expression	 p52 is recruited to the C250T promoter and cooperates with ETS factors to drive efficient TERT transcription (Fig. 7g). Enhanced TERT expression promotes telomerase activity	 necessary for cancer progression (Fig. 4aâ€“c). Strong support for this model is provided by the evidence that the C250T mutation site when reversed to WT status by CRISPR/Cas9 loses ETS1/2 binding and p52 is no longer recruited or stabilized at the TERT promoter (Fig. 5h	i)	 resulting in the loss of TERT expression (Fig. 5f)	 telomerase activity (Fig. 5g) and cancer cell growth (Fig. 5d	e). Although recombinant p52 binds in vitro to the WT TERT promoter (Fig. 7b)	 this half-site binding at non-physiological concentrations is not reflective of in vivo interactions as demonstrated by ChIP (Fig. 5h). The non-canonical NF-ÎºB pathway is predominantly known to regulate lymphoid organ development51	 B cell activity and differentiation52	 dendritic cell function53	54	 and bone metabolism34	52. There has been accumulating evidence documenting the involvement of NIK in tumorigenesis of melanoma55	 breast cancer56 and multiple myeloma35	57. The canonical NF-ÎºB pathway has been shown to be associated with progression of many cancers and thought to be required for acquisition of resistance to chemotherapy58â€“61. Unlike the canonical NF-ÎºB activity that is transient62 but strong	 the non-canonical NF-ÎºB signalling is known to be slow but persistent. We reason that given that the TERT promoter needs to be open persistently following reactivation	 tumour cells co-opt to use the non-canonical NF-ÎºB activity (much like it is used in organogenesis) for continued expression of TERT in the proliferating tumour mass. Indeed recent studies have documented increased levels of RelB and NIK in human GBMs (refs 63	64)	 implicating the role of non-canonical NF-ÎºB signalling in GBM survival and tumour progression. We conclude that the non-canonical NF-ÎºB pathway is essential for telomerase reactivation in human cancers harbouring the highly prevalent C250T TERT promoter mutations.  Introduction The telomere sequences at the chromosomal ends	 composed of tandem repeats of TTAGGG	 are protected by a number of molecules that constitute the capping Shelterin complex [1 ;  2]. The incomplete replication due to limitations of the process	 called â€˜end-replication problemâ€™	 results in shortening of telomeres in each successive mitotic cell division that eventually leads to replicative senescence referred to as the â€˜Hayflick limitâ€™ [3; 4 ;  5]. Maintenance of telomere repeat length is dependent on sustained expression of telomerase holoenzyme that adds de novo repeat units at the end of each replication cycle [ 6 ;  7]. Progressive attrition of telomeres is also defined as one of the hallmarks of aging of organisms [ 8 ;  9]. Cancer cells	 characteristically	 acquire infinite capability to divide through maintenance of telomeres by sustained expression of telomerase or in its absence by an alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanism [ 10; 11; 12; 13; 14 ;  15â€¢â€¢].  Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase that together with a RNA component	 TERC	 maintains genomic integrity by telomere elongation [ 16]. Though TERT and TERC are sufficient for in vitro telomerase activity	 the in vivo telomerase functioning requires additional components that associate with TERT and TERC	 to form the holoenzyme [ 17 ;  18]. Those include dyskerin (DKC)	 NOP10 ribonucleoprotein (NOP10)	 GAR1 ribonucleoprotein homolog (yeast) (GAR1)	 NHP2 ribonucleoprotein (NHP2)	 reptin and pontin [ 11; 19; 20; 21 ;  22].  Deregulation of telomerase has been shown to be a ubiquitous feature in human cancers with over 90% of cancers showing an upregulation of the enzyme [11; 23 ;  24]. The telomerase activity is dependent on a number of factors	 regulated at various stages	 which include gene transcription	 mRNA splicing	 maturation and modifications of TERT and TERC	 transport and localization of those components and assembly of active telomerase ribonucleoprotein to telomeres [ 4; 5; 16; 20; 21; 25; 26 ;  27]. The catalytic component TERT acts as a determinant of telomerase activity and its transcription is repressed in most of the somatic cells with the exception of proliferative cells of self-renewing tissues [ 28; 29 ;  30]. An increased expression of TERT has been consistently demonstrated to be a fundamental requirement for cellular transformation [ 4; 31; 32; 33; 34â€¢ ;  35].  The mechanism of TERT upregulation in cancers had been attributed to several mechanisms including epigenetic deregulation as well as genetic amplification of the locus containing TERT gene [ 36 ;  37]. In the absence of any evidence of a definite mechanism	 the telomerase activity in tumor cells has been attributed to the assumption of stem cells being the progenitors in all cancers [38]. The normal stem cells in self-renewing tissues retain telomerase throughout lifetime replication thus abrogating a requirement for a positive selection [6]. The recently discovered TERT promoter mutations add a new dimension to the acquisition of telomerase activity in human cancers. In this review we provide an overview and possible implications of the newly discovered mutations in the promoter of the TERT gene in a wide range of cancers.  Structure and regulation of the TERT promoter The human TERT gene is located on chromosome 5p15.33 and the promoter region of the gene is considered to be the most important regulatory element for telomerase expression. The TERT promoter contains binding motifs for several factors that regulate the gene transcription and distinctly lacks a TATA box or a similar sequence [ 39; 40; 41; 42 ;  43]. The core promoter region consists of 260 base pairs with several transcription-factor binding sites that include E-boxes where c-Myc has been confirmed to bind and activate the transcription [ 44; 45; 46; 47 ;  48]. BRCA1 in conjunction with N-Myc interacting protein (Nmi) forms a complex with c-Myc and inhibits TERT promoter activity	 that property is lost in some mutant forms of BRCA1 [ 49]. Other sequence elements in TERT promoter include GC-boxes	 which are binding sites for zinc finger transcription factor	 Sp1 [ 4 ;  45]. Transcription of the TERT gene is also regulated by various hormones	 cytokines and oncogenes [ 45]. Several repressors of the TERT transcription are also known. p53 has been shown to downregulate TERT transcription in a Sp1-dependent manner [ 50]. Ets transcription factors that comprise over 30 members are prominently associated with telomerase activation [ 42 ;  51]. Ets2 has been shown to form a complex with c-Myc in a breast cancer cell line [ 44 ;  51]. Ets transcription factors are also shown to be stimulated by oncogenes EGF	 Her2/Nez	 Ras and Raf [ 52 ;  53]. The activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressors are known to account for cellular immortalization through induction of TERT transcription [ 54]. The high GC content around the transcription start site of the TERT promoter confers epigenetic regulation through methylation and chromatin remodeling [ 37 ;  55].  TERT promoter mutations in human cancers A discovery of a high-penetrant disease-segregating causal germline mutation in a melanoma family and highly specific and recurrent somatic mutations in tumors from unrelated patients in the TERT promoter has likely provided a definite mechanism for cancer-specific TERT activation [ 56â€¢â€¢ ;  57â€¢â€¢]. Two independent studies using diverse approaches discovered non-coding mutations	 mainly at two residues	 within the core promoter region of the TERT gene. One study was based on the identification of a causal gene mutation in a large melanoma pedigree where affected individuals presented a severe form of the disease with an early age of onset. The linkage analysis identified a 2.2 megabase telomeric region on chromosome 5p that included TERT along with more than 80 other genes [ 56â€¢â€¢]. Sequencing of the entire stretch of DNA region in the family resulted in identification of a disease segregating A > C (T > G) single base change at âˆ’57 bp (Chr 5: 1	295	161 hg19 coordinate) from ATG start site. The germline mutation was present in affected and absent in unaffected individuals in the family with the exception of one. Subsequent screening of cell lines derived from melanoma metastases from unrelated patients led to the detection of recurrent and mutually exclusive somatic mutations at two residues âˆ’124 and âˆ’146 from the ATG start site in the TERT promoter [ 56â€¢â€¢]. Serendipitously	 an independent study using a whole genome sequencing approach also reported the recurrent somatic TERT promoter mutations at the same positions [ 57â€¢â€¢]. Other mutations detected in TERT promoter included the CC > TT tandem mutations at âˆ’124/âˆ’125 and âˆ’138/âˆ’139 bp from ATG start site. The germline and somatic mutations in the non-coding part of the TERT gene were defined by common salient features. One of the underlying features included a de novo creation of CCGGAA/T general binding motifs for E-twenty six/ternary complex factors (Ets/TCF) transcription factors	 which differed from pre-existing GGAA/T Ets binding sites within the TERT promoter ( Figure 1). The somatic mutations at both positions being C > T and the additional detection of CC > TT tandem mutations in a proportion of tumors augmented the evidence for the UV-origin of tumor specific nucleotide changes in melanoma as shown previously in studies based on whole genome sequencing [58â€¢]. Interestingly	 the mutations detected in the TERT promoter in melanoma were more frequent than those in the BRAF gene.  Schematic representation of a part of the TERT promoter that contains residues	 ... Figure 1.  Schematic representation of a part of the TERT promoter that contains residues	 which are affected by a germline mutation in a melanoma family at the position âˆ’57 bp and recurrent somatic mutations at the positions âˆ’124 and âˆ’146 bp from the ATG start site. The mutations create CCGGAA/T binding motif for Ets/TCF transcription factors that results in an increased TERT expression. Pre-existing binding sites for other transcriptions factors are shown above the sequence. Figure options It was also observed that the TERT promoter mutations tend to occur more often than expected by chance in tumors with either BRAF mutations (odds ratio [OR] 3.2	 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3â€“8.2) or with concomitant alterations in both BRAF and CDKN2A (OR 5.6	 95% CI 2.4â€“13.8) [ 56â€¢â€¢]. BRAF mutations	 due to occurrence and role in development of melanocytic nevi	 are considered as the driver genetic lesions in melanoma [ 56â€¢â€¢; 59â€¢ ;  60]. The loss of CDKN2A has been suggested to play a role in the escape of melanocytes from BRAF induced senescence [61]. The acquisition of TERT promoter mutations can be hypothesized to facilitate stabilization of the transformed genome through reversal of telomeric loss. Most melanocytic nevi carry BRAF mutations	 whereas TERT promoter mutations and CDKN2A alterations are detected only in primary melanoma and beyond [ 56â€¢â€¢ ;  62].  Bonafide of newly discovered non-coding mutations in the TERT promoter was established by the detection in cancers other than melanoma [ 63â€¢â€¢]. The frequency of the mutations seems to vary between cancer types (Table 1). The highest frequencies of the TERT promoter mutations have so far been reported	 besides melanoma	 in pleomorphic dermal sarcoma	 myxoid liposarcoma	 glioma	 urothelial cell carcinoma of bladder	 basal and squamous cell carcinoma of skin	 liver cancer and others [ 63â€¢â€¢; 64; 65; 66; 67; 68; 69; 70; 71; 72; 73; 74; 75 ;  76]. The mutations occur in other cancer types as well	 albeit	 at low frequencies [ 63â€¢â€¢ ;  67]. Based on the prevalence in different cancer types it has been hypothesized that the TERT promoter mutations mainly occur in tumors that are derived from tissues with low rates of self-renewal [ 63â€¢â€¢ ;  77]. Unlike melanoma and other skin related malignancies	" no tumor from the cancers affecting internal organs carried CC > TT tandem mutations in the TERT promoter with the exception of that at the positions âˆ’138/âˆ’139 bp from ATG start site in bladder cancer. The tandem mutation reported so far in 4 of the 1231 bladder tumors could also be generated by a single-base mutation at âˆ’138 bp as the base change at âˆ’139 bp has been reported as a rare polymorphism represented by rs35550267 [ 56â€¢â€¢; 65 ;  66]. The differences in mutational pattern in cancer types are known to reflect etiological divergences and the C > T base change in tumors can also be attributed to APOBEC cytidine deaminase expression in cancer development [ 78â€¢â€¢ ;  79â€¢â€¢].

Table options Functional aspects of TERT promoter mutations The high recurrence	 specificity and gain of function support that the non-coding TERT promoter mutations are driver rather than passenger events in cancer development. The functional relevance of the mutations was indicated by the basic reporter assays that showed 2â€“4-fold increased promoter activity [ 56â€¢â€¢; 57â€¢â€¢ ;  80â€¢â€¢]. Tumors from thyroid cancers	 primary glioma	 malignant pleural mesothelioma and liver cancers with TERT promoter mutations were associated with higher gene expression than those without mutations [ 67; 69; 72 ;  74]. Though limited at the moment	 the available data do indicate a tendency of the TERT promoter mutations being present in specific clinical and phenotypic subtypes and appear to be associated with adversarial forms of the disease. While in medulloblastomas the TERT promoter mutations were inversely associated with increased OTX2 expression; in primary adult glioma	 the mutations occurred mainly in conjunction with EGFR amplification [ 69]. Glioma patients with TERT promoter mutations showed an association with poorer survival than patients without mutations; in thyroid cancer	 mutations are reportedly more frequent in advanced thyroid cancers than in papillary thyroid cancers [ 63â€¢â€¢; 70 ;  71].  The studies on bladder cancer consistently showed that TERT promoter mutations are the most frequent lesions with even distribution across all stages and grades [ 65; 66 ;  80â€¢â€¢]. Intriguingly	 an observed interaction has raised a possibility of eventual use of the TERT promoter mutations in conjunction with a common polymorphism within the sequence as biomarkers in bladder cancer. The data from bladder cancer showed that the variant allele of a common polymorphism at âˆ’245 bp from ATG start site in the TERT promoter acts as a modifier of the effect of TERT promoter mutations on patient survival and disease recurrence [ 80â€¢â€¢]. Bladder cancer patients with TERT promoter mutations in tumors showed almost two-fold decreased survival and increased disease recurrence in the absence but not in the presence of the variant allele for the rs2853669 polymorphism [ 80â€¢â€¢]. Mechanistic support for the observation was provided by the fact that mutations result in de novo creation of Ets/TCF binding motifs; the variant allele of the rs2853669 polymorphism	 on the contrary	 disrupts a preexisting non-canonical Ets2 binding site in the proximal region of the TERT promoter	 adjacent to an E-box [ 44].  The occurrence of highly specific TERT promoter mutations indicates a strong selection pressure for the gene over-expression on path to cellular transformation. Increased telomerase production has been demonstrated to promote cancer progression in an animal model [ 81â€¢]. The effect of the promoter mutations on TERT expression can be tenable only in the presence of Ets/TCF transcription factors that can specifically bind to the de novo sites created by the mutations. Some of the Ets/TCF transcription factors are downstream targets of MAPK pathway	 where BRAF is a prominent intermediate [ 82; 83 ;  84]. Whether in melanoma activated BRAF is a driving force in selection of TERT promoter mutations remains to be determined. Nevertheless	 expression of Ets transcription factors is ubiquitous in melanoma and other cancers [ 85 ;  86].  Many studies have stressed the function of the TERT gene beyond its role in maintenance of the telomere; therefore the mutations in the TERT promoter can affect non-canonical processes associated with TERT [ 87; 88; 89; 90 ;  91]. TERT acts as a modulator of Wnt-b-catenin signaling pathway and induces stem cell characteristics in glioma; TERT also regulates expression of NF-kB	 a master regulator of inflammation [ 92â€¢; 93 ;  94]. TERT was shown to be important for proliferation of p53-negative cells through ATR mediated stabilization of ETV1	 which binds downstream of the transcriptional start site [95]. Other non-canonical functions of TERT include enhanced cell proliferation	 decreased apoptosis	 regulation of DNA damage responses	 chromatin state and increased cellular proliferation life span [ 96; 97 ;  98]. The effect of the mutations beyond transcription also remains a probability. The human TERT promoter contains G-rich sequence and has potential for G-quadruplex formation that can potentially be targeted to regulate gene transcription [ 99]. G-quadruplexes have been also implicated in inhibition of telomerase and control of gene expression [100].  Conceptual advancement and therapeutic possibilities The TERT promoter mutations are thought to represent a conceptual advancement in the sense that those instead of altering an encoded protein modulate transcriptional regulation and represent first evidence of driver alterations in so called â€˜dark matterâ€™ of the human genome [ 101â€¢ ;  102]. A host of germline variants discovered through genome wide association studies contribute to the susceptibility of various diseases through transcriptional deregulation [103]. While TERT promoter mutations represent novel findings in human cancer	 alterations in components associated with telomerase assembly	 telomere protection or telomere recruitment are known to impact stem cell function and lifespan in mammals through various disorders [ 104 ;  105].  Several strategies of therapeutic telomerase inhibition including small molecular inhibitors	 immunotherapy	 gene therapy	 telomere and telomerase-proteins in different cancers have entered clinical trial [106]. It will be interesting to see if the TERT promoter mutations	 that increase gene expression	 influence the current on-going research on targeted therapeutics or if the use of telomerase inhibitors in conjunction with kinase inhibitors like vemurafenib or similar small molecules in melanoma can alleviate recurrent resistance [ 107]. Malignant cells	 like all actively growing cells	 must maintain their telomeres	 but genetic mechanisms responsible for telomere maintenance in tumors have only recently been discovered. In particular	 mutations of the telomere binding proteins alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) or death-domain associated protein (DAXX) have been shown to underlie a telomere maintenance mechanism not involving telomerase (alternative lengthening of telomeres)	 and point mutations in the promoter of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene increase telomerase expression and have been shown to occur in melanomas and a small number of other tumors. To further define the tumor types in which this latter mechanism plays a role	 we surveyed 1	230 tumors of 60 different types. We found that tumors could be divided into types with low (<15%) and high (â‰¥15%) frequencies of TERT promoter mutations. The nine TERT-high tumor types almost always originated in tissues with relatively low rates of self renewal	 including melanomas	 liposarcomas	 hepatocellular carcinomas	 urothelial carcinomas	 squamous cell carcinomas of the tongue	 medulloblastomas	 and subtypes of gliomas (including 83% of primary glioblastoma	 the most common brain tumor type). TERT and ATRX mutations were mutually exclusive	 suggesting that these two genetic mechanisms confer equivalent selective growth advantages. In addition to their implications for understanding the relationship between telomeres and tumorigenesis	 TERT mutations provide a biomarker that may be useful for the early detection of urinary tract and liver tumors and aid in the classification and prognostication of brain tumors.  Telomeres are nucleoprotein complexes at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes that are required for chromosomal integrity. Several hundred nucleotides of telomere repeats cap each chromosomal end	 and in the absence of telomerase activity	 telomeres shorten with each cell division (1). Eventually	 uncapped telomeres trigger cell death or senescence. Cancer cells seem to divide ad infinitum and therefore	 require some telomere maintenance mechanism to avoid this fate. Because telomerase activity is generally higher in cancer cells than normal cells	 it was originally believed that telomerase was somehow activated in cancer cells (2â€“6). However	 it was subsequently realized that telomerase was only inactive in terminally differentiated cells and that normal stem cells in self-renewing tissues retained telomerase activity (1	 7â€“9). Because normal stem cells must replicate throughout the long lifetimes of mammals (which can be more than a century in humans)	 it is clear that such cells must also retain telomerase activity. Because normal stem cells are thought to be the progenitors of cancers	 there would be no need to specifically activate telomerase in cancer cells; the enzyme was already active in the precursors	 just as were the hundreds of other enzymes and proteins normally required for cell proliferation.  This view was challenged by the discovery of another mechanism for maintaining telomere length [i.e.	 alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT)] (10â€“12). ALT occurs in the absence of telomerase activity and seems to be dependent on homologous recombination. It occurs in a particularly high fraction of certain tumor types	 such as sarcomas	 pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors	 and brain tumors	 but rarely in most common tumor types	 such as those tumor types of the colon	 breast	 lung	 prostate	 or pancreas (13). Why would cancer cells need ALT if telomerase activity was already constitutively active in their precursors? This question was highlighted by the discovery that many ALT cancers harbor mutations in alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) or death-domain associated protein (DAXX)	 genes encoding proteins that interact with each other at telomeres (10	 11). Presumably	 the absence of functional ATRX/DAXX complexes permits the homologous recombination resulting in ALT. At minimum	 these data were compatible with the ideas that there could be a selective advantage for genetic alterations that results in telomere maintenance and that telomerase is not indefinitely activated in all normal stem cell precursors of cancers.  Another challenge to the idea that genetic alterations were not required for telomerase activation in cancer was raised by the finding that mutations of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter occurred in âˆ¼70% of melanomas and in a small number of tumor cell lines derived from various tissue types (14	 15). Importantly	 only 5 of 110 cell lines derived from lung	 stomach	 ovary	 uterus	 or prostate cancers harbored TERT promoter mutations	 whereas 19 mutations were found among 37 cell lines derived from various other tumor types. This situation is analogous to the situation for ALT	 which is infrequently observed in common epithelial cancers but is observed more regularly in tumors derived from nonepithelial cells	 particularly sarcomas and brain tumors (13).  These findings prompted us to formulate a hypothesis about the mechanisms responsible for telomerase activity in cancers. We suggest that there are two ways to maintain telomere lengths as cells divide: (i) through epigenetic regulation of telomerase activity	 which occurs in stem cells of tissues that are rapidly renewing	 and (ii) through somatic mutations that maintain telomere lengths	 such as mutations in the TERT promoter or mutations in DAXX or ATRX. Those cancers that originate in tissues that are constantly self-renewing	 such as cancers of the epithelia of the gastrointestinal tract and skin or bone marrow	 would be unlikely to harbor telomere-maintaining mutations	 because telomerase is already epigenetically activated in their precursor cells. In contrast	 tumors arising from cells that are not constantly self-renewing	 such as neurons	 glial cells	 fibroblasts	 hepatocytes	 islet cells	 and pancreatic ductal epithelial cells	 might frequently harbor such mutations. A corollary of this hypothesis is that tumor types exhibiting high frequencies of ALT would also exhibit high frequencies of TERT mutations	 and these mutations would be distributed in a mutually exclusive fashion. To test these hypotheses as well as answer other questions related to the role of TERT promoter mutations in various cancer types	 we determined the prevalence of TERT promoter mutations in a large number of tumors.  Go to: RESULTS We attempted to evaluate at least 20 individual specimens of common tumor types and fewer specimens of rare tumor types	 depending on availability of specimens in our laboratories. In those tumor types in which our pilot studies showed a significant number of mutations	 additional tumors were evaluated. Melanomas and tumors of the lung	 stomach	 and esophagus were excluded	 because they had already been adequately evaluated in the seminal papers cited (14	 15). When primary tumors rather than cell lines were used	 we ensured that the fraction of neoplastic cells was >50% through histopathologic examination of frozen sections of the tissue blocks used for DNA purification. In those cases in which the neoplastic content was <50%	 we microdissected the lesions to enrich the neoplastic content to >50%. Primers were designed to amplify the region containing the two TERT mutations that were previously describedâ€”C228T and C250Tâ€”corresponding to the positions 124 and 146 bp	 respectively	 upstream of the TERT ATG start site (14	 15). The PCR fragments were then purified and analyzed by conventional Sanger sequencing.  In all	 we evaluated TERT promoter mutations in 1	230 tumor specimens and identified 231 mutations (18.8%) (Table 1). C228T and C250T mutations accounted for 77.5% and 20.8% of the alterations	 respectively (Dataset S1). Additionally	 we detected four mutations that had not been observed previously: three C228A mutations and one C229A mutation (Dataset S1). All four of these mutations as well as a representative subset of the C228T and C250T mutations (n = 59) were somatic	 as evidenced by their absence in normal tissues of the patients containing the mutations in their tumors.  Table 1. Table 1. Frequency of TERT promoter mutations The 1	230 tumors represented 60 tumor types. In 26 of these tumor types	 at least 15 individual tumors were evaluated (comprising a total of 1	043 individual tumors) (Fig. 1). In the remaining tumor types	 only a small number of samples (2â€“12) was available	 in part because these tumor types are generally uncommon in Western populations (Table 1). Among the tumor types in which at least 15 individual tumors were available for study	 a clear distinction could be made. Eighteen of these tumor types had only occasional TERT promoter mutations (zero to three mutations	 comprising 0â€“15% of the tumors of each type) (Fig. 1). We classified these tumor types as TERT-low (TERT-L)	 because they had a low frequency of TERT promoter mutations. Eight other tumor types were classified as TERT-high (TERT-H) because of their relatively high prevalence of TERT promoter mutations (16â€“83% of the tumors of each type).  Fig. 1. Fig. 1. Frequency of TERT promoter mutations; 15 or more tumors were analyzed in 26 tumor types. Gliomas are divided into primary GBM	 astrocytoma (including astrocytoma grades II and III	 as well as secondary GBM)	 and oligodendroglioma. The TERT-L tumor types included some of the most prevalent cancers	 including epithelial tumors of the breast	 prostate	 thyroid	 pancreas	 gall bladder	 uterus	 and colon (as well as tumors of the lung	 stomach	 and esophagus based on prior studies) (14	 15) and leukemias. In fact	 no TERT mutations were identified in any specimen of 30 tumor types that we studied	 comprising a total of 546 tumors (Table 1). Some nonepithelial cancers	 such as synovial sarcomas	 chordomas	 neuroblastomas	 osteosarcomas	 and ependymomas	 were also TERT-L.  Eight TERT-H tumor types were identified (in addition to the previously described melanomas) (14	 15). These tumors included tumors of the CNS	 transitional cell carcinomas of the urinary tract	 hepatocellular carcinomas	 myxoid liposarcomas	 and oral cavity carcinomas. Although only a small number of TERT-H tumors (other than melanomas) were examined in previous studies (15)	 mutations in gliomas	 hepatocellular	 and oral cavity carcinomas were detected	 which would be expected on the basis of the high frequency of mutation in these tumors types (Table 1).  Clinical and Molecular Correlations in TERT-H Tumors. Sarcomas. One of the highest frequencies of TERT promoter mutation was found in myxoid liposarcoma (19 of 24 tumors	 79% with mutation). Myxoid liposarcomas account for more than one-third of all liposarcomas and âˆ¼10% of all adult soft tissue sarcomas (16). Patients are relatively young	 with a peak age range between 30 and 50 y. At the genetic level	 the most characteristic change is a t(12;16) (q13;p11) chromosomal translocation that results in the fusion of the FUS and DDIT3 genes (16	 17). The cellular origin of these tumors is unknown	 but preadipocytic progenitor cells and mesenchymal stem cells have been implicated (18); after embryogenesis	 the mitotic activity of these cells is thought to be low. Other sarcomas	 also thought to originate from mesenchymal cells that do not self-renew in the absence of damage	 were not TERT-H (Table 1). These sarcomas included synovial sarcomas (0% of 16 tumors) and osteosarcomas (4.3% of 23 tumors). Of note	 myxoid liposarcomas have been previously shown to have a relatively high prevalence of ALT (24% of 38 tumors) (13	 19). The data	 in aggregate	 are compatible with the idea that myxoid liposarcomas almost always genetically activate telomere maintenance genes through either TERT promoter mutations or ALT.  Hepatocellular carcinomas. Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) are the third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide	 and their incidence is increasing in the United States (20). Most HCCs in the United States are associated with Hepatitis B or C Virus infection	 whereas others are associated with alcoholic cirrhosis; 44% of HCC samples that we evaluated harbored TERT promoter mutations (27/61). This finding makes TERT the most commonly mutated gene yet observed in this tumor type (21	 22). The mutations seemed to occur relatively early in tumorigenesis	 because they were observed in 39% of stage I well-differentiated HCCs (Table S1). TERT mutations were observed in virally associated tumors as well as cases without any underlying liver disease at similar frequencies (Table S1). There was also no difference in the prevalence of TERT promoter mutations with respect to sex	 age	 or ethnicity (Table S1). ALT has been observed in 7% of 121 HCCs studied previously (13).  Urinary tract cancers. Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder is the fourth most common type of cancer in American males. In 2013	 over 73	000 patients will be diagnosed with bladder cancer leading to approximately 15	000 deaths in the US alone (23). Two-thirds of the 21 urothelial carcinomas of the bladder that we studied harbored TERT promoter mutations. We were also able to evaluate 19 urothelial carcinomas of the upper urinary tract	 a much less common anatomic site for this histopathologic subtype of tumor. Nine of nineteen upper urinary tract urothelial carcinomas harbored TERT mutations. TERT mutations are	 therefore	 the most frequently mutated genes yet identified in urothelial carcinoma of either the bladder or upper urinary tract (24). The prevalence of ALT in bladder cancers is very low (1% of 188 cancers) (13).  Head and neck cancers. Head and neck cancers are almost always squamous cell carcinomas and can occur throughout the oral cavity lining (mucous membranes of the cheek	 hard and soft palate	 tongue	 supraglottis	 etc.). It is the sixth most common cancer in the world	 and 50	000 cases occurred in the United States in 2012. We identified TERT promoter mutations in 17% of 70 oral cavity cancers that we evaluated. However	 the anatomic distribution of the cases with TERT promoter mutations was striking: 11 of 12 cancers with TERT promoter mutations were in the oral tongue	 although only 23 of 70 total cases originated in the oral tongue (P < 0.0001	 Fisher exact probability test	 two-tailed) (Table S2). The basis for this extraordinary selectivity is curious given the shared characteristics of the squamous epithelium lining the tongue and other parts of the head and neck	 including the oral cavity. Moreover	 we evaluated 22 squamous cell carcinomas of another site (the cervix) and found only one TERT mutation (4.5%) (Table 1). Most cervical squamous cell carcinomas and a subset of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas are caused by human papillomavirus	 which can activate telomerase by expressing E6 and E7 viral oncogenes (25). These findings raise the possibility that human papillomavirus infection and TERT mutation may be alternative mechanisms to activate telomerase among squamous cell carcinomas. We were unable to test correlations between TERT promoter mutations and HPV status or other clinical parameters because of the small number of patients with available data (Table S2). There have been no ALT cases identified among 70 head and neck cancers	 including 41 oral cavity cancers (13).  Medulloblastomas. Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor of childhood (26). TERT mutations occurred in 21% of 91 medulloblastomas that we evaluated. As with the oral cavity cancers	 TERT mutations were not distributed randomly among the medulloblastoma patients. Although medulloblastomas are usually diagnosed at a young age	 those medulloblastomas with TERT mutations were diagnosed at a considerably older age (median = 6 vs. 16 y	 P = 0.0012	 t test assuming unequal variances	 two-tailed) (Fig. S1A). This observation has important implications for understanding the basis for the selectivity of the tumor types harboring TERT promoter mutations (Discussion); 45 of 90 patients had been assessed previously for orthodenticle homeobox 2 (OTX2) gene amplification and expression	 and alterations in this transcription factor are known to correlate with clinically distinct molecular subtypes of medulloblastoma (27). OTX2 expression was >100-fold higher in medulloblastoma patients without TERT promoter mutations than in those patients with TERT promoter mutations (note the log scale in Fig. S1B). The high levels of OTX2 expression were usually the result of OTX2 gene amplification (Fig. S1C). The association of TERT promoter mutations with an older age at diagnosis and a lack of OTX2 overexpression raises the possibility that TERT mutations occur in a specific clinical and molecular subtype of medulloblastoma. The most likely molecular subtype of medulloblastoma that may be enriched for TERT mutations is the noninfant sonic hedgehog subtype	 which is characterized by an older age at diagnosis and lower expression of OTX2 (28	 29). Larger studies will be needed to make this association more definitive. ALT has been observed in 7% of 55 medulloblastomas studied previously (13).  Gliomas. Gliomas are the most common CNS tumor type and accounted for >14	000 deaths in the United States last year (30). Histopathological and clinical criteria established by the World Health Organization are used to characterize these tumors into several subtypes (30). We considered the four main subtypes individually (Table S3).  Primary glioblastoma. These primary glioblastomas (GBMs) are the most common malignant brain tumors in adults	 accounting for âˆ¼17% of all intracranial tumors	 and they confer the worst survival (median of âˆ¼15 mo) (31). These high-grade (grade IV) tumors have no detectable precursor lesions and have been referred to as de novo tumors. The prevalence of TERT promoter mutations was remarkably high in GBMs of adults (83% of 78 tumors) (Table S3). This prevalence is higher than the prevalence of any other genetic mutation in this tumor type (32). These findings provide a molecular mechanism responsible for the high levels of TERT mRNA and telomerase activity observed in GBMs (33).  For 51 of 78 primary GBM tumors	 data on other common genetic alterations as well as clinical data were available (Fig. 2A). Interestingly	 EGFR amplification	 a classic molecular feature of primary GBM	 exclusively occurred in tumors with TERT mutations (P = 0.0006	 Fisher exact probability test	 two-tailed). Conversely	 no association was identified between TERT mutation and either TP53 mutation or CDKN2A deletion. Importantly	 the frequency of TERT promoter mutations was considerably less in primary GBMs of pediatric patients (11% of 19 tumors) than adult patients (Discussion) (Table S3). ALT was observed in 11% of 105 adult GBM and 44% of pediatric GBM (i.e.	 the reverse of the pattern observed for TERT promoter mutations) (13). Primary GBM patients without TERT mutations survived considerably longer	 on average	 than patients with such mutations (median = 27 vs. 14 mo	 P = 0.01 by the log rank test) (Fig. S3).  Fig. 2. Fig. 2. Mutations of selected genes in glioma subtypes. (A) Distribution of TERT mutations and other genetic events in 51 primary GBMs. (B) Distribution of TERT mutations and other genetic events among 40 astrocytomas	 including grades IIâ€“III astrocytomas ... Astrocytomas. Infiltrative astrocytic tumors frequently progress	 with recurrent lesions often of higher grade than the original lesions excised at surgery. They are most often grade II or III but can progress to grade IV (at which point they are often termed secondary GBMs). Astrocytomas of any stage rarely contained TERT promoter mutations (10% of 40 total samples) (Table S3). Instead	 they more frequently contained isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) or isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) mutations (75% of 40 tumors)	 ATRX mutations (70% of 40 tumors)	 and TP53 mutations (73% of 40 tumors) (Fig. 2B). ALT has been observed in 63% of 57 astrocytomas	 consistent with the high prevalence of ATRX mutations (13). The lack of activating TERT mutations in IDH1 mutant tumors is also corroborated by the lack of TERT mRNA and telomerase activity observed in these lesions (33).  Oligodendrogliomas. Like astrocytomas	 oligodendrogliomas often progress	 and they frequently contain TERT promoter mutations (78% of 45 tumor samples) (Table S3). Oligodendroglioma was the only tumor type studied (of all types	 including non-CNS tumors) (Dataset S1) in which C250T mutations were nearly as frequent as C228T mutations. In oligodendrogliomas	 43% of tumors with TERT mutations contained C250T substitutions	 whereas in other gliomas	 only 10% did (P < 0.001	 Fisher exact probability test	 two-tailed). Interestingly	 91% of 45 oligodendrogliomas that were evaluated for ATRX and TERT sequence alterations contained either an ATRX coding or a TERT promoter mutation	 suggesting that genetic alterations resulting in telomere maintenance are required for tumorigenesis of this subtype.  Oligodendrogliomas have long been known to contain characteristic losses of chromosome arms 1p and 19q	 and these losses reflect inactivation of the CIC gene on chromosome 19q and in some cases	 inactivation of the FUBP1 gene on chromosome 1p (34â€“36). Accordingly	 78% of 45 oligodendrogliomas contained chromosome arm 1p or 19q losses of heterozygosity (Fig. 2C) (34â€“36). Moreover	 nearly all of them contained IDH1 or IDH2 mutations (93%).  Oligoastrocytomas. As their name implies	 these tumors are mixed	 with histologic features of both oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas. This mixture	 in part	 reflects the difficulties in distinguishing the various glioma subtypes from one another on the basis of histopathologic or clinical criteria (37). The genetic features of this tumor subtype reflect this mixture: the prevalence of TERT promoter mutations (25% of 24 tumors) was intermediate between oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas	 as were the frequencies of chromosome (Chr) 1p/19q losses and IDH1/2	 TP53	 and ATRX mutations (Fig. 2D).  ALT Vs. TERT. ALT has been observed in tumors of the CNS (particularly gliomas) more frequently than tumors of any other tissue type. Given that TERT promoter mutations are also common in gliomas	 the relationship between these two features could be determined with high confidence. The tumors depicted in Fig. 2 had previously been evaluated for alterations in ATRX	 which is a nearly perfect surrogate for the ALT phenotype (11	 37). Our data show that there were 50 gliomas with ATRX mutations and 83 gliomas with TERT mutations; 0 of 83 tumors with TERT mutations contained ATRX mutations (P < 0.0001	 Fisher exact probability test	 two-tailed).  Go to: DISCUSSION The results described above	 as well as the results published in refs. 14 and 15	 provide evidence that supports one of the hypotheses raised in the Introduction and refutes others. The first of these hypotheses was that TERT mutations would only be observed in tumors derived from tissues that are not constantly self-renewing under normal circumstances. This hypothesis was supported in part: the vast majority of TERT promoter mutations occurred in tumors derived from tissues that do not continually self-renew. The TERT-H tumor types include only melanomas	 certain subtypes of glioma	 medulloblastomas	 squamous cell cancers of the tongue	 liposarcomas	 HCCs	 and urinary tract cancers. The normal transitional cells of the urinary tract have very low proliferative indices (0.64% Â± 0.52%)	 much lower than indices of gastrointestinal tract	 bone marrow	 or skin (38). Normal hepatocytes also do not turnover often (39)	 and glial cells are thought to have limited capacity for self-renewal (40).  Two other observations also support the hypothesis. Pediatric primary GBMs rarely contained TERT mutations (11%)	 whereas adult primary GBMs frequently did (83%). Pediatric GBMs are presumably derived from cells that are still dividing at the time of tumor initiation	 and therefore	 there is no selective advantage conferred by activating telomerase through a genetic mutation. Adult GBMs	 in contrast	 are presumably derived from postmitotic cells	 and they should require telomerase activation. Similarly	 medulloblastomas are embryonal tumors that typically arise from precursor cells with high self-renewal rates that do not usually persist in adults. This finding is consistent with our observation that the mean age of medulloblastoma patients with TERT mutations was considerably older than the mean age of medulloblastoma patients without TERT mutations (Fig. S1A).  There are	 however	 exceptions that belie the hypothesis that TERT mutations occur only in nonâ€“self-renewing tissues. The epithelium that lines the tongue constantly self-renews	 but many squamous carcinomas of the tongue harbored TERT mutations (Table S2). Additionally	 the squamous epithelia of the tongue certainly would not be expected to self-renew less than other squamous epithelia of the oral cavity	 but the latter rarely harbored TERT mutations (Table S2). This finding may suggest that squamous carcinomas of the tongue originate from a different cell of origin than other oral cavity squamous carcinomas. Conversely	 only a subset of the tumor types derived from nonâ€“self-renewing tissues was TERT-H. For example	 the TERT-H tumors included myxoid liposarcomas but not synovial sarcomas. Moreover	 cells of the pancreas (the islets of Langerhans and the ductal epithelial cells) rarely renew	 but pancreatic tumors of all types (pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors	 acinar carcinomas	 and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas) were all TERT-L. The most that we can conclude at present is that nonâ€“self-renewing cell types are the major sources of TERT-H tumors but that nonâ€“self-renewal is only one of the factors that determines whether tumor cells with TERT promoter mutations will have a selective growth advantage over adjoining cells.  The first corollary to the hypothesis raised in the Introduction was that tumor types that displayed ALT would be those types that harbored TERT promoter mutations. This corollary is soundly refuted by these data	 at least in general terms. Although tumor types of the CNS and liposarcomas had high frequencies of ALT as well as high frequencies of TERT promoter mutations	 these tumor types were the exceptions rather than the rule. For example	 pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors have very high frequencies of ALT but no evidence of TERT mutations. Conversely	 bladder cancers frequently have TERT mutations but never have ALT (13). Additionally	 even among gliomas	 pediatric GBMs have high frequencies of ALT and low frequencies of TERT mutations	 whereas adult GBMs have the reverse pattern.  The second corollary was that the selective advantage afforded by TERT mutation would be equivalent to the advantage afforded by ATRX mutation (conferring ALT). This hypothesis was most effectively tested in gliomas	 in which both ATRX coding and TERT promoter mutations were common. There was a striking mutual exclusivity with respect to ATRX and TERT mutations (P < 0.0001)	 lending strong support to this idea.  These results also raise many unanswered questions. In some tumor types	 such as gliomas	 we can imagine that all tumors have genetically activated telomere maintenance programs through mutations in either TERT or ATRX. However	 in other tumor types with frequent ATRX mutations	 such as pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors	 what is responsible for activating telomerase in the fraction of cases not exhibiting ALT if it is not a mutation in the TERT promoter? Similarly	 what is responsible for activating telomerase in those tumors derived from nonâ€“self-renewing cell types in which neither ALT nor TERT mutations is frequently observed	 such as synovial sarcomas or osteosarcomas? Also	 there are occasional individual tumors among the TERT-L types that have TERT promoter mutations (e.g.	 cervical cancers	 ovarian cancers	 and in ref. 15	 lung cancers). What distinguishes these occasional cancers from others of the same histopathologic subtype? Whole-genome sequencing studies	 rather than those studies limited to the exome	 might provide answers to these questions.  The results recorded here have practical as well as basic scientific implications. Two-thirds of bladder cancers had TERT promoter mutations	 making it the most commonly mutated gene yet identified in invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. Given the persistently high mortality rate despite multimodality treatment in this group of patients	 these mutations represent ideal urinary biomarkers to detect bladder cancers at an early stage and to follow patients for evidence of progression or recurrence once they have been diagnosed (41). Similarly	 the high prevalence of TERT promoter mutations in HCCs and glioma subtypes provides excellent candidate biomarkers for early detection (HCC) or monitoring (HCC in the plasma and gliomas in the cerebrospinal fluid) (42	 43).  Another practical implication involves diagnostics. We conjecture that tumors with TERT promoter or ATRX mutations are derived from different precursor cells and that either type of precursor cell is different from those types that are the precursors of tumors without such mutations. This distinction could aid classification of the tumors in clinically meaningful ways. For example	 Fig. 2 and Fig. S2 outline the major genetic alterations occurring in the three most common types of gliomas. On the basis of the data in Fig. 2 Aâ€“C	 we speculate that oligodendrogliomas that lack TERT mutations but contain ATRX mutations may behave more like astrocytomas than oligodendrogliomas and vice versa. Similarly	 the primary GBMs without TERT mutations (15% of the total) may behave more like advanced progressive astrocytomas	 which generally lack TERT mutations. This possibility is supported by the observation that those primary GBM patients without TERT mutations had a longer survival	 on average	 than other primary GBM patients (Fig. S3).  Go to: METHODS All clinical information and tissue were obtained with consent and Institutional Review Board approval from the various institutions donating material to this study	 and they were obtained in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Tissue sections were reviewed by board-certified pathologists to ensure that â‰¥50% of the cells used for DNA purification were neoplastic and confirm histopathological diagnosis. Oligonucleotides with the sequences 5â€²-M13-GGCCGATTCGACCTCTCT-3â€² and 5â€²-AGCACCTCGCGGTAGTGG-3â€²	 where M13 is a universal sequencing priming site with sequence 5â€²-tgtaaaacgacggccagt-3â€²	 were used to PCR-amplify the proximal TERT promoter containing C228 and C250 (chr5: 1	295	228; chr5: 1	295	250	 respectively; hg19) for Sanger sequencing using standard methods (44). Primary GBM copy number data as well as ALT status were derived from the data published in refs. 37	45	 and 46	 and OTX2 copy number expression was derived from the data published in ref. 27. Brain tumor patients were treated at the Tisch Brain Tumor Center at Duke. For the purposes of this study	 secondary GBM designates a GBM that was resected >1 y after a prior diagnosis of a lower-grade glioma (grades Iâ€“III)	 and all other GBMs were considered to be primary GBMs. Pediatric GBM samples were defined as those samples occurring before 21 y of age.   																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
4	35|| Abstract  DICER1 plays a critical role in microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis. Recurrent somatic 'hotspot' mutations at the four metal-binding sites within the RNase IIIb domain of DICER1 were identified in ovarian sex cord-stromal tumours and have since been described in other paediatric tumours. In this study	 we screened the RNase IIIb domain of DICER1 in 290 endometrial tumours and identified six cases with hotspot mutations	 including two cases affected by an atypical G1809R mutation directly adjacent to a metal-binding site. Using Illumina and Sanger targeted resequencing	 we observed and validated biallelic DICER1 mutations in several cases with hotspot mutations. Through in vitro DICER1 cleavage assays	 small RNA deep sequencing and real-time PCR	 we demonstrated that mutations adding a positively charged side chain to residue 1809 have similar detrimental effects on 5p miRNA production to mutations at the metal-binding sites. As expected	 5p miRNAs were globally reduced in tumours and cell lines with hotspot mutations. Pathway analysis of gene expression profiles indicated that genes de-repressed due to loss of 5p miRNAs are strongly associated with pathways regulating the cell cycle. Using a Dicer1-null mouse cell line model	 we found that expression of DICER1 hotspot mutants promoted cell proliferation	 whereas wild-type (WT) DICER1 inhibited cell proliferation. Furthermore	 targets of let-7 family miRNAs are enriched among the up-regulated genes	 suggesting that loss of let-7 may be impacting downstream pathways. Our results reveal that DICER1 hotspot mutations are implicated in common malignancies and may constitute a unique oncogenic pathway.

Introduction  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are âˆ¼22 nucleotide (nt)	 single-stranded	 non-coding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression in animals and plants [1]. miRNAs play crucial roles in maintaining normal cellular functions	 such as differentiation	 proliferation and apoptosis [2]. The biogenesis of miRNAs starts with the transcription of long primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs)	 which are then processed into âˆ¼70â€‰nt hairpin precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) by the endoribonuclease Drosha. Pre-miRNAs are subsequently transported to the cytoplasm by Exportin 5 (XPO5)	 where they are further trimmed by DICER1	 another endoribonuclease. The two RNase III domains of DICER1	 which form an intramolecular dimer	 cleave the pre-miRNA hairpin to generate miRNA duplexes composed of 5p and 3p miRNAs that emanate from the 5â€² and 3â€² arms	 respectively	 of the hairpin [3	 4]. The 'guide strand' will be preferentially incorporated into an miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC) and interacts with target mRNAs	 whereas the 'passenger strand' is often degraded. Since a single defect in the components of the miRNA biogenesis pathway could potentially affect the entire miRNA population	 it is not surprising that disruptions of this pathway are associated with a variety of human malignancies [5].  DICER1 germline mutations are known to predispose carriers to cancer [5]	 such as familial pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB) [6]. Furthermore	 heterozygous germline DICER1 mutations have been identified in PPB-related familial tumourâ€“dysplasia syndrome (PPBâ€“FTDS)	 multinodular goitre (MNG)	 Sertoliâ€“Leydig cell tumour (SLCT)	 cystic nephroma (CN)	 Wilms' tumour	 cervical embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (cERM) and pineoblastoma [7-10]. We recently identified recurrent somatic DICER1 hotspot mutations in rare non-epithelial ovarian tumours [11]. Subsequent studies have shown that hotspot mutations at the four metal-binding sites in the RNase IIIb domain (E1705	 D1709	 D1810 and E1813) impair DICER1's ability to generate mature 5p miRNAs [4	11	 12]. More recently	 DICER1 hotspot mutations were identified in tumours from PPB and PPBâ€“FTDS cases possessing germline DICER1 mutations	 suggesting a two-hit hypothesis of tumourigenesis [11	 13-16].  The mutational analyses of DICER1 have previously focused on rare paediatric cancers [6-11	 13-16]. In this study	 we investigated the prevalence of DICER1 mutations in a spectrum of more common malignancies. We screened for DICER1 hotspot mutations in 290 endometrial tumours	 and evaluated the two-hit hypothesis in cases with hotspot mutations. We identified an atypical hotspot mutation	 G1809R	 which is immediately adjacent to the metal-binding residue D1810	 and characterized its functional impact on miRNAs and downstream signalling pathways. Using a Dicer1-null mouse fallopian tube carcinoma-derived cell line [17]	 we demonstrated that DICER1 hotspot mutations abolish the inhibitory effects of DICER1 on cell proliferation. Our data also suggested that loss of let-7 family miRNAs may contribute to the oncogenic properties of DICER1 hotspot mutations. Materials and methods  Patient samples and cell culture  All the patient tumour and blood samples were collected from the Ovarian Cancer Research Programme (OvCaRe) tissue bank (Vancouver	 British Columbia	 Canada) under ethical approvals from the University of British Columbia and BC Cancer Agency Research Ethics Board [11].  DKO172 cells	 derived from a Dicer1/Pten double-knockout mouse fallopian tube tumour model [17]	 were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/F12 (Hyclone) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37â€‰Â°C and 5% CO2. DNA and RNA extraction  DNA was extracted using DNeasy Blood & Tissue or QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kits (Qiagen)	 and RNA was extracted using miRNeasy or miRNeasy FFPE kits (Qiagen)	 according to the manufacturer's protocols. PCR and Sanger sequencing  Primer sets and the protocol used to sequence the RNase IIIb domain of DICER1 have been described in previous studies [11	 18]. Primer sets for DICER1 cDNA sequencing are listed in Table S2 (see supplementary material). PCR products were sequenced on an ABI Prism 3130xl Genetic Analyser (Applied Biosystems) and visualized using 4peaks (Mek&Tosj).  To determine whether two DICER1 mutations from the same sample are in trans or in cis	 a single amplicon encompassing two mutations was amplified and cloned into pCR2.1	 using a TOPO TA-Cloning Kit (Life Technologies). Ten colonies of each sample were Sanger sequenced for both hotspot and non-hotspot mutations. Targeted DICER1 amplicon resequencing  The sequencing protocol was adopted from Forshew et al [19]. Target-specific amplification was performed on a microfluidic system using the 48.48 Access Array Integrated Fluidic Circuit	 following the manufacturer's user guide (Fluidigm; for more information	 see supplementary material	 Supplementary materials and methods and Table S3). Small RNA sequencing  Total RNA was quantified using the QubitÂ® RNA BR Assay Kit (Life Technologies) and diluted to 200â€‰ng/ Î¼l. Small RNA libraries were prepared using the TruSeq Small RNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina)	 according to the manufacturer's instructions (for more information	 see supplementary material	 Supplementary materials and methods). Plasmid construction  A series of DICER1 mutants were generated from pDONR221-wild-type DICER1 (WT) [4] by site-directed mutagenesis (Agilent) and shuttled into pLD-hygro-EnVM vector [20] through Gateway LR-clonase reaction (Invitrogen). Sanger sequencing verified the DICER1 mutations in the vectors. GFP-expressing vectors were used as the vector controls. Western blotting  Cell lysates (30â€‰ Î¼g) were separated on 8% sodium dodecyl sulphateâ€“polyacrylamide gels (SDSâ€“PAGE) and then were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The DICER1 antibody (Santa Cruz	 sc-30226) was used to detect both mouse and human DICER1 forms. Vinculin (Sigma	 V9131) was used as the loading control. DICER1 in vitro cleavage assay  Pre-let-7c miRNA was generated by in vitro transcription of a DNA template oligo (5â€²-GGAAAGCTAGAAGGTTGTACAGTTAACTCCCAGGGTGTAACTCTAAACCATACAACCTACTACCTCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTACAT-3â€²) annealed to the 5â€²-ATGTAATACGAC TCACTATAG-3â€² oligo using the MEGAscript Â® T7 Transcription Kit (Invitrogen). The RNA transcript was gel-purified and 5â€²-32P end-labelled. The preparation of DICER1 enzymes and in vitro DICER cleavage assays were performed as previously described [11]. The resulting products were visualized on a storage phosphor screen	 using a FLA-7000 instrument (GE Healthcare). miRNA and mRNA real-time PCR  The expression of individual miRNAs was quantified using the miRCURY LNA Universal RT microRNA PCR system (Exiqon)	 in triplicate	 following the manufacturer's instructions. The endogenous small nuclear RNA RNU1A1 was used for normalization. The expression of mRNA transcripts was determined using cDNA converted from total RNA	 followed by real-time PCR with Power SYBR Â® Green Master Mix (Life Technologies) [4]. The mouse housekeeping gene Actb was used for normalization. The relative levels were calculated using the Î”Î”Ct method [21]. Cell growth and gene expression analysis  DKO172 cells were transfected with 2â€‰ Î¼g pLD-hygro-EnVM vectors expressing WT DICER1	 D1709N	 G1809R or GFP	 using the TransIT Â®-LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus)	 followed by selection in 300â€‰ Î¼g/ml hygromycin for 84â€‰h. Cells were then harvested for RNA extraction or replated in 96-well plates at 2000 cells/well. Cell growth was monitored by the IncuCyte ZOOM Live Content Imaging System (Essen BioScience). The gene expression profiles were determined using the Agilent SurePrint G3 mouse gene expression microarrays	 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Array data were filtered	 normalized	 analysed and visualized by GeneSpring GX (v. 12	 Agilent). Raw data can be accessed via NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE65092). Results  DICER1 hotspot mutations in endometrial tumours  To evaluate the prevalence of DICER1 mutations in common malignancies	 we examined the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cBioPortal database (http://www.cbioportal.org) and discovered that endometrial carcinomas have the highest frequency of DICER1 mutations (see supplementary material	 Figure S1) [22]. Within endometrial cancers	 23/248 carcinomas and 1/56 carcinosarcoma contain 36 and one DICER1 mutations	 respectively; 19% (7/37) of DICER1 mutations are hotspot mutations (see supplementary material	 Table S1). Among 30 non-hotspot mutations	 28 mutations are missense	 one mutation is nonsense	 and one mutation is a frameshift deletion (see supplementary material	 Table S4). Using a Bernoulli approximation	 we estimated the probability of 37 observed DICER1 mutations occurring at random seven or more times at any one of four metal-binding sites	 as 1.64E-12	 suggesting that hotspot mutations are selectively enriched during endometrial cancer development.  To determine whether hotspot DICER1 mutations are a recurrent feature of endometrial carcinomas	 we screened the RNase IIIb domain of DICER1 in 290 endometrial tumours from the OvCaRe tumour bank and a carcinosarcoma of the ovary reported to have a hotspot mutation [11]. The sequencing results were summarized in Table 1 and Figure 1A. In total	 eight heterozygous missense mutations in the RNase IIIb domain of DICER1	 affecting three sites	 E1705	 G1809 and E1813	 were found in seven cases. Mutations at E1705 and E1813 were previously referred to as 'hotspot' mutations and their detrimental effects on 5p miRNA production have been characterized [4	11	 23]. Two heterozygous mutations (c.5115Aâ€‰>â€‰C and c.5113Gâ€‰>â€‰C) were found at the same E1705 codon in one sample. Notably	 we observed a recurrent mutation at G1809 in two cases. Although not a metal-binding site	 glycine at residue 1809 is highly conserved across species and locates within close proximity to the metal ion in the catalytic valley (Figure 1B; see also supplementary material	 Figure S2). The glycine-to-arginine change at residue 1809 is predicted to be damaging (by PolyPhen-2 and SIFT) and highly functional (by Mutation Assessor)	" suggesting that it may be a hotspot mutation and function equivalently to the alterations at the metal-binding residues.

(A) A schematic of DICER1 domains with mutations identified through Sanger and Illumina targeted resequencing. The fill colour of each mutation represents individual tumour samples; note that some samples have two mutations. (B) Similar to the four metal-binding sites (1705"	1709	 1810 and 1813) in the RNase IIIb domain of DICER1	 the glycine at residue 1809 is highly conserved across species Evaluation of biallelic DICER1 mutations  To evaluate a 'two-hit' hypothesis for DICER1 in these tumours	 we performed targeted sequencing for the entire DICER1 exome of all seven tumours with hotspot mutations. In addition	 the entire DICER1 cDNA of those cases was analysed by Sanger sequencing. Potential biallelic DICER1 mutations were identified in four samples. In sample A	 two heterozygous mutations (c.5115Aâ€‰>â€‰C and c.5113Gâ€‰>â€‰C) were shown to be in trans by deep sequencing (Figure 2A)	 leading to two overlapping missense mutations	 E1705D and E1705Q	 respectively. In sample D	 the E1813G mutation was identified by initial genomic DNA (gDNA) sequencing	 and subsequent cDNA sequencing of an amplicon spanning the RNase IIIb domain revealed two products	 a long one containing the canonical DICER1 sequence and a shorter one with a 163â€‰nt deletion missing exon 25 (Figure 2B). This result agreed with a previous observation that the c.5438Aâ€‰>â€‰G (E1813G) mutation in DICER1 promotes inefficient exon 25 exclusion	 producing both a full-length transcript with c.5438Aâ€‰>â€‰G and an exon-25-depleted transcript [13]. Interestingly	 when the longer cDNA amplicon was sequenced	 only c.5438Aâ€‰>â€‰G but no wild-type (WT) sequence was detected (Figure 2B)	 suggesting that the expression of WT DICER1 is lost	 probably due to either a cryptic genomic aberration or epigenetic silencing.  Figure 2.  Figure 2. Open in figure viewerDownload Powerpoint slide Potential biallelic DICER1 mutations in tumours. (A) In case A	 Sanger sequencing identified two point mutations (c.5115Aâ€‰>â€‰C and c.5113Gâ€‰>â€‰C) at the same codon (on the left) and Illumina deep sequencing suggested that they are in trans (on the right). The sequencing reads were aligned to the hg19 reference sequence	 which is the reverse complement of the DICER1 sequence	 as the DICER1 gene is located on the negative strand. (B) In case D	 PCR amplification of cDNA spanning the RNase IIIb domain and subsequent Sanger sequencing revealed two products	 one containing the canonical DICER1 sequence and the other	 shorter	 product with a 163â€‰nt deletion missing exon 25. Notably	 only the c.5438Aâ€‰>â€‰G (E1813G) mutation but no WT sequence was detected in the full-length transcript. (C) In case C	 two heterozygous mutations	 c.5425Gâ€‰>â€‰A (G1809R) and c.2516Câ€‰>â€‰T (S839F)	 were confirmed to be in trans by sequencing the cloned cDNA encompassing both mutations. WT	 wild-type; gDNA	 genomic DNA; cDNA	 complementary DNA To determine the allelic relationship of the two heterozygous mutations in cases B (G1809R and R821C) and C (G1809R and S839F)	 we cloned and sequenced cDNAs spanning both mutations and confirmed that the two mutations from both cases were in trans (Figure 2C; see also supplementary material	 Figure S3A). R821C	 a somatic mutation	 was predicted to be damaging by PolyPhen-2 and SIFT. S839F is present in constitutional DNA and thus is a germline mutation (data not shown). Although S839F was predicted to be tolerated	 ectopic expression of the S839F mutant was noticeably lower at the protein level but not at the mRNA level	 compared to WT or other mutants (see supplementary material	 Figure S4A	 B). This suggests that the G1809R mutant may be the predominantly expressed form of DICER1	 despite being compound heterozygous with S839F in sample C. In samples E	 F and G	 the DICER1 hotspot mutations were heterozygous in both cases	 suggesting the presence of an intact WT allele (see supplementary material	 Figure S3Bâ€“D). Mature miRNA expression in tumours with DICER1 hotspot mutation  To evaluate the impact of DICER1 hotspot mutations on miRNA expression profiles	 we performed deep sequencing on small RNAs in all seven tumours with DICER1 hotspot mutations and five endometrial tumours without hotspot mutations. As expected	 overall 5p miRNA expression was significantly reduced in tumours with DICER1 hotspot mutations [meanâ€‰Â±â€‰standard error (SE)â€‰=â€‰62â€‰Â±â€‰5.2; nâ€‰=â€‰7] compared to tumours without hotspot mutations (meanâ€‰Â±â€‰SEâ€‰=â€‰78â€‰Â±â€‰1.8; nâ€‰=â€‰5; pâ€‰=â€‰0.0212; Figure 3A). We also analysed the miRNA expression data from the TCGA endometrial cancer cohort	 and observed similar results (see supplementary material	 Figure S5): the entire 5p miRNA population was reduced in tumours with DICER1 hotspot mutations (meanâ€‰Â±â€‰SEâ€‰=â€‰54.9â€‰Â±â€‰4.7; nâ€‰=â€‰6) compared to either tumours with DICER1 non-hotspot mutations (meanâ€‰Â±â€‰SEâ€‰=â€‰66.7â€‰Â±â€‰3.1; nâ€‰=â€‰14; pâ€‰=â€‰0.052) or tumours without DICER1 mutations (meanâ€‰Â±â€‰SEâ€‰=â€‰67.7â€‰Â±â€‰0.5; nâ€‰=â€‰375; pâ€‰=â€‰0.001). However	 the reduction of 5p miRNAs in tumours with hotspot mutations was not as drastic as in DICER1-null cell lines that express hotspot mutants [4	 12]	 which may be due to other confounding factors in tumours	 such as the presence of WT allele	 DICER1 variant allele frequency	 additional genetic aberrations	 intratumour heterogeneity	 tumour cell content and cell-free circulating miRNAs.  Figure 3.  Figure 3. Open in figure viewerDownload Powerpoint slide Small RNA sequencing of tumours with or without DICER1 hotspot mutations. (A) The entire 5p miRNA population was significantly reduced in seven tumours with hotspot mutations (meanâ€‰Â±â€‰SEâ€‰=â€‰62â€‰Â±â€‰5.2) compared to five tumours without hotspot mutations (meanâ€‰Â±â€‰SEâ€‰=â€‰78â€‰Â±â€‰1.8). (B) The 5p:3p ratio of miR-99b	 a 5p_strand predominant miRNA	 was drastically reduced in tumours harbouring DICER1 hotspot mutations (meanâ€‰Â±â€‰SEâ€‰=â€‰118.8â€‰Â±â€‰60.7) compared to tumours without hotspot mutations (meanâ€‰Â±â€‰SEâ€‰=â€‰486.9â€‰Â±â€‰31.9). (C) The 3p:5p ratio of miR-27b	 a 3p_strand predominant miRNA	 was slightly increased in tumours possessing DICER1 hotspot mutations (meanâ€‰Â±â€‰SEâ€‰=â€‰533.9â€‰Â±â€‰63.1) compared to tumours without hotspot mutations (meanâ€‰Â±â€‰SEâ€‰=â€‰425.5â€‰Â±â€‰53.8). Individual miRNAs were normalized by dividing raw reads by the total number of miRNA aligned reads in the libraryâ€‰Ã—â€‰1 million. The p values were calculated by independent samples t-test Among specific miRNAs	 the relative abundance between 5p- and 3p- strands derived from the same pre-miRNA varied greatly. In general	 miRNAs can be classified into two groups: 5p_strand predominant miRNAs (eg miR-99b	 miR-181a	 let-7a) or 3p_strand predominant miRNAs (eg miR-27b	 miR-221	 miR-199a). The 5p:3p ratio of 5p_strand predominant miRNAs was drastically reduced in tumours with hotspot mutations compared to tumours without hotspot mutations (Figure 3B; see also supplementary material	 Figure S6A)	 while the 3p:5p ratio of 3p_strand predominant miRNAs was slightly increased in tumours with hotspot mutations (Figure 3C; see also supplementary material	 Figure S6B). Since DICER1 hotspot mutations severely impair the production of 5p miRNAs [4	11	 12]	 it is not surprising that mainly 5p_strand predominant miRNAs were affected by the defects. Characterization of the functional impact of G1809R on miRNA biogenesis  To test the hypothesis that the G1809R mutation impairs the enzymatic function of the DICER1 RNase IIIb domain	 we compared the in vitro cleavage activity of this mutant to a well-characterized hotspot mutation	 D1709N [4	 11]. Both G1809R and D1709N DICER1 mutants failed to cleave the 5â€²-labelled pre-let-7c miRNA (Figure 4A) at the RNase IIIb processing site in vitro	 as shown by the nearly absent amount of the 22â€‰nt 5p let-7c miRNA and the accumulation of the 45â€‰nt let-7c intermediate RNA	 whereas WT DICER1 produced the expected 22â€‰nt 5p let-7c miRNA (Figure 4B). These data suggested that the G1809R mutation adversely affects 5p miRNA production	 similar to the D1709N and other mutations at metal-binding sites [4	 11].  Figure 4.  Figure 4.

(B) The DICER1 G1809R mutation impaired RNase IIIb activity in vitro. Assays were performed on a pre-let-7c RNA substrate (see part A). The G1809R and D1709N mutants lacked RNase IIIb cleavage activity	 resulting in a 45â€‰nt intermediate cleavage product (green arrow). WT DICER1 had IIIb cleavage activity	 resulting in the expected 22â€‰nt mature let-7c miRNA (red arrow). A mock control (substrate only in reaction mix) was used to assess degradation of the substrate during the reaction. The full gel containing the intervening lanes can be found in Figure S7A (see supplementary material) to establish band alignment between the lanes. (C) Small RNA sequencing revealed that the 5p miRNA population was reduced from 50% toâ€‰<â€‰20% of total miRNAs in cells expressing G1809R and G1809K	 which is functionally equivalent to a bona fide hotspot mutation D1709N. The 5p population was unchanged in G1809A compared to WT. (D	 E) Real-time PCR analysis of selected miRNAs. Two 5p miRNAs	 miR-99b and let-7	 were virtually undetectable in cells expressing D1709N	 G1809R and G1809K (D). Two 3p miRNAs	 miR-22 and miR-27b	 were present but slightly reduced in cells expressing D1709N	 G1809R and G1809K (E). As expected	 no miRNA was detected in DKO172 cells or DKO172 cells expressing GFP. The endogenous small nuclear RNA RNU1A1 was used as an internal control. Each sample was measured in triplicate; data are shown as meanâ€‰Â±â€‰SE To further evaluate the ex vivo functional impact of DICER1 mutations at residue 1809 on miRNA production	 we performed small RNA deep sequencing on Dicer1-null DKO172 cells [17] transfected with vectors expressing WT or mutant DICER1 in which the uncharged glycine at residue 1809 was replaced with alanine	 arginine and lysine. The side-chain of alanine is a small uncharged methyl group	 while both arginine and lysine have bulky	 positively charged side-chains (see supplementary material	 Figure S7B). We hypothesized that G1809A	 an amino acid substitution that does not change the charge of the side-chain and was not seen in tumours	 would not interfere with DICER1 function	 whereas both tumour-associated G1809R and the similarly charged G1809K substitution would disrupt the enzymatic activity of the RNase IIIb domain	 leading to loss of 5p miRNAs. The small RNA sequencing results revealed thatâ€‰âˆ¼â€‰50% of total miRNAs are 5p miRNAs in DKO172 cells expressing WT DICER1 or G1809A	 while the 5p miRNA population was drastically reduced toâ€‰<â€‰20% of total miRNAs in cells expressing G1809R or G1809K	 similar to the cells expressing a bona fide hotspot mutant D1709N (Figure 4C). The global reduction of miRNA species in all sequencing reads was mainly due to the loss of 5p miRNAs (see supplementary material	 Figure S7C). We also observed a partial decrease of 3p miRNAs in cells expressing hotspot mutants	 which agrees with a previous finding [12]. To confirm the results from small RNA sequencing	 we examined the expression of individual miRNAs	 using real-time PCR. Complete loss of 5p miRNAs	 ie let-7c and miR-99b	 and partial reduction of 3p miRNAs	 ie miR-22 and miR-27	 were observed in DKO172 cells expressing G1809R	 G1809K or D1709N mutants (Figure 4D	 E). Therefore	 our data demonstrated that a positively charged side-chain at residue 1809 would have detrimental effects on the cleavage of 5p miRNAs from precursor miRNAs. DICER1 hotspot mutation affects downstream pathways associated with cell proliferation  Loss of miRNAs should	 in part	 directly de-repress mRNA levels and therefore lead to increased target gene expression. In order to understand the impact of losing 5p miRNAs on downstream cell signalling pathways	 we profiled mRNA expression in DKO172 cells expressing WT DICER1 or mutants. Consistent with previous results	 two DICER1 hotspot mutants	 D1709N and G1809R	 clustered together by unsupervised hierarchical clustering	 indicating that they have very similar expression profiles and are functionally equivalent (Figure 5A). Furthermore	 DICER1 mutants were clustered further away from WT DICER1 than the GFP control	 indicating that the gene expression profiles of hotspot mutants are more similar to the profile of Dicer1-null than to that of WT DICER1 (Figure 5A). To identify genes differentially expressed due to hotspot mutations	 gene expression profiles of D1709N and G1809R were compared to that of WT; > 90% of up-regulated genes (fold changeâ€‰â‰¥â€‰2) in D1709N and G1809R were the same when compared to WT (Figure 5B)	 supporting the notion that the two DICER1 mutants function alike. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used to analyse the cellular functions of 832 genes that were up-regulated in both mutants	 and revealed that the most significantly enriched gene ontology categories were associated with cell cycle progression (Table 2; see also supplementary material	 Table S5).

WT DICER1 strongly repressed cell proliferation	 whereas the D1709N and G1809R mutants displayed a moderate growth advantage over Dicer1-null cells expressing the GFP control (Figure 5C). This is in agreement with the data showing that DICER1 hotspot mutations up-regulate genes promoting cell proliferation (Table 2). Therefore	 our data suggest that hotspot mutations impair the tumour-suppressive effect of DICER1 in DKO172 cells.  Studies have shown that the miRNA seed sequence	 nucleotides 2â€“7 from the 5â€² end of a miRNA	 is essential for target recognition [24	 25]. Many miRNA genes have multiple isoforms that share conserved seed regions and can be grouped into specific miRNA families. Based on miRNA seed sequences	 Ingenuity Pathway Analysis predicted that the let-7 family is a key regulator and directly regulates 53/832 genes that were up-regulated in cells expressing DICER1 hotspot mutants (see supplementary material	 Table S6). This is not surprising	 because the let-7 family	 composed of let-7-a1 	 âˆ’a2 	 âˆ’b 	 âˆ’c1 	 âˆ’c2 	 âˆ’d 	 âˆ’e 	 âˆ’f1 	 âˆ’f2 	 âˆ’g 	 âˆ’i and miR-98 (www.targetscan.org)	 is the most abundant 5p miRNA family in DKO172 cells expressing WT DICER1 and is completely lost in hotspot mutant-expressing cells (Figure 5D; see also supplementary material	 Figure S9). The let-7 family miRNAs are well known tumour suppressors that repress cell proliferation pathways [26]. Targets of let-7 that were increased in DICER1 hotspot mutants	 such as CDC25A	 CCNA2	 CCNE1	 CDK1	 SKP2	 LIN28A/B	 etc.	 are important regulators of cell cycle progression. Discussion  In this study	 we report that DICER1 hotspot mutations are present in âˆ¼2% of endometrial tumours. This is consistent across both the TCGA dataset (7/304) and our own local tumour bank (6/290; see supplementary material	 Tables S1	 S7). DICER1 hotspot mutations	 although rare	 were also identified in brain	 colorectal and thyroid cancers (see supplementary material	 Table S1). Aksoy and colleagues [27] also reported similar results using data from the TCGA in a preprint when we were preparing this manuscript. Together	 our findings suggest that the DICER1 hotspot mutations may impact tumourigenesis beyond the spectrum of rare paediatric cancers [8-13	 15-18]. DICER1 hotspot mutations and subsequent miRNA/mRNA dysregulation may therefore constitute a common oncogenic pathway in a small subset of endometrial tumours.  We identified a recurrent G1809R DICER1 mutation	 which is located at a highly conserved site and is in close spatial proximity to the metal-binding residues (E1810 and D1813) in the RNase IIIb domain of DICER1. During the preparation of our manuscript	 several studies identified G1809R mutations in both PPB and Wilms' tumour [16	 28-30] and a G1809V mutation in Wilms' tumour [30]. We demonstrated that the G1809R mutation impairs 5p miRNA production in vitro with RNA cleavage assays (Figure 4). We characterized the impact of G1809R on miRNA production in an isogenic cell line model	 and confirmed that G1809R is functionally equivalent to previously characterized hotspot mutations [4	11	 12]. We also found that not all mutations at residue 1809 will impair RNase IIIb cleavage activity; for example	 substituting glycine with alanine	 a small uncharged residue	 did not impair miRNA processing	 while the substitution of large positively charged residues	 such as arginine or lysine	 led to loss of 5p miRNA production (Figure 4). In one case	 G1809R was compound heterozygous with a germline S839F mutation. This is of particular interest	 because the heterozygous S839F DICER1 mutation has been reported to be highly penetrant in a large family with MNG [7]. Western blot results suggested that ectopic expression of S839F mutant reduces DICER1 protein levels (see supplementary material	 Figure S4)	 and thus may produce a hypomorphic phenotype in vivo	 although the detailed mechanism of this mutation warrants further investigation.  In summary	 we have shown that four of seven tumours with DICER1 hotspot mutations potentially fitted the two-hit hypothesis for DICER1 involvement in tumourigenesis. In the TCGA endometrial cohort	 five of six cases with hotspot mutations possessed additional DICER1 mutations (see supplementary material	 Table S1). However	 whether those mutations were in trans or deleterious remained to be determined. No loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was observed in tumours with DICER1 hotspot mutations (see supplementary material	 Figure S8). Overall	 down-regulation of 5p miRNAs was observed in tumours with DICER1 hotspot mutations (Figure 3A; see also supplementary material	 Figure S5). The 5p miRNA abundance in the total miRNA population was lower in tumours with 'two-hit' (meanâ€‰Â±â€‰SEâ€‰=â€‰57.5â€‰Â±â€‰7.8; nâ€‰=â€‰4) compared to its level in tumours with a single hotspot hit (meanâ€‰Â±â€‰SEâ€‰=â€‰68â€‰Â±â€‰6; nâ€‰=â€‰3). However	 the difference was not significant (pâ€‰=â€‰0.36)	 which may be due to the limited sample size. Future studies are needed to address whether hotspot alleles can compete with WT alleles for miRNA processing.  Early mouse models suggested that Dicer1 might function as a haplo-insufficient tumour-suppressor gene	 in that loss of a single allele of Dicer1 promotes tumour formation but loss of both alleles stalls tumour development in an oncogenic Kras or retinoblastoma-sensitized background [31	 32]. Initial clinical studies found that PPB and PPBâ€“FTDS patients carry heterozygous DICER1 germline mutations and no homozygous loss of DICER1 was observed [6	 33]	 which supported the DICER1 haplo-insufficiency hypothesis. However	 this model was contradicted by recent studies showing that Dicer1-null cells (KrasG12DTrp53 âˆ’/ âˆ’Dicer1 âˆ’/ âˆ’) from a mouse sarcoma cell line are competent for tumour formation	 and that Pten/Dicer1 double-knockout mice develop primary fallopian tube tumours [17	 34]. These divergent results suggest that the DICER1 haplo-insufficiency hypothesis may only apply to specific tissues or tumour models.  The two-hit hypothesis for DICER1 was initially proposed after identification of DICER1 hotspot mutations in tumours from PPB and PPBâ€“FTDS patients with germline DICER1 mutations [11	13	 29]. More recently	 frequent biallelic DICER1 mutations were identified in sporadic (8/11) and germline PPB (12/12) from two independent studies [16	 28]. The biallelic DICER1 mutations predominantly involved a loss-of-function mutation in one allele and a hotspot mutation in the other allele	 although homozygous hotspot mutations were observed in two sporadic PPB cases [28] and complete loss of functional DICER1 was reported in several pineoblastomas [10	 35]. Mosaic germline DICER1 hotspot mutations were associated with a novel human overgrowth syndrome [36]	 suggesting that a DICER1 hotspot mutation may be oncogenic regardless of the presence of WT DICER1. Transgenic animal models are needed to delineate the oncogenic effects of DICER1 hotspot mutations in future studies.  The recurrent DICER1 hotspot mutations act more like oncogenic gain-of-function than loss-of-function mutations. Using a Dicer1/Pten double-knockout murine fallopian tumour cell model	 we demonstrated that DICER1 hotspot mutations provide a growth advantage over Dicer1-null cells	 in stark contrast to the repressive effects of WT DICER1. Genes de-repressed in DICER1 mutants	 of which many are targets of the let-7 family miRNAs	 were enriched in pathways associated with cell cycle progression (Table 2). Our data agree with previous speculation that loss of let-7	 a well-known tumour suppressor	 might have a profound impact on downstream pathways [4	 12].  More than 50000 women were diagnosed with endometrial cancer in the USA in 2014 (http://www.cancer.gov/). Although DICER1 hotspot mutations are found inâ€‰âˆ¼â€‰2% of endometrial cancers	 they could affect a substantial number of patients (âˆ¼1000 cases/year). Our finding suggests that defects in the miRNA processing pathway may provide a new prospect for drug development and cancer therapy beyond rare paediatric cancers. 																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												
4	36|| Abstract  DICER1 plays a critical role in microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis. Recurrent somatic 'hotspot' mutations at the four metal-binding sites within the RNase IIIb domain of DICER1 were identified in ovarian sex cord-stromal tumours and have since been described in other paediatric tumours. In this study	 we screened the RNase IIIb domain of DICER1 in 290 endometrial tumours and identified six cases with hotspot mutations	 including two cases affected by an atypical G1809R mutation directly adjacent to a metal-binding site. Using Illumina and Sanger targeted resequencing	 we observed and validated biallelic DICER1 mutations in several cases with hotspot mutations. Through in vitro DICER1 cleavage assays	 small RNA deep sequencing and real-time PCR	 we demonstrated that mutations adding a positively charged side chain to residue 1809 have similar detrimental effects on 5p miRNA production to mutations at the metal-binding sites. As expected	 5p miRNAs were globally reduced in tumours and cell lines with hotspot mutations. Pathway analysis of gene expression profiles indicated that genes de-repressed due to loss of 5p miRNAs are strongly associated with pathways regulating the cell cycle. Using a Dicer1-null mouse cell line model	 we found that expression of DICER1 hotspot mutants promoted cell proliferation	 whereas wild-type (WT) DICER1 inhibited cell proliferation. Furthermore	 targets of let-7 family miRNAs are enriched among the up-regulated genes	 suggesting that loss of let-7 may be impacting downstream pathways. Our results reveal that DICER1 hotspot mutations are implicated in common malignancies and may constitute a unique oncogenic pathway.

Introduction  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are âˆ¼22 nucleotide (nt)	 single-stranded	 non-coding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression in animals and plants [1]. miRNAs play crucial roles in maintaining normal cellular functions	 such as differentiation	 proliferation and apoptosis [2]. The biogenesis of miRNAs starts with the transcription of long primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs)	 which are then processed into âˆ¼70â€‰nt hairpin precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) by the endoribonuclease Drosha. Pre-miRNAs are subsequently transported to the cytoplasm by Exportin 5 (XPO5)	 where they are further trimmed by DICER1	 another endoribonuclease. The two RNase III domains of DICER1	 which form an intramolecular dimer	 cleave the pre-miRNA hairpin to generate miRNA duplexes composed of 5p and 3p miRNAs that emanate from the 5â€² and 3â€² arms	 respectively	 of the hairpin [3	 4]. The 'guide strand' will be preferentially incorporated into an miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC) and interacts with target mRNAs	 whereas the 'passenger strand' is often degraded. Since a single defect in the components of the miRNA biogenesis pathway could potentially affect the entire miRNA population	 it is not surprising that disruptions of this pathway are associated with a variety of human malignancies [5].  DICER1 germline mutations are known to predispose carriers to cancer [5]	 such as familial pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB) [6]. Furthermore	 heterozygous germline DICER1 mutations have been identified in PPB-related familial tumourâ€“dysplasia syndrome (PPBâ€“FTDS)	 multinodular goitre (MNG)	 Sertoliâ€“Leydig cell tumour (SLCT)	 cystic nephroma (CN)	 Wilms' tumour	 cervical embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (cERM) and pineoblastoma [7-10]. We recently identified recurrent somatic DICER1 hotspot mutations in rare non-epithelial ovarian tumours [11]. Subsequent studies have shown that hotspot mutations at the four metal-binding sites in the RNase IIIb domain (E1705	 D1709	 D1810 and E1813) impair DICER1's ability to generate mature 5p miRNAs [4	11	 12]. More recently	 DICER1 hotspot mutations were identified in tumours from PPB and PPBâ€“FTDS cases possessing germline DICER1 mutations	 suggesting a two-hit hypothesis of tumourigenesis [11	 13-16].  The mutational analyses of DICER1 have previously focused on rare paediatric cancers [6-11	 13-16]. In this study	 we investigated the prevalence of DICER1 mutations in a spectrum of more common malignancies. We screened for DICER1 hotspot mutations in 290 endometrial tumours	 and evaluated the two-hit hypothesis in cases with hotspot mutations. We identified an atypical hotspot mutation	 G1809R	 which is immediately adjacent to the metal-binding residue D1810	 and characterized its functional impact on miRNAs and downstream signalling pathways. Using a Dicer1-null mouse fallopian tube carcinoma-derived cell line [17]	 we demonstrated that DICER1 hotspot mutations abolish the inhibitory effects of DICER1 on cell proliferation. Our data also suggested that loss of let-7 family miRNAs may contribute to the oncogenic properties of DICER1 hotspot mutations. Materials and methods  Patient samples and cell culture  All the patient tumour and blood samples were collected from the Ovarian Cancer Research Programme (OvCaRe) tissue bank (Vancouver	 British Columbia	 Canada) under ethical approvals from the University of British Columbia and BC Cancer Agency Research Ethics Board [11].  DKO172 cells	 derived from a Dicer1/Pten double-knockout mouse fallopian tube tumour model [17]	 were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/F12 (Hyclone) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37â€‰Â°C and 5% CO2. DNA and RNA extraction  DNA was extracted using DNeasy Blood & Tissue or QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kits (Qiagen)	 and RNA was extracted using miRNeasy or miRNeasy FFPE kits (Qiagen)	 according to the manufacturer's protocols. PCR and Sanger sequencing  Primer sets and the protocol used to sequence the RNase IIIb domain of DICER1 have been described in previous studies [11	 18]. Primer sets for DICER1 cDNA sequencing are listed in Table S2 (see supplementary material). PCR products were sequenced on an ABI Prism 3130xl Genetic Analyser (Applied Biosystems) and visualized using 4peaks (Mek&Tosj).  To determine whether two DICER1 mutations from the same sample are in trans or in cis	 a single amplicon encompassing two mutations was amplified and cloned into pCR2.1	 using a TOPO TA-Cloning Kit (Life Technologies). Ten colonies of each sample were Sanger sequenced for both hotspot and non-hotspot mutations. Targeted DICER1 amplicon resequencing  The sequencing protocol was adopted from Forshew et al [19]. Target-specific amplification was performed on a microfluidic system using the 48.48 Access Array Integrated Fluidic Circuit	 following the manufacturer's user guide (Fluidigm; for more information	 see supplementary material	 Supplementary materials and methods and Table S3). Small RNA sequencing  Total RNA was quantified using the QubitÂ® RNA BR Assay Kit (Life Technologies) and diluted to 200â€‰ng/ Î¼l. Small RNA libraries were prepared using the TruSeq Small RNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina)	 according to the manufacturer's instructions (for more information	 see supplementary material	 Supplementary materials and methods). Plasmid construction  A series of DICER1 mutants were generated from pDONR221-wild-type DICER1 (WT) [4] by site-directed mutagenesis (Agilent) and shuttled into pLD-hygro-EnVM vector [20] through Gateway LR-clonase reaction (Invitrogen). Sanger sequencing verified the DICER1 mutations in the vectors. GFP-expressing vectors were used as the vector controls. Western blotting  Cell lysates (30â€‰ Î¼g) were separated on 8% sodium dodecyl sulphateâ€“polyacrylamide gels (SDSâ€“PAGE) and then were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The DICER1 antibody (Santa Cruz	 sc-30226) was used to detect both mouse and human DICER1 forms. Vinculin (Sigma	 V9131) was used as the loading control. DICER1 in vitro cleavage assay  Pre-let-7c miRNA was generated by in vitro transcription of a DNA template oligo (5â€²-GGAAAGCTAGAAGGTTGTACAGTTAACTCCCAGGGTGTAACTCTAAACCATACAACCTACTACCTCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTACAT-3â€²) annealed to the 5â€²-ATGTAATACGAC TCACTATAG-3â€² oligo using the MEGAscript Â® T7 Transcription Kit (Invitrogen). The RNA transcript was gel-purified and 5â€²-32P end-labelled. The preparation of DICER1 enzymes and in vitro DICER cleavage assays were performed as previously described [11]. The resulting products were visualized on a storage phosphor screen	 using a FLA-7000 instrument (GE Healthcare). miRNA and mRNA real-time PCR  The expression of individual miRNAs was quantified using the miRCURY LNA Universal RT microRNA PCR system (Exiqon)	 in triplicate	 following the manufacturer's instructions. The endogenous small nuclear RNA RNU1A1 was used for normalization. The expression of mRNA transcripts was determined using cDNA converted from total RNA	 followed by real-time PCR with Power SYBR Â® Green Master Mix (Life Technologies) [4]. The mouse housekeeping gene Actb was used for normalization. The relative levels were calculated using the Î”Î”Ct method [21]. Cell growth and gene expression analysis  DKO172 cells were transfected with 2â€‰ Î¼g pLD-hygro-EnVM vectors expressing WT DICER1	 D1709N	 G1809R or GFP	 using the TransIT Â®-LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus)	 followed by selection in 300â€‰ Î¼g/ml hygromycin for 84â€‰h. Cells were then harvested for RNA extraction or replated in 96-well plates at 2000 cells/well. Cell growth was monitored by the IncuCyte ZOOM Live Content Imaging System (Essen BioScience). The gene expression profiles were determined using the Agilent SurePrint G3 mouse gene expression microarrays	 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Array data were filtered	 normalized	 analysed and visualized by GeneSpring GX (v. 12	 Agilent). Raw data can be accessed via NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE65092). Results  DICER1 hotspot mutations in endometrial tumours  To evaluate the prevalence of DICER1 mutations in common malignancies	 we examined the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cBioPortal database (http://www.cbioportal.org) and discovered that endometrial carcinomas have the highest frequency of DICER1 mutations (see supplementary material	 Figure S1) [22]. Within endometrial cancers	 23/248 carcinomas and 1/56 carcinosarcoma contain 36 and one DICER1 mutations	 respectively; 19% (7/37) of DICER1 mutations are hotspot mutations (see supplementary material	 Table S1). Among 30 non-hotspot mutations	 28 mutations are missense	 one mutation is nonsense	 and one mutation is a frameshift deletion (see supplementary material	 Table S4). Using a Bernoulli approximation	 we estimated the probability of 37 observed DICER1 mutations occurring at random seven or more times at any one of four metal-binding sites	 as 1.64E-12	 suggesting that hotspot mutations are selectively enriched during endometrial cancer development.  To determine whether hotspot DICER1 mutations are a recurrent feature of endometrial carcinomas	 we screened the RNase IIIb domain of DICER1 in 290 endometrial tumours from the OvCaRe tumour bank and a carcinosarcoma of the ovary reported to have a hotspot mutation [11]. The sequencing results were summarized in Table 1 and Figure 1A. In total	 eight heterozygous missense mutations in the RNase IIIb domain of DICER1	 affecting three sites	 E1705	 G1809 and E1813	 were found in seven cases. Mutations at E1705 and E1813 were previously referred to as 'hotspot' mutations and their detrimental effects on 5p miRNA production have been characterized [4	11	 23]. Two heterozygous mutations (c.5115Aâ€‰>â€‰C and c.5113Gâ€‰>â€‰C) were found at the same E1705 codon in one sample. Notably	 we observed a recurrent mutation at G1809 in two cases. Although not a metal-binding site	 glycine at residue 1809 is highly conserved across species and locates within close proximity to the metal ion in the catalytic valley (Figure 1B; see also supplementary material	 Figure S2). The glycine-to-arginine change at residue 1809 is predicted to be damaging (by PolyPhen-2 and SIFT) and highly functional (by Mutation Assessor)	" suggesting that it may be a hotspot mutation and function equivalently to the alterations at the metal-binding residues.

(B) Similar to the four metal-binding sites (1705"	1709	 1810 and 1813) in the RNase IIIb domain of DICER1	 the glycine at residue 1809 is highly conserved across species Evaluation of biallelic DICER1 mutations  To evaluate a 'two-hit' hypothesis for DICER1 in these tumours	 we performed targeted sequencing for the entire DICER1 exome of all seven tumours with hotspot mutations. In addition	 the entire DICER1 cDNA of those cases was analysed by Sanger sequencing. Potential biallelic DICER1 mutations were identified in four samples. In sample A	 two heterozygous mutations (c.5115Aâ€‰>â€‰C and c.5113Gâ€‰>â€‰C) were shown to be in trans by deep sequencing (Figure 2A)	 leading to two overlapping missense mutations	 E1705D and E1705Q	 respectively. In sample D	 the E1813G mutation was identified by initial genomic DNA (gDNA) sequencing	 and subsequent cDNA sequencing of an amplicon spanning the RNase IIIb domain revealed two products	 a long one containing the canonical DICER1 sequence and a shorter one with a 163â€‰nt deletion missing exon 25 (Figure 2B). This result agreed with a previous observation that the c.5438Aâ€‰>â€‰G (E1813G) mutation in DICER1 promotes inefficient exon 25 exclusion	 producing both a full-length transcript with c.5438Aâ€‰>â€‰G and an exon-25-depleted transcript [13]. Interestingly	 when the longer cDNA amplicon was sequenced	 only c.5438Aâ€‰>â€‰G but no wild-type (WT) sequence was detected (Figure 2B)	 suggesting that the expression of WT DICER1 is lost	 probably due to either a cryptic genomic aberration or epigenetic silencing.  Figure 2.  Figure 2. Open in figure viewerDownload Powerpoint slide Potential biallelic DICER1 mutations in tumours. (A) In case A	 Sanger sequencing identified two point mutations (c.5115Aâ€‰>â€‰C and c.5113Gâ€‰>â€‰C) at the same codon (on the left) and Illumina deep sequencing suggested that they are in trans (on the right). The sequencing reads were aligned to the hg19 reference sequence	 which is the reverse complement of the DICER1 sequence	 as the DICER1 gene is located on the negative strand. (B) In case D	 PCR amplification of cDNA spanning the RNase IIIb domain and subsequent Sanger sequencing revealed two products	 one containing the canonical DICER1 sequence and the other	 shorter	 product with a 163â€‰nt deletion missing exon 25. Notably	 only the c.5438Aâ€‰>â€‰G (E1813G) mutation but no WT sequence was detected in the full-length transcript. (C) In case C	 two heterozygous mutations	 c.5425Gâ€‰>â€‰A (G1809R) and c.2516Câ€‰>â€‰T (S839F)	 were confirmed to be in trans by sequencing the cloned cDNA encompassing both mutations. WT	 wild-type; gDNA	 genomic DNA; cDNA	 complementary DNA To determine the allelic relationship of the two heterozygous mutations in cases B (G1809R and R821C) and C (G1809R and S839F)	 we cloned and sequenced cDNAs spanning both mutations and confirmed that the two mutations from both cases were in trans (Figure 2C; see also supplementary material	 Figure S3A). R821C	 a somatic mutation	 was predicted to be damaging by PolyPhen-2 and SIFT. S839F is present in constitutional DNA and thus is a germline mutation (data not shown). Although S839F was predicted to be tolerated	 ectopic expression of the S839F mutant was noticeably lower at the protein level but not at the mRNA level	 compared to WT or other mutants (see supplementary material	 Figure S4A	 B). This suggests that the G1809R mutant may be the predominantly expressed form of DICER1	 despite being compound heterozygous with S839F in sample C. In samples E	 F and G	 the DICER1 hotspot mutations were heterozygous in both cases	 suggesting the presence of an intact WT allele (see supplementary material	 Figure S3Bâ€“D). Mature miRNA expression in tumours with DICER1 hotspot mutation  To evaluate the impact of DICER1 hotspot mutations on miRNA expression profiles	 we performed deep sequencing on small RNAs in all seven tumours with DICER1 hotspot mutations and five endometrial tumours without hotspot mutations. As expected	 overall 5p miRNA expression was significantly reduced in tumours with DICER1 hotspot mutations [meanâ€‰Â±â€‰standard error (SE)â€‰=â€‰62â€‰Â±â€‰5.2; nâ€‰=â€‰7] compared to tumours without hotspot mutations (meanâ€‰Â±â€‰SEâ€‰=â€‰78â€‰Â±â€‰1.8; nâ€‰=â€‰5; pâ€‰=â€‰0.0212; Figure 3A). We also analysed the miRNA expression data from the TCGA endometrial cancer cohort	 and observed similar results (see supplementary material	 Figure S5): the entire 5p miRNA population was reduced in tumours with DICER1 hotspot mutations (meanâ€‰Â±â€‰SEâ€‰=â€‰54.9â€‰Â±â€‰4.7; nâ€‰=â€‰6) compared to either tumours with DICER1 non-hotspot mutations (meanâ€‰Â±â€‰SEâ€‰=â€‰66.7â€‰Â±â€‰3.1; nâ€‰=â€‰14; pâ€‰=â€‰0.052) or tumours without DICER1 mutations (meanâ€‰Â±â€‰SEâ€‰=â€‰67.7â€‰Â±â€‰0.5; nâ€‰=â€‰375; pâ€‰=â€‰0.001). However	 the reduction of 5p miRNAs in tumours with hotspot mutations was not as drastic as in DICER1-null cell lines that express hotspot mutants [4	 12]	 which may be due to other confounding factors in tumours	 such as the presence of WT allele	 DICER1 variant allele frequency	 additional genetic aberrations	 intratumour heterogeneity	 tumour cell content and cell-free circulating miRNAs.  Figure 3.  Figure 3. Open in figure viewerDownload Powerpoint slide Small RNA sequencing of tumours with or without DICER1 hotspot mutations. (A) The entire 5p miRNA population was significantly reduced in seven tumours with hotspot mutations (meanâ€‰Â±â€‰SEâ€‰=â€‰62â€‰Â±â€‰5.2) compared to five tumours without hotspot mutations (meanâ€‰Â±â€‰SEâ€‰=â€‰78â€‰Â±â€‰1.8). (B) The 5p:3p ratio of miR-99b	 a 5p_strand predominant miRNA	 was drastically reduced in tumours harbouring DICER1 hotspot mutations (meanâ€‰Â±â€‰SEâ€‰=â€‰118.8â€‰Â±â€‰60.7) compared to tumours without hotspot mutations (meanâ€‰Â±â€‰SEâ€‰=â€‰486.9â€‰Â±â€‰31.9). (C) The 3p:5p ratio of miR-27b	 a 3p_strand predominant miRNA	 was slightly increased in tumours possessing DICER1 hotspot mutations (meanâ€‰Â±â€‰SEâ€‰=â€‰533.9â€‰Â±â€‰63.1) compared to tumours without hotspot mutations (meanâ€‰Â±â€‰SEâ€‰=â€‰425.5â€‰Â±â€‰53.8). Individual miRNAs were normalized by dividing raw reads by the total number of miRNA aligned reads in the libraryâ€‰Ã—â€‰1 million. The p values were calculated by independent samples t-test Among specific miRNAs	 the relative abundance between 5p- and 3p- strands derived from the same pre-miRNA varied greatly. In general	 miRNAs can be classified into two groups: 5p_strand predominant miRNAs (eg miR-99b	 miR-181a	 let-7a) or 3p_strand predominant miRNAs (eg miR-27b	 miR-221	 miR-199a). The 5p:3p ratio of 5p_strand predominant miRNAs was drastically reduced in tumours with hotspot mutations compared to tumours without hotspot mutations (Figure 3B; see also supplementary material	 Figure S6A)	 while the 3p:5p ratio of 3p_strand predominant miRNAs was slightly increased in tumours with hotspot mutations (Figure 3C; see also supplementary material	 Figure S6B). Since DICER1 hotspot mutations severely impair the production of 5p miRNAs [4	11	 12]	 it is not surprising that mainly 5p_strand predominant miRNAs were affected by the defects. Characterization of the functional impact of G1809R on miRNA biogenesis  To test the hypothesis that the G1809R mutation impairs the enzymatic function of the DICER1 RNase IIIb domain	 we compared the in vitro cleavage activity of this mutant to a well-characterized hotspot mutation	 D1709N [4	 11]. Both G1809R and D1709N DICER1 mutants failed to cleave the 5â€²-labelled pre-let-7c miRNA (Figure 4A) at the RNase IIIb processing site in vitro	 as shown by the nearly absent amount of the 22â€‰nt 5p let-7c miRNA and the accumulation of the 45â€‰nt let-7c intermediate RNA	 whereas WT DICER1 produced the expected 22â€‰nt 5p let-7c miRNA (Figure 4B). These data suggested that the G1809R mutation adversely affects 5p miRNA production	 similar to the D1709N and other mutations at metal-binding sites [4	 11].  Figure 4.  Figure 4. Open in figure viewerDownload Powerpoint slide Functional impact of DICER1 mutations at residue 1809 on miRNA production. (A) Pre-let-7c structure showing cleavage sites of DICER1 RNases IIIa and IIIb: sequence in red indicates the mature 5p let-7c miRNA released by DICER1 activity; green sequence shows the 3p miRNA product; *5â€²-end 32P label. (B) The DICER1 G1809R mutation impaired RNase IIIb activity in vitro. Assays were performed on a pre-let-7c RNA substrate (see part A). The G1809R and D1709N mutants lacked RNase IIIb cleavage activity	 resulting in a 45â€‰nt intermediate cleavage product (green arrow). WT DICER1 had IIIb cleavage activity	 resulting in the expected 22â€‰nt mature let-7c miRNA (red arrow). A mock control (substrate only in reaction mix) was used to assess degradation of the substrate during the reaction. The full gel containing the intervening lanes can be found in Figure S7A (see supplementary material) to establish band alignment between the lanes. (C) Small RNA sequencing revealed that the 5p miRNA population was reduced from 50% toâ€‰<â€‰20% of total miRNAs in cells expressing G1809R and G1809K	 which is functionally equivalent to a bona fide hotspot mutation D1709N. The 5p population was unchanged in G1809A compared to WT. (D	 E) Real-time PCR analysis of selected miRNAs. Two 5p miRNAs	 miR-99b and let-7	 were virtually undetectable in cells expressing D1709N	 G1809R and G1809K (D). Two 3p miRNAs	 miR-22 and miR-27b	 were present but slightly reduced in cells expressing D1709N	 G1809R and G1809K (E). As expected	 no miRNA was detected in DKO172 cells or DKO172 cells expressing GFP. The endogenous small nuclear RNA RNU1A1 was used as an internal control. Each sample was measured in triplicate; data are shown as meanâ€‰Â±â€‰SE To further evaluate the ex vivo functional impact of DICER1 mutations at residue 1809 on miRNA production	 we performed small RNA deep sequencing on Dicer1-null DKO172 cells [17] transfected with vectors expressing WT or mutant DICER1 in which the uncharged glycine at residue 1809 was replaced with alanine	 arginine and lysine. The side-chain of alanine is a small uncharged methyl group	 while both arginine and lysine have bulky	 positively charged side-chains (see supplementary material	 Figure S7B). We hypothesized that G1809A	 an amino acid substitution that does not change the charge of the side-chain and was not seen in tumours	 would not interfere with DICER1 function	 whereas both tumour-associated G1809R and the similarly charged G1809K substitution would disrupt the enzymatic activity of the RNase IIIb domain	 leading to loss of 5p miRNAs. The small RNA sequencing results revealed thatâ€‰âˆ¼â€‰50% of total miRNAs are 5p miRNAs in DKO172 cells expressing WT DICER1 or G1809A	 while the 5p miRNA population was drastically reduced toâ€‰<â€‰20% of total miRNAs in cells expressing G1809R or G1809K	 similar to the cells expressing a bona fide hotspot mutant D1709N (Figure 4C). The global reduction of miRNA species in all sequencing reads was mainly due to the loss of 5p miRNAs (see supplementary material	 Figure S7C). We also observed a partial decrease of 3p miRNAs in cells expressing hotspot mutants	 which agrees with a previous finding [12]. To confirm the results from small RNA sequencing	 we examined the expression of individual miRNAs	 using real-time PCR. Complete loss of 5p miRNAs	 ie let-7c and miR-99b	 and partial reduction of 3p miRNAs	 ie miR-22 and miR-27	 were observed in DKO172 cells expressing G1809R	 G1809K or D1709N mutants (Figure 4D	 E). Therefore	 our data demonstrated that a positively charged side-chain at residue 1809 would have detrimental effects on the cleavage of 5p miRNAs from precursor miRNAs. DICER1 hotspot mutation affects downstream pathways associated with cell proliferation  Loss of miRNAs should	 in part	 directly de-repress mRNA levels and therefore lead to increased target gene expression. In order to understand the impact of losing 5p miRNAs on downstream cell signalling pathways	 we profiled mRNA expression in DKO172 cells expressing WT DICER1 or mutants. Consistent with previous results	 two DICER1 hotspot mutants	 D1709N and G1809R	 clustered together by unsupervised hierarchical clustering	 indicating that they have very similar expression profiles and are functionally equivalent (Figure 5A). Furthermore	 DICER1 mutants were clustered further away from WT DICER1 than the GFP control	 indicating that the gene expression profiles of hotspot mutants are more similar to the profile of Dicer1-null than to that of WT DICER1 (Figure 5A). To identify genes differentially expressed due to hotspot mutations	 gene expression profiles of D1709N and G1809R were compared to that of WT; > 90% of up-regulated genes (fold changeâ€‰â‰¥â€‰2) in D1709N and G1809R were the same when compared to WT (Figure 5B)	 supporting the notion that the two DICER1 mutants function alike. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used to analyse the cellular functions of 832 genes that were up-regulated in both mutants	 and revealed that the most significantly enriched gene ontology categories were associated with cell cycle progression (Table 2; see also supplementary material	 Table S5).

WT DICER1 strongly repressed cell proliferation	 whereas the D1709N and G1809R mutants displayed a moderate growth advantage over Dicer1-null cells expressing the GFP control (Figure 5C). This is in agreement with the data showing that DICER1 hotspot mutations up-regulate genes promoting cell proliferation (Table 2). Therefore	 our data suggest that hotspot mutations impair the tumour-suppressive effect of DICER1 in DKO172 cells.  Studies have shown that the miRNA seed sequence	 nucleotides 2â€“7 from the 5â€² end of a miRNA	 is essential for target recognition [24	 25]. Many miRNA genes have multiple isoforms that share conserved seed regions and can be grouped into specific miRNA families. Based on miRNA seed sequences	 Ingenuity Pathway Analysis predicted that the let-7 family is a key regulator and directly regulates 53/832 genes that were up-regulated in cells expressing DICER1 hotspot mutants (see supplementary material	 Table S6). This is not surprising	 because the let-7 family	 composed of let-7-a1 	 âˆ’a2 	 âˆ’b 	 âˆ’c1 	 âˆ’c2 	 âˆ’d 	 âˆ’e 	 âˆ’f1 	 âˆ’f2 	 âˆ’g 	 âˆ’i and miR-98 (www.targetscan.org)	 is the most abundant 5p miRNA family in DKO172 cells expressing WT DICER1 and is completely lost in hotspot mutant-expressing cells (Figure 5D; see also supplementary material	 Figure S9). The let-7 family miRNAs are well known tumour suppressors that repress cell proliferation pathways [26]. Targets of let-7 that were increased in DICER1 hotspot mutants	 such as CDC25A	 CCNA2	 CCNE1	 CDK1	 SKP2	 LIN28A/B	 etc.	 are important regulators of cell cycle progression. Discussion  In this study	 we report that DICER1 hotspot mutations are present in âˆ¼2% of endometrial tumours. This is consistent across both the TCGA dataset (7/304) and our own local tumour bank (6/290; see supplementary material	 Tables S1	 S7). DICER1 hotspot mutations	 although rare	 were also identified in brain	 colorectal and thyroid cancers (see supplementary material	 Table S1). Aksoy and colleagues [27] also reported similar results using data from the TCGA in a preprint when we were preparing this manuscript. Together	 our findings suggest that the DICER1 hotspot mutations may impact tumourigenesis beyond the spectrum of rare paediatric cancers [8-13	 15-18]. DICER1 hotspot mutations and subsequent miRNA/mRNA dysregulation may therefore constitute a common oncogenic pathway in a small subset of endometrial tumours.  We identified a recurrent G1809R DICER1 mutation	 which is located at a highly conserved site and is in close spatial proximity to the metal-binding residues (E1810 and D1813) in the RNase IIIb domain of DICER1. During the preparation of our manuscript	 several studies identified G1809R mutations in both PPB and Wilms' tumour [16	 28-30] and a G1809V mutation in Wilms' tumour [30]. We demonstrated that the G1809R mutation impairs 5p miRNA production in vitro with RNA cleavage assays (Figure 4). We characterized the impact of G1809R on miRNA production in an isogenic cell line model	 and confirmed that G1809R is functionally equivalent to previously characterized hotspot mutations [4	11	 12]. We also found that not all mutations at residue 1809 will impair RNase IIIb cleavage activity; for example	 substituting glycine with alanine	 a small uncharged residue	 did not impair miRNA processing	 while the substitution of large positively charged residues	 such as arginine or lysine	 led to loss of 5p miRNA production (Figure 4). In one case	 G1809R was compound heterozygous with a germline S839F mutation. This is of particular interest	 because the heterozygous S839F DICER1 mutation has been reported to be highly penetrant in a large family with MNG [7]. Western blot results suggested that ectopic expression of S839F mutant reduces DICER1 protein levels (see supplementary material	 Figure S4)	 and thus may produce a hypomorphic phenotype in vivo	 although the detailed mechanism of this mutation warrants further investigation.  In summary	 we have shown that four of seven tumours with DICER1 hotspot mutations potentially fitted the two-hit hypothesis for DICER1 involvement in tumourigenesis. In the TCGA endometrial cohort	 five of six cases with hotspot mutations possessed additional DICER1 mutations (see supplementary material	 Table S1). However	 whether those mutations were in trans or deleterious remained to be determined. No loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was observed in tumours with DICER1 hotspot mutations (see supplementary material	 Figure S8). Overall	 down-regulation of 5p miRNAs was observed in tumours with DICER1 hotspot mutations (Figure 3A; see also supplementary material	 Figure S5). The 5p miRNA abundance in the total miRNA population was lower in tumours with 'two-hit' (meanâ€‰Â±â€‰SEâ€‰=â€‰57.5â€‰Â±â€‰7.8; nâ€‰=â€‰4) compared to its level in tumours with a single hotspot hit (meanâ€‰Â±â€‰SEâ€‰=â€‰68â€‰Â±â€‰6; nâ€‰=â€‰3). However	 the difference was not significant (pâ€‰=â€‰0.36)	 which may be due to the limited sample size. Future studies are needed to address whether hotspot alleles can compete with WT alleles for miRNA processing.  Early mouse models suggested that Dicer1 might function as a haplo-insufficient tumour-suppressor gene	 in that loss of a single allele of Dicer1 promotes tumour formation but loss of both alleles stalls tumour development in an oncogenic Kras or retinoblastoma-sensitized background [31	 32]. Initial clinical studies found that PPB and PPBâ€“FTDS patients carry heterozygous DICER1 germline mutations and no homozygous loss of DICER1 was observed [6	 33]	 which supported the DICER1 haplo-insufficiency hypothesis. However	 this model was contradicted by recent studies showing that Dicer1-null cells (KrasG12DTrp53 âˆ’/ âˆ’Dicer1 âˆ’/ âˆ’) from a mouse sarcoma cell line are competent for tumour formation	 and that Pten/Dicer1 double-knockout mice develop primary fallopian tube tumours [17	 34]. These divergent results suggest that the DICER1 haplo-insufficiency hypothesis may only apply to specific tissues or tumour models.  The two-hit hypothesis for DICER1 was initially proposed after identification of DICER1 hotspot mutations in tumours from PPB and PPBâ€“FTDS patients with germline DICER1 mutations [11	13	 29]. More recently	 frequent biallelic DICER1 mutations were identified in sporadic (8/11) and germline PPB (12/12) from two independent studies [16	 28]. The biallelic DICER1 mutations predominantly involved a loss-of-function mutation in one allele and a hotspot mutation in the other allele	 although homozygous hotspot mutations were observed in two sporadic PPB cases [28] and complete loss of functional DICER1 was reported in several pineoblastomas [10	 35]. Mosaic germline DICER1 hotspot mutations were associated with a novel human overgrowth syndrome [36]	 suggesting that a DICER1 hotspot mutation may be oncogenic regardless of the presence of WT DICER1. Transgenic animal models are needed to delineate the oncogenic effects of DICER1 hotspot mutations in future studies.  The recurrent DICER1 hotspot mutations act more like oncogenic gain-of-function than loss-of-function mutations. Using a Dicer1/Pten double-knockout murine fallopian tumour cell model	 we demonstrated that DICER1 hotspot mutations provide a growth advantage over Dicer1-null cells	 in stark contrast to the repressive effects of WT DICER1. Genes de-repressed in DICER1 mutants	 of which many are targets of the let-7 family miRNAs	 were enriched in pathways associated with cell cycle progression (Table 2). Our data agree with previous speculation that loss of let-7	 a well-known tumour suppressor	 might have a profound impact on downstream pathways [4	 12].  More than 50000 women were diagnosed with endometrial cancer in the USA in 2014 (http://www.cancer.gov/). Although DICER1 hotspot mutations are found inâ€‰âˆ¼â€‰2% of endometrial cancers	 they could affect a substantial number of patients (âˆ¼1000 cases/year). Our finding suggests that defects in the miRNA processing pathway may provide a new prospect for drug development and cancer therapy beyond rare paediatric cancers. 																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												
1	37||Sex cordâ€“stromal tumors and germ-cell tumors account for less than 10% of ovarian cancers.1 Unlike epithelial ovarian cancers	 both sex cordâ€“stromal tumors and germ-cell tumors can also occur in the testicle; testicular germ-cell tumors are the most common cancer in boys and men of European descent between the ages of 15 and 34 years.2	3 Other than a pathognomonic somatic mutation in FOXL2 in adult granulosa-cell tumors	4-6 little is known about the pathogenesis of ovarian sex cordâ€“stromal tumors and germ-cell tumors. Recently	 germline mutations in the microRNA processing gene DICER1 have been reported in probands with pleuropulmonary blastoma or the related familial tumor dysplasia syndrome	 known as pleuropulmonary blastomaâ€“family tumor and dysplasia syndrome (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man [OMIM] number	 601200)	 which includes cystic nephroma	 ovarian sex cordâ€“stromal tumor (especially Sertoliâ€“Leydig cell tumor)	 and multinodular goiter.7 MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a functional class of noncoding RNA molecules that regulate translation and degradation of messenger RNA.8	9 MiRNA transcripts are processed from hairpin pre-miRNA precursors into short miRNA:miRNA* duplexes consisting of the miRNA targeting strand and the imperfectly complementary miRNA* strand (star strand	 or inert carrier strand) by Dicer	 an endoribonuclease with two RNase IIIâ€“like domains. The RNase IIIb domain cuts the miRNA strand	 whereas the RNase IIIa domain cleaves the miRNA* strand.10	11 The resultant RNA duplex is loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) containing an Argonaute protein. The miRNA* strand is then removed	 leaving the miRNA strand	 which targets messenger RNAs for degradation or interacts with the translation initiation complex to inhibit and destabilize translation of the targeted messenger RNAs.12	13 The expression levels of Dicer have global effects on the biogenesis of miRNA	 and reduced expression correlates with a poor outcome in many cancers.7	14-18 In mouse models of cancer	 the loss of a single Dicer1 allele (haploinsufficiency) reduced the time to tumor onset19 or survival time	20 as compared with control animals. Experimental data support the hypothesis that the pathogenicity of aberrations in Dicer function is dependent on the cellular context and that the activation or inhibition of pathways for tissue-specific development and differentiation are at least partially controlled by specific miRNAs or miRNA families.7	8	21 In mouse models with urogenital-specific knockout of Dicer1	 there is evidence of apoptosis of germ cells and Sertoli cells22-24 but no induction of a tumorigenic phenotype. Outside the urogenital tract	 impaired differentiation occurs with Dicer loss25-27 but requires a further challenge for oncogenesis.19	20 In this study	 we report recurrent somatic missense mutations of DICER1 that implicate a defect in miRNA processing	 not as a permissive event in tumor onset (as might be expected for loss of function in a tumor suppressor) but rather as an oncogenic event in the specific context of nonepithelial ovarian tumors. METHODS Experimental Data The methodologic details of all experiments that we conducted are provided in the Supplementary Appendix	 available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. Tumor Samples The 14 discovery samples included juvenile-type granulosa-cell tumors	 primitive germ-cell tumors of the yolk-sac type	 and Sertoliâ€“Leydig cell tumors from the Children's Oncology Group at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus	 Ohio	 and the Ovarian Cancer Research Program (OvCaRe) tissue bank in Vancouver	 British Columbia	 Canada. Both resources provide access to samples through specific application to studies approved by institutional review boards	 including next-generation sequencing studies. We used 411 additional tumor samples for validation. Transcriptome	 Exome	 and Sanger Sequencing We carried out transcriptome sequencing and analysis as described previously.4	28	29 We performed exome capture of genomic coding regions through solution hybrid selection.30 Raw data were deposited at the European Genomeâ€“Phenome Archive (accession number	 EGAS00001000135). We performed Sanger sequencing in the region of DICER1 encoding the RNase IIIb domain in DNA from samples in both the discovery and validation series and in germline DNA	 when available. DICER1 Enzyme Assay We incubated wild-type DICER1 protein	 mutants	 and controls with 5â€²-32phosphate (32P)â€“labeled RNA oligonucleotide substrates and analyzed the cleavage products by means of gel electrophoresis and phosphorimaging. RESULTS Somatic Mutations in DICER1 Using a combination of whole-transcriptome and whole-exome sequencing	 we looked for genomic aberrations in two Sertoliâ€“Leydig cell tumors	 four juvenile granulosa-cell tumors	 and eight primitive germ-cell tumors of the yolk-sac type (Tables 1 and 2 in the Supplementary Appendix). We discovered four nonsynonymous missense mutations in DICER1 affecting the D1709 residue	 one nonsense truncating mutation	 and one insertion mutation that was predicted to result in a frameshift and truncation (Figure 1FIGURE 1 Mutations in DICER1.). All mutations were validated by means of Sanger sequencing. The D1709 residue is within a cluster of acidic residues that are responsible for metal binding10	11 in the catalytic center of the RNase IIIb domain (Fig. 1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Despite adequate sequence coverage	 we observed no mutations that were predicted to affect the RNase IIIa domain (Fig. 2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Sequence-read data (Table 1 in the Supplementary Appendix) and Sanger traces from mutant DICER1 samples confirmed that all mutations were heterozygous. Copy-number analysis confirmed that only a single sample	 PGCTYS-05 with wild-type DICER1	 showed heterozygous loss around DICER1 (Fig. 3 in the Supplementary Appendix). DICER1 Mutations in the Validation Set The recurrent D1709 mutations in our discovery set seemed likely to have an effect on cleavage of miRNAs and metal (Mg2+/Mn2+) binding and are thus potentially pathogenic.10	11 We performed Sanger sequencing encompassing the regions encoding all four metal-binding residues within the RNase IIIb domain in a validation set that included 101 additional nonepithelial ovarian tumors (Table 1TABLE 1 Prevalence of Somatic Hot-Spot Mutations Affecting the RNase IIIb Domain of DICER1 in Nonepithelial Ovarian Tumors.	 and Tables 3	4	 and 5 in the Supplementary Appendix). We also screened 39 testicular tumors to determine whether they harbored the same mutations. Among the nonepithelial ovarian tumor types that were screened	 mutations affecting any one metal-binding residue were present	 with the highest prevalence in Sertoliâ€“Leydig cell tumors: 26 of 43 (60%) of these tumors harbored a mutation. We designated these mutations affecting RNase IIIb metal-binding residues as hot spots. Apart from ovarian sex cordâ€“stromal tumors and germ-cell tumors	 1 of 14 single	 developmentally related	 nonseminomatous testicular germ-cell tumors harbored a D1709N mutation (Table 3 in the Supplementary Appendix). To determine whether these mutations occur in other cancers with a so-called primitive phenotype	 we analyzed 5 embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas; 2 of these tumors had hot-spot mutations	 1 of which occurred in a patient with a previously described germline mutation.31 We found hot-spot mutations in 33 of 159 tumors in the discovery and validation sets combined	 including ovarian	 testicular	 and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma tumor types. Among these mutations	 the most prevalent were the 17 mutations affecting D1709. We confirmed that mutations were somatic in 16 cases for which we had corresponding germline DNA. We attempted to assess all hot-spot regions by performing Sanger sequencing of two independent amplicons spanning the metal-binding residues (for details	 see the Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix). However	 because of poor preservation of DNA in formalin-fixed	 paraffin-embedded material	 in some instances we could sequence only a single amplicon (4 mutation-positive samples and 18 mutation-negative samples) (Table 3 in the Supplementary Appendix). In cases in which both amplicon regions were successfully sequenced	 mutations affecting any one RNase IIIb metal-binding residue were mutually exclusive with mutations affecting any other IIIb metal-binding residue (P<0.01 by Fisher's exact tests) (Fig. 4 in the Supplementary Appendix). We observed no mutations affecting the metal-binding regions of the RNase IIIa domain	 despite targeted sequencing of 4 samples that were positive for an RNase IIIb mutation and 9 samples that were mutation-negative. Immunohistochemical analysis did not provide a proxy for hot-spot mutation status	 since all tumors were positive for DICER1 expression (Fig. 5 in the Supplementary Appendix). The DICER1 hot-spot mutations are not present in the 1000 Genomes Project data or the public-data repository of the Cancer Genome Atlas consortium. No recurrent DICER1 mutations have been reported in the mutation database of the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC)	 in which 4 of 938 cancers have somatic mutations but none in the RNase IIIb hot spots or RNase IIIa equivalents.32 Moreover	 these mutations were not observed in any of the more than 1000 cancer-sequencing libraries that we studied or in 15 adult granulosa-cell tumors with FOXL2 mutations from our validation cohort. On the basis of reported DICER1 dysfunction in epithelial ovarian cancers	14 we further analyzed a series of 266 epithelial ovarian and endometrial cancers and observed a somatic hot-spot mutation (c.5676Gâ†’A	 encoding an E1813G substitution) in a single ovarian carcinosarcoma (Table 4 in the Supplementary Appendix). Compound DICER1 Mutations Across our discovery and validation series	 seven samples had a hot-spot mutation and an additional germline or somatic DICER1 mutation (Table 2TABLE 2 Patients with a Hot-Spot Mutation and an Additional Germline or Somatic DICER1 Mutation.	 and Table 3 in the Supplementary Appendix). To show that the specific hot-spot DICER1 somatic mutation was a separate hit on a different allele from the germline mutation	 we cloned and sequenced complementary DNA (cDNA) from sample SLCT-19	 which had a germline DICER1 deletion (5018-5021delTCAA). The primers for the reverse-transcriptaseâ€“polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay were chosen to allow capture of both the germline and somatic changes in a single amplicon	 should the two changes exist in cis with one another (Figure 2FIGURE 2 Germline Mutations of DICER1 in Trans with Somatic Hot-Spot Mutations.). Only the allele with the hot-spot mutation was observed	 a finding consistent with a lymphoblastoid cell line derived from the same person in which transcripts containing the germline variant have been shown to undergo nonsense-mediated decay of messenger RNA.33 Using this RT-PCR strategy	 we further showed that hot-spot mutations in three other samples were in trans with a separate DICER1 mutation	 and expression of the allele with the hot-spot mutation was predominant (Table 2	 and Fig. 6 in the Supplementary Appendix). Although it is possible that mutation of the nonâ€“hot-spot allele was present in other tumors from this study	 because of the generally poor quality of DNA from formalin-fixed	 paraffin-embedded samples	 screening of the entire DICER1 sequence was not performed. Functional Characterization of DICER1 Mutants We carried out RNA cleavage assays to compare the activity of DICER1 proteins containing the hot-spot D1709N	 D1709E	 and E1705K substitutions with that of wild-type and control samples	 including a D1709A mutant with greatly reduced RNase IIIb activity that shows total loss of DICER1 function only if a substitution in the RNase IIIa domain is also present10	11 (Figure 3FIGURE 3 Functional Characterization of DICER1 Mutations In Vitro.). Wild-type DICER1 (including ectopic	 endogenous	 and commercially obtained forms) generated products of 18 and 22 nucleotides (Figure 3B	 and Fig. 7 in the Supplementary Appendix). These products correspond to those of enzymatic cleavage that produce a mature miRNA duplex (Figure 3A)	 whereas the D1709A enzyme generated only the 18-nucleotide product	 as expected.10	11 This finding indicates that the 22-nucleotide band is derived from activity at the RNase IIIb site	 whereas the 18-nucleotide band is related to activity at the RNase IIIa site. The hot-spot mutant DICER1 proteins yielded markedly low levels of the 22-nucleotide product and substantial levels of the 18-nucleotide product	 suggesting that	 like the D1709A mutation	 the D1709N	 D1709E	 and E1705K substitutions result in reduced RNase IIIb activity but retention of RNase IIIa activity. Preliminary analysis of miRNA expression in four Sertoliâ€“Leydig cell tumors with DICER1 hot-spot mutations had similar overall mature or processed miRNA expression levels as a Sertoliâ€“Leydig cell tumor with no mutation in DICER1 (Fig. 8 in the Supplementary Appendix). Three of these Sertoliâ€“Leydig cell tumors had second-allele nonâ€“hot-spot mutations	 two of which were known to be truncating (Table 2). Thus	 miRNA processing in the latter two Sertoliâ€“Leydig cell tumors probably occurs through the hot-spot mutant DICER1	 in which case tumors with mutant and nonmutant versions of DICER1 have similar levels of miRNA-processing activity. DISCUSSION The hot-spot DICER1 mutations that we report here are predominantly restricted to a specific subset of nonepithelial ovarian tumors and are highly prevalent (60%) in Sertoliâ€“Leydig cell tumors. We also observed hot-spot mutations in a single high-grade ovarian carcinosarcoma	 one testicular germ-cell tumor	 and two embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas. The presence of these recurrent mutations in tumors that have an embryonal or primitive appearance suggests that their pathogenicity may be restricted to specific cell types or developmental settings. Generally	 though	 somatic mutations in DICER1 in patients with cancer are rare. A survey of cancer cell lines showed that 4 of 781 had truncating changes in DICER1.34 It is not clear whether these mutations were germline or somatic	 but all occurred in microsatellite-unstable lines	 suggesting limited relevance to carcinogenesis. Somatic mutations in DICER1 (albeit not the hot-spot mutations described here) have been reported in a single patient with prostate cancer35 and in two patients with epithelial ovarian cancers.14 Germline truncating DICER1 mutations have been reported in children with pleuropulmonary blastoma or a family history of the disease and related disorders	 including families with Sertoliâ€“Leydig cell tumors7 or ovarian sex cordâ€“stromal tumors with or without a history of pleuropulmonary blastoma.36 Among 823 patients with a variety of primitive tumors	 there was a low prevalence of germline DICER1 mutations that are likely to cause loss of function.34 None of these germline mutations involved the hot-spot locations that we report here or appeared to cluster within narrow regions. Retention of the wild-type DICER1 allele has been reported in the context of these germline loss-of-function mutations in all cases in which loss-of-heterozygosity studies were performed.7 It is possible that undetected hot-spot mutations were present on the ostensibly wild-type allele in these tumors. The recurrent and focal nature of the mutations and their restriction to nonepithelial ovarian tumors suggest a common oncogenic mechanism associated with a specific altered DICER1 function that is selected during tumor development in these cell types. This hypothesis is supported by several other observations. First	 the in vitro biochemical data support impaired RNase IIIb activity and retention of RNase IIIa activity in tumors with hot-spot mutations. The fact that the RNase IIIa domain appears to be unaffected by mutations in the tumors that have been screened so far suggests that biologic activity in tumors with hot-spot mutations could be associated with the retained activity of the RNase IIIa site or the RISC loading function of DICER1. Second	 DICER1 protein with hot-spot mutations appears to be capable of miRNA processing. We observed a second mutation in seven tumors with hot-spot mutations	 and in six of these samples	 the nonâ€“hot-spot mutated allele was predicted to be null. Thus	 any DICER1-associated miRNA biogenesis in these six tumors was probably due to the activity of DICER1 with a hot-spot mutation. Although a global reduction in miRNA expression is one potential effect of the hot-spot mutation	 our analysis suggests that a total loss of miRNA biogenesis is highly unlikely. Finally	 DICER1 expression in tumors with hot-spot mutations argues against a role for DICER1 as a classic two-hit tumor suppressor. The localized and focal pattern of mutation is typical of dominantly acting oncogenes	 like KRAS and BRAF. The absence of loss of heterozygosity that is seen in association with germline DICER1 mutations provides further evidence against a role for DICER1 as either a haploinsufficient or a two-hit recessive tumor suppressor. Our findings suggest that DICER1 alleles with hot-spot mutations produce viable protein. The hot-spot mutations appear to represent a new class in which the loss of the wild-type allele may occur in tandem with the retention of a hot-spot mutant DICER1 protein. We hypothesize that an oncogenic miRNA profile is derived from altered DICER1 activity in the RNase IIIb domain. Furthermore	 such activity may result in a positive bias toward the processing or selection of the RNase IIIaâ€“processed strand of the miRNA duplex (the miRNA* strand)	 which is consistent with the finding that the ability of DICER1 to load miRNA into RISC does not depend on the integrity of its RNase III domains.37 Recent studies suggest that miRNA* species may be important in gene regulation rather than simply being an inert strand.38	39 This hypothesis is consistent with the known importance of specific miRNAs in cell differentiation and cell-fate determination	 although the mechanisms by which RNase IIIb hot-spot mutations affect miRNA processing or RISC loading in the context of cancer development warrants further investigation. We conclude that in a range of nonepithelial ovarian cancers	 and potentially other cancers	 aberrant miRNA processing resulting from DICER1 hot-spot mutations is a key oncogenic event.  																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										
1	38||Sex cordâ€“stromal tumors and germ-cell tumors account for less than 10% of ovarian cancers.1 Unlike epithelial ovarian cancers	 both sex cordâ€“stromal tumors and germ-cell tumors can also occur in the testicle; testicular germ-cell tumors are the most common cancer in boys and men of European descent between the ages of 15 and 34 years.2	3 Other than a pathognomonic somatic mutation in FOXL2 in adult granulosa-cell tumors	4-6 little is known about the pathogenesis of ovarian sex cordâ€“stromal tumors and germ-cell tumors. Recently	 germline mutations in the microRNA processing gene DICER1 have been reported in probands with pleuropulmonary blastoma or the related familial tumor dysplasia syndrome	 known as pleuropulmonary blastomaâ€“family tumor and dysplasia syndrome (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man [OMIM] number	 601200)	 which includes cystic nephroma	 ovarian sex cordâ€“stromal tumor (especially Sertoliâ€“Leydig cell tumor)	 and multinodular goiter.7 MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a functional class of noncoding RNA molecules that regulate translation and degradation of messenger RNA.8	9 MiRNA transcripts are processed from hairpin pre-miRNA precursors into short miRNA:miRNA* duplexes consisting of the miRNA targeting strand and the imperfectly complementary miRNA* strand (star strand	 or inert carrier strand) by Dicer	 an endoribonuclease with two RNase IIIâ€“like domains. The RNase IIIb domain cuts the miRNA strand	 whereas the RNase IIIa domain cleaves the miRNA* strand.10	11 The resultant RNA duplex is loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) containing an Argonaute protein. The miRNA* strand is then removed	 leaving the miRNA strand	 which targets messenger RNAs for degradation or interacts with the translation initiation complex to inhibit and destabilize translation of the targeted messenger RNAs.12	13 The expression levels of Dicer have global effects on the biogenesis of miRNA	 and reduced expression correlates with a poor outcome in many cancers.7	14-18 In mouse models of cancer	 the loss of a single Dicer1 allele (haploinsufficiency) reduced the time to tumor onset19 or survival time	20 as compared with control animals. Experimental data support the hypothesis that the pathogenicity of aberrations in Dicer function is dependent on the cellular context and that the activation or inhibition of pathways for tissue-specific development and differentiation are at least partially controlled by specific miRNAs or miRNA families.7	8	21 In mouse models with urogenital-specific knockout of Dicer1	 there is evidence of apoptosis of germ cells and Sertoli cells22-24 but no induction of a tumorigenic phenotype. Outside the urogenital tract	 impaired differentiation occurs with Dicer loss25-27 but requires a further challenge for oncogenesis.19	20 In this study	 we report recurrent somatic missense mutations of DICER1 that implicate a defect in miRNA processing	 not as a permissive event in tumor onset (as might be expected for loss of function in a tumor suppressor) but rather as an oncogenic event in the specific context of nonepithelial ovarian tumors. METHODS Experimental Data The methodologic details of all experiments that we conducted are provided in the Supplementary Appendix	 available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. Tumor Samples The 14 discovery samples included juvenile-type granulosa-cell tumors	 primitive germ-cell tumors of the yolk-sac type	 and Sertoliâ€“Leydig cell tumors from the Children's Oncology Group at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus	 Ohio	 and the Ovarian Cancer Research Program (OvCaRe) tissue bank in Vancouver	 British Columbia	 Canada. Both resources provide access to samples through specific application to studies approved by institutional review boards	 including next-generation sequencing studies. We used 411 additional tumor samples for validation. Transcriptome	 Exome	 and Sanger Sequencing We carried out transcriptome sequencing and analysis as described previously.4	28	29 We performed exome capture of genomic coding regions through solution hybrid selection.30 Raw data were deposited at the European Genomeâ€“Phenome Archive (accession number	 EGAS00001000135). We performed Sanger sequencing in the region of DICER1 encoding the RNase IIIb domain in DNA from samples in both the discovery and validation series and in germline DNA	 when available. DICER1 Enzyme Assay We incubated wild-type DICER1 protein	 mutants	 and controls with 5â€²-32phosphate (32P)â€“labeled RNA oligonucleotide substrates and analyzed the cleavage products by means of gel electrophoresis and phosphorimaging. RESULTS Somatic Mutations in DICER1 Using a combination of whole-transcriptome and whole-exome sequencing	 we looked for genomic aberrations in two Sertoliâ€“Leydig cell tumors	 four juvenile granulosa-cell tumors	 and eight primitive germ-cell tumors of the yolk-sac type (Tables 1 and 2 in the Supplementary Appendix). We discovered four nonsynonymous missense mutations in DICER1 affecting the D1709 residue	 one nonsense truncating mutation	 and one insertion mutation that was predicted to result in a frameshift and truncation (Figure 1FIGURE 1 Mutations in DICER1.). All mutations were validated by means of Sanger sequencing. The D1709 residue is within a cluster of acidic residues that are responsible for metal binding10	11 in the catalytic center of the RNase IIIb domain (Fig. 1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Despite adequate sequence coverage	 we observed no mutations that were predicted to affect the RNase IIIa domain (Fig. 2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Sequence-read data (Table 1 in the Supplementary Appendix) and Sanger traces from mutant DICER1 samples confirmed that all mutations were heterozygous. Copy-number analysis confirmed that only a single sample	 PGCTYS-05 with wild-type DICER1	 showed heterozygous loss around DICER1 (Fig. 3 in the Supplementary Appendix). DICER1 Mutations in the Validation Set The recurrent D1709 mutations in our discovery set seemed likely to have an effect on cleavage of miRNAs and metal (Mg2+/Mn2+) binding and are thus potentially pathogenic.10	11 We performed Sanger sequencing encompassing the regions encoding all four metal-binding residues within the RNase IIIb domain in a validation set that included 101 additional nonepithelial ovarian tumors (Table 1TABLE 1 Prevalence of Somatic Hot-Spot Mutations Affecting the RNase IIIb Domain of DICER1 in Nonepithelial Ovarian Tumors.	 and Tables 3	4	 and 5 in the Supplementary Appendix). We also screened 39 testicular tumors to determine whether they harbored the same mutations. Among the nonepithelial ovarian tumor types that were screened	 mutations affecting any one metal-binding residue were present	 with the highest prevalence in Sertoliâ€“Leydig cell tumors: 26 of 43 (60%) of these tumors harbored a mutation. We designated these mutations affecting RNase IIIb metal-binding residues as hot spots. Apart from ovarian sex cordâ€“stromal tumors and germ-cell tumors	 1 of 14 single	 developmentally related	 nonseminomatous testicular germ-cell tumors harbored a D1709N mutation (Table 3 in the Supplementary Appendix). To determine whether these mutations occur in other cancers with a so-called primitive phenotype	 we analyzed 5 embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas; 2 of these tumors had hot-spot mutations	 1 of which occurred in a patient with a previously described germline mutation.31 We found hot-spot mutations in 33 of 159 tumors in the discovery and validation sets combined	 including ovarian	 testicular	 and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma tumor types.

4	39||Human Dicer contains two RNase III domains (RNase IIIa and RNase IIIb) that are responsible for the production of short interfering RNAs and microRNAs. These small RNAs induce gene silencing known as RNA interference. Here	 we report the crystal structure of the C-terminal RNase III domain (RNase IIIb) of human Dicer at 2.0 Ã… resolution. The structure revealed that the RNase IIIb domain can form a tightly associated homodimer	 which is similar to the dimers of the bacterial RNase III domains and the two RNase III domains of Giardia Dicer. Biochemical analysis showed that the RNase IIIb homodimer can cleave double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs)	 and generate short dsRNAs with 2 nt 3â€² overhang	 which is characteristic of RNase III products. The RNase IIIb domain contained two magnesium ions per monomer around the active site. The distance between two Mg-1 ions is approximately 20.6 Ã…	 almost identical with those observed in bacterial RNase III enzymes and Giardia Dicer	 while the locations of two Mg-2 ions were not conserved at all. We presume that Mg-1 ions act as catalysts for dsRNA cleavage	 while Mg-2 ions are involved in RNA binding.  Abbreviations used dsRNA	 double-stranded RNA; Ec	 Escherichia coli; Gi	 Giardia intestinalis; dsRBD	 dsRNA-binding domain; Aa	 Aquifex aeolicus; Mtb	 Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Tm	 Thermotoga maritima Keywords RNA interference; Dicer; RNase III enzyme; dsRNA; metal-binding protein Introduction In many eukaryotic cells	 small RNAs trigger gene silencing in a sequence-specific manner. Dicer is responsible for the processing of long double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) into short interfering RNAs	 and for the processing of precursor microRNAs into microRNAs.1	2 These small RNAs provide specificity to protein effector complexes that repress mRNA transcription or translation	 or that catalyze mRNA degradation.1	2  Dicer homologues have been found in all eukaryotes studied	 except for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In zebrafish and mouse	 the Dicer protein is essential to normal development. 3	4 In Arabidopsis thaliana	 mutants of dicer-like 1 (DCL1) show various phenotypic defects. 5 Analysis of recombinant human (Homo sapiens	 Hs) Dicer indicated that the enzyme generates short interfering RNAs s from dsRNA	6	7 and that it produces the mature let-7 RNA from the microRNA let-7 precursor.6 Dicers are approximately 200 kDa multidomain proteins that consist of an N-terminal DEXH-box helicase/ATPase domain	 a domain of unknown function (DUF283)	 a PAZ domain	 two RNase III nuclease domains (RNase IIIa and RNase IIIb)	 and a dsRNA-binding domain (dsRBD). RNase III domain of Dicer appears to interact with the PIWI domain of Argonaute proteins in cells.8	9 Thus	 the Dicer interactions with PIWI domains are considered to be involved in a substrate transfer.10  RNase III proteins are divided into three classes	 and classes 1	2	 and 3 are represented by Escherichia coli (Ec) RNase III	 Drosha	 and Dicer	 respectively. 11	12 Class 1 enzymes have one RNase III domain	 whereas class 2 and class 3 enzymes have two RNase III domains (Figure 1(a)). To our knowledge	 there is no report of the presence of class 1 enzymes in mammals. Biochemical and structural studies indicated that class 1 enzymes function as homodimers.11	12In vitro mutational analysis and gradient sedimentation analysis using recombinant Dicer have indicated the validity of a single processing center model for Hs-Dicer	 which suggests that RNase IIIa and RNase IIIb in a Dicer molecule form two catalytic sites through intramolecular dimerization	 analogous to the homodimerization of the bacterial RNase III. 13 In this model	 the two catalytic sites	 which cleave an RNA phosphodiester bond	 generate RNA products with 2 nt 3â€² overhangs. RBDs	 dsRBD and PAZ assist the cleavage reaction. Recently	 the crystal structure of a primitive form of Dicer from Giardia intestinalis (Gi) was determined and it was shown that two RNase III domains of Gi-Dicer are capable of forming an intramolecular heterodimer. 14  Domain structure of the RNase III superfamily and sequence alignment of RNase ... Figure 1.  Domain structure of the RNase III superfamily and sequence alignment of RNase III domains. (a) Three classes of the RNase III superfamily. Class 3 is represented by human Dicer	 class 2 by human Drosha	 and class 1 by bacterial RNase III proteins. The green box represents the helicase domain	 the yellow box represents DUF283 (domain of unknown function)	 the blue box represents the PAZ (Piwi/Argonaute/Zwille) domain	 the red box represents the RNase III nuclease domain (RNase III domain)	 and the purple box represents dsRBD (dsRNA-binding domain). Class 2 and class 3 RNase III proteins have two tandem RNase III domains	 RNase IIIa and RNase IIIb (RIIIa and RIIIb	 respectively). We have determined the homodimeric structure of the RNase IIIb domain of human Dicer.

Figure options RNase III enzymes require divalent metal ions	 with Mg2+ as the preferred species.12 The Mg2+-dependent activity of RNase III is consistent with that of Hs-Dicer.6	7 The crystal structure of the RNase III nuclease domain from Aquifex aeolicus (Aa)	 which is complexed with Mg2+ or Mn2+ in each monomer	 provided the first structural information for the active site.11	15 On the other hand	 kinetic and inhibitor analysis of Ec-RNase III indicates the involvement of two magnesium ions in RNA phosphodiester hydrolysis.16 The crystal structure of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) RNase III nuclease domain in its complex with two calcium ions per monomer showed that one calcium ion (Ca-A) binds at a position similar to that of the magnesium ion of Aa-RNase III	 and the second (Ca-2Â°) binds near the active site. 17 In the Gi-Dicer structure	 a second metal ion (M2) was observed in the active site	 which is assumed to play a direct role in catalysis.14 Recent structural analyses of RNase III enzymes have been summarized and reviewed. 18.; 19. ;  20.  Here	 we report the crystal structure of the RNase IIIb domain of Hs-Dicer at 2.0 Ã… resolution. The structure revealed that the RNase IIIb domain can form a tightly associated homodimer	 which is similar to the dimers of the bacterial RNase III domains and the two RNase III domains of Gi-Dicer. The RNase IIIb domain binds two magnesium ions per monomer at or near the active sites. Mg-1 is coordinated by three of four invariant amino acids	 and the distance between two Mg-1 ions in the homodimer is approximately 20.6 Ã…	 almost identical with those of dsRNA-free forms of RNase III proteins (20.2â€“21.6 Ã…). Further	 biochemical analysis indicated that the RNase IIIb homodimer can process dsRNAs into shorter dsRNAs similar in terminal structure and size to the products of bacterial RNase III enzymes.  Results Overall structure  The crystal structure of RNase IIIb has been determined at 2.0 Ã… resolution and refined to a crystallographic R-factor of 0.211 and Rfree of 0.234 (Table 1). The crystals of the RNase IIIb domain belonged to space group C2221	 and contained three molecules (molecules A	 B	 and C) of the RNase IIIb domain in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. The final model includes residues 1660â€“1779 and 1800â€“1850 for molecule A	 residues 1660â€“1779 and 1800â€“1849 for molecule B	 and residues 1660â€“1779 and 1800â€“1848 for molecule C. There is no electron density for residues 1780â€“1799 in any of three molecules. The three molecules are very similar	" and CÎ± atoms can be superimposed with root-mean-square (r.m.s.) deviations of âˆ¼0.4 Ã….  Table 1. Crystallographic data A.

The crystal structure of the RNase IIIb domain shows a tightly associated homodimer between molecules A and C	 and molecules B and Bâ€² (the homodimer between molecules B and Bâ€² is shown in Figure 2(a)). A negatively charged valley is generated by the dimerization of the RNase IIIb monomers (Figure 2(b))	 and four magnesium ions are located in the valley. The residues forming the valley are well-conserved among RNase III enzymes (Figure 2(c)).  Structure of the RNase IIIb domain of Hs-Dicer. (a) Stereoview of the ribbon ... Figure 2.

Figure options To date	 three structures of bacterial RNase III enzymes have been determined (Aa-RNase III11; Mtb-RNase III17; Thermotoga maritima (Tm) RNase III	 PDB ID 1O0W)	 and recently	 the structure of Gi-Dicer was determined.14 The backbone structure of the RNase IIIb domain monomer was superimposed on Aa-RNase III	 Mtb-RNase III	 and Tm-RNase III	 with r.m.s. deviations of 1.18 Ã… (for 125 CÎ± atoms)	 1.15 Ã… (for 127 CÎ± atoms)	 and 1.25 Ã… (for 126 CÎ± atoms)	 respectively	 and was superimposed on the RNase IIIa domain and the RNase IIIb domain of Gi-Dicer	 with r.m.s. deviations of 1.30 Ã… (for 96 CÎ± atoms) and 1.34 Ã… (for 106 CÎ± atoms)	 respectively (the superposition of RNase IIIb domains is shown in Figure 2(d)).  The helix Î±6 and the subsequent disordered region correspond to the insert region of the RNase III domains of Dicers (Figures 1(b) and 2(a)). In this region	 the RNase IIIa domain and RNase IIIb domain of Hs-Dicer encode 177 residues (residues 1374â€“1550) and 37 residues (residues 1763â€“1799)	 respectively.  Homodimerization of the RNase IIIb domain  The structure of the RNase IIIb domain shows a tightly associated homodimer. Gel-filtration chromatographic analysis indicated that the RNase IIIb domain exists as a stable dimer in solution (data not shown). The dimer interface is composed of the antiparallel helices Î±3 and Î±4	 the C terminus of Î±7	 and the N terminus of Î±8. Dimerization is accomplished primarily through hydrophobic interactions (Figure 3(a)). Three aromatic residues	 F1706	 Y1714 and Y1721	 contribute to the dimerization via hydrophobic interactions. F1706 interacts with T1717	 L1732 and R1736	 whereas Y1714 interacts with I1711 and L1827	 and Y1721 interacts with R1703 and L1707. These aromatic residues are buried along the dimer interface. Among RNase III proteins	 F1706 is highly conserved	 except for RNase IIIa domain. Y1721 is highly conserved as aromatic amino acids. Y1714 is highly conserved within RNase IIIb domains of Dicers ( Figure 1(b)). In the RNase IIIa domain of Hs-Dicer	 M1317	 H1325 and F1332 correspond to F1706	 Y1714 and Y1721	 respectively.

The pink broken line indicates the flexible region	 containing 20 amino acid residues. Figure options In addition to hydrophobic interactions	 hydrogen bonds are observed in the dimer interface. R1703 forms hydrogen bonds with the main-chain carbonyl groups of Y1721 and H1727. R1736 also forms a hydrogen bond with the main-chain carbonyl group of F1706. The hydroxyl group of Y1714 forms a hydrogen bond to the hydroxyl group of Y1820. R1703 is highly conserved	 while R1736 is conserved as basic amino acids	 Arg or Lys (Figure 1(b)). In the RNase IIIa domain of Hs-Dicer	 R1314	 H1325 and R1347	 respectively	 correspond to R1703	 Y1714 and R1736.  The homodimeric structure is similar to those of homodimers of bacterial RNase III proteins and a dimer of two RNase III domains of Gi-Dicer (Figure 3(b) and (c)). The dimer interface is composed mainly of two antiparallel Î±3 helices. These backbone structures are well superimposed with r.m.s. deviations of 0.4 â€“0.8 Ã… (Table 2)	 indicating the conservation of the dimer contact among bacterial RNase III homodimers	" Gi-Dicer RNase III heterodimer and Hs-Dicer RNase IIIb homodimer.

The N-terminal motif II (motif II-NT) is composed of the following sequence"	 PXLXXVIXXFVXFQ (1763â€“1776)	 and the C-terminal motif II (motif II-CT) is composed of the following sequence	 EDIEVP (1800â€“1805). The motif II-NT forms the helix Î±6	 which is anchored to the surface of the RNase III domain by hydrophobic interactions between L1765	 V1768	 I1769	 F1772	 V1773	 and F1775 of motif II-NT	 and I1802	 E1803	 and P1805 of motif II-CT ( Figure 3(d)). In the overall structure	 the helix Î±6 adds to the helix bundle conformation and appears to be rigid in structure. Intriguingly	 the helix Î±6 increases the depth of the valley (âˆ¼18 Ã…) as compared to bacterial RNase III (âˆ¼13 Ã…). The acidic amino acid-rich region between the motif II-NT and motif II-CT was not observed in the electron density	 indicating that this portion of RNase IIIb is highly flexible. Almost all the RNase IIIa and RNase IIIb domains of Dicers contain acidic amino acid-rich regions	 whose function remains to be elucidated (Figure 1(b)). This region of Gi-Dicer is shorter than those of higher eukaryotic Dicers and forms a short loop (Figure 2(d)).  dsRNA cleavage activity of the RNase IIIb domain  The structure of the RNase IIIb domain suggests that the homodimer has the ability to cleave dsRNAs. Thus	 the dsRNA cleavage activity of the RNase IIIb domain was assessed with long (114 bp) dsRNA substrates in the presence of magnesium ions. This analysis indicated that the RNase IIIb domain can indeed cleave dsRNA substrates with the extent of cleavage dependent on the protein concentration (Figure 4(a) and (b)). The lengths of the products were shorter than 21 bp dsRNA	 a typical size of the short interfering RNA generated by Dicer. In analysis of the cleavage products	 the activity of the isolated RNase IIIb domain has been found to be similar to that of the bacterial RNase III enzyme22 rather than that of full-length Dicers (Figure 4(c)).

Lane RIIIb is products of RNase IIIb	 and lane oligo M is synthetic RNA oligonucleotide marker(s)	 and those sequences are shown on the right-hand side. RNase III generates products with 3â€²-OH termini	 whereas alkaline hydrolysis and RNase T1 generates fragments with 2â€²	3â€²-cyclic phosphate. Thus	 synthetic RNA oligonucleotides with 3â€²-OH can be used for markers. The lower images show cleavage patterns of the substrates. Bold arrows indicate major cleavage sites and thin arrows indicate minor cleavage sites. These results indicate the RNase IIIb products with 2 nt 3â€² overhang ends. Figure options The properties of a truncated form of Ec-RNase III lacking the dsRBD (Ec-RNase III nuclease domain) have been analyzed	23 and the dsRBD is assumed to provide substrate-binding affinity under physiological conditions.12 Analysis using recombinant Dicers showed that the Hs-Dicer lacking dsRBD reduces the dsRNA cleavage activity.13 To investigate the influence of the attachment of dsRBD on the catalytic activity	 we prepared the RNase IIIb-dsRBD and assessed its dsRNA cleavage activity. As with RNase IIIb	 the RNase IIIb-dsRBD protein was a homodimer in solution by gel-filtration analysis (our unpublished results). This analysis showed that RNase IIIb-dsRBD can cleave dsRNA substrates approximately 100 times more efficiently than the RNase IIIb domain (Figure 4(a) and (b)). This number was estimated from the almost-identical patterns of lane 8 of Figure 4(a) with lane 4 of Figure 4(b)	 as analyzed using the ImageJ software (NIH).  Processing of short dsRNA substrate by the RNase IIIb domain  To map sites cleaved by the RNase IIIb homodimer	 labeled short (21 bp) dsRNAs were used in the reaction. The RNase IIIb homodimer cleaved 21 bp dsRNAs near the central region (Figure 4(d)). The major cleavage sites indicated that the RNase IIIb homodimer generates short dsRNAs with 2 nt 3â€² overhang	 the characteristic products generated by RNase III enzymes	 including human Dicer and Drosha.12	13	24 This analysis indicated that RNase IIIb processes dsRNA substrates into fragments with 2 nt 3â€² overhang end.  Active site  Magnesium ions are essential to the nuclease activity of bacterial RNase III	 Dicers	6	7	12	14 and the isolated RNase IIIb domain (data not shown). Our structural analysis showed that four magnesium ions bind to the Hs-Dicer RNase IIIb homodimer. These magnesium ions located on the valley are octahedrally coordinated by oxygen ligands with an Mgâ€“O distance of approximately 2.2 Ã… (Figure 5(a)). The magnesium ions located at the both ends of the valley were assigned to Mg-1	 and the ions located at the middle of the valley were assigned to Mg-2 (Figure 5(b)). The distances between the two Mg-1 sites in two homodimers (B-Bâ€² and A-C dimers	 see Figure 5(b)) are 20.5 Ã… and 20.7 Ã…	 and the distances between the Mg-1 and Mg-2 sites in the three monomers (A	 B and C molecules) are 7.5â€“7.7 Ã…. The distances between the metal ions at Mg-1 sites among dsRNA-free forms of RNase III proteins are 20.2â€“21.6 Ã… (Table 3)	 indicating that the distance between the Mg-1 sites in the RNase IIIb homodimer is essentially identical with the catalytic-metal-pair distance in the RNase III enzymes.

E1813 also interacts with one of the three water molecules	 and D1709 interacts with one of the three coordinated water molecules of the Mg-1 ion. Mg-2 is coordinated directly by the carboxylate oxygen atom of D1709 and by four water molecules (Figure 5(b)). One of the coordinated water molecules exhibits weak density. D1709 also interacts with one of the four water molecules. Two residues of D1713 positioned at the center of homodimeric structure interact with the coordinated water molecules (Figure 5(b)). The D1713 residues in the three molecules of the asymmetric unit have two different conformations (Figure 5(b)). The D1713 residues in molecules A and B involve the binding of one Mg-2 ion	 whereas the D1713 residue in molecule C involves the binding of both Mg-2 ions. The residues E1705	 D1709	 D1810	 and E1813 are highly conserved. In contrast	 D1713	 which is involved indirectly in the Mg-2 coordination	 is highly conserved only within the Dicer RNase IIIb domains except for the Gi-Dicer RNase IIIb. The residue D1713 corresponds to K1324 in the RNase IIIa domain of Hs-Dicer (Figure 1(b)).  The Mg-1 site of RNase IIIb is identical with the site of the magnesium ion of Aa-RNase III	 and the M1 site of Gi-Dicer (Figure 5).14	15 The Mg-1 site is similar to the Ca-A site of Mtb-RNase III.17 The Mg-2 site of RNase IIIb structure is located at the inner region of the valley	 similar to the M2 site of Gi-Dicer (compare Figure 5(b) and (c)). The residue D1713 contributes to the strong binding of Mg-2	 thus the ion is observed at a lower concentration of magnesium ions	 compared to the crystallization condition of Gi-Dicer. Since the residue D1713 of RNase IIIb involves the binding of Mg-2	 the Mg-2 is further away from the Mg-1 site compared to the M2 site of Gi-Dicer.  In the structure of Mtb-RNase III	 Ca-2Â°	 an additional calcium ion	 is bound near the active site. The Ca-2Â° site is located at the outer region of the valley	 and it is similar to the M3 site of Gi-Dicer (Figure 5(c)). These metal ions at the M3 site are thought to be involved in the substrate binding.17 In contrast	 the crystal structure of the Aa-RNase III-product complex indicated that the residue E64	 which is thought to bind to metal ion	 forms a hydrogen bond with a phosphate oxygen atom.25 Residue E64 of Aa-RNase III corresponds to P1729 in the RNase IIIb domain of Hs-Dicer	 thus the residue of RNase IIIb binds to neither a metal ion nor an RNA substrate (Figures 1(b) and 5(b)).  dsRNA cleavage activity of the RNase IIIb domain mutants  To assess the effects of residues coordinated to metal ions	 the RNase IIIb mutants E1705A	 D1709A	 D1713A	 D1810A	 E1813A	 and D1713K were prepared. In the case of heterodimer formation between the RNase IIIa and RNase IIIb domains	 K1324 of RNase IIIa is the counterpart of D1713 of RNase IIIb. This analysis indicated that the mutations E1705A	 D1709A	 D1810A	 and E1813A apparently reduced the dsRNA cleavage activity (Figure 6). In particular	 mutations D1709A and E1813A were greatly decreased in dsRNA cleavage activity. The differing effects of the RNase IIIb mutants on the cleavage activity are consistent with those of Ec-RNase III mutants.11	12	26	27 On the other hand	 mutations D1713A and D1713K did not have a significant effect on the cleavage activity (Figure 6). These results indicate that the Mg-1 ion of RNase IIIb has an important role in its catalysis	 and the Mg-2 ion might be dispensable for the cleavage reaction. However	 the exact role of the Mg-2 is unknown. The results support a model	 consistent with the data	 of the complex between a dsRNA substrate and the RNase IIIb homodimer (see Discussion).  dsRNA cleavage activity of mutants. dsRNA cleavage activity of the RNase IIIb ...

Figure options In addition	 to investigate the effect of the insertion sequence	 the deletion mutant RNase IIIb-Î”13 (deleted residues 1787â€“1799) was prepared. The analysis of the mutant RNase IIIb-Î”13 showed that the deletion has no apparent effect on the cleavage activity (Figure 6). This result suggests that the flexible region does not contribute to recognition of the dsRNA substrate	 and does not affect cleavage.  Discussion Dimerization of the RNase III domains of Hs-Dicer  The results presented here show that the RNase IIIb domain	 a C-terminal RNase III domain of Hs-Dicer	 forms a stable homodimer. The homodimerization of the isolated RNase IIIb of Dicer differs from the heterodimerization between RNase IIIa and RNase IIIb	 which was previously established on the basis of the results of biochemical analysis of Hs-Dicer and structural analysis of Gi-Dicer.13	14 Our biochemical analysis also indicated that the Hs-Dicer RNase IIIb homodimer is an active RNase III enzyme capable of cleaving dsRNA. Structural analysis described herein (Figures 3(b) and (c); Table 2; and see below) indicated that the structural basis for the dimerization is strictly conserved	 and must be necessary to maintain the appropriate positions of two metal ions at the Mg-1 sites	 spaced 20â€“22 Ã… apart	 and necessary to provide binding sites for dsRNA	 as seen in the complex structure of Aa-RNase III-dsRNA.25 For this reason	 the in vitro RNase III activity found in the Hs-Dicer RNase IIIb homodimer might be fortuitous due to the isolation of the domain.  The residues forming the dimer interface are located on Î±3	 Î±4	 Î±7	 and Î±8 (Figure 1(b)). In particular	 the residues within Î±3 and Î±4 are highly conserved. The aromatic residues F1706 and Y1721 contribute to strengthening the dimerization. F1706 corresponds to M1317 in the RNase IIIa domain of Hs-Dicer. Previous mutation analysis of Ec-RNase III has indicated that the mutant F40M	 corresponding to F1706 and M1317 in RNase III domains of Hs-Dicer	 is functional.11 Thus	 residue M1317 in the RNase IIIa domain of Hs-Dicer can maintain its activity. In addition	 other residues forming hydrophobic interactions at the dimer interface could be replaced with the residues at homologous positions of the RNase IIIa domain of Hs-Dicer	 as mentioned previously.13  As described above	 the dimer interfaces of RNase III proteins must fundamentally share a common structural feature. Our modeling analysis of the dimerization of RNase IIIb and RNase IIIa	 which is based on the Hs-Dicer RNase IIIb structure	 also suggested that the two RNase III domains of Hs-Dicer could form a heterodimer with the similar dimer interface (Figure 7(a)).

The scissile phosphodiester bonds	 which generate 2 nt 3â€² overhang ends	 are indicated by arrows. Figure options Metal ions and catalytic activity  Previous mutational analysis of Ec-RNase III and structural analysis of Aa-RNase III suggested that the Mg-1 ion is involved in dsRNA cleavage.11.; 23.; 26.; 28. ;  29. E110 of Aa-RNase III	 corresponding to E117 of Ec-RNase III	 binds to Mg-1 through a bidentate interaction	 and the mutation of the homologous position of Ec-RNase III abolishes the dsRNA cleavage activity.11	28 Our structural and biochemical analyses showed that E1813 of the RNase IIIb domain corresponds to E110 of Aa-RNase III	 and has an essential role in catalysis. Thus	 the homologous residues in RNase III enzymes may be fundamentally important for their catalysis through the metal ion binding.  Mg-2 is coordinated directly by D1709	 and indrectly by D1713 through a water molecule. D1709 also binds to the two water molecules bound to Mg-2 and Mg-1	 respectively. Mutation of D45 of Ec-RNase III	 corresponding to D44 of Aa-RNase III	 abolishes the dsRNA cleavage activity.11	12 Our results indicated that D1709	 corresponding to D44 of Aa-RNase III	 plays an important role in the catalysis. The structure of Gi-Dicer	 which lacks the acidic residue corresponding to D1713	 showed that the additional metal ion (M2) can bind near the Mg-2 site in the presence of a high concentration of MnCl2. Due to the metal binding around the Mg-2 and M2 sites	 residue D1709 might have a critical role in the catalysis. However	 it is unclear whether the M2 ion in Gi-Dicer and the Mg-2 ion in RNase IIIb have the same role in the catalysis	 because the positions of M2 and Mg-2 sites are distinctly different in detail (Figure 5(b) and (c)).  The environment of metal ions around the active sites may be diversified among RNase III enzymes. The involvement of two-metal ions in Ec-RNase III catalysis has been suggested.16 The distance of 7.6 Ã… between the Mg-1 and Mg-2 sites in the RNase IIIb structure is inconsistent with a two-metal-ion mechanism.30	31 In the active sites of RNase H	32 the ASV integrase	33 the EcoRV	34 and the group I intron	35 which are thought to use the two-metal-ion mechanism	 there are two metal ions spaced 3.6â€“4.2 Ã… apart. If the Mg-2 functions as one of the two catalytic metal ions	 some movement may be required. Transposition of metal ions for catalytic reaction has been observed in EcoRV-DNA complex structures.36  A model for dsRNA cleavage by the RNase IIIb domain  Our structural and biochemical analyses of the RNase IIIb domain enable us to build a robust model of the complex between the RNase IIIb and the A-form dsRNA substrate ( Figure 7(b)). In this model	 we hypothesize that the Mg-1 ion is responsible for activation of the water nucleophile	 as suggested.13	16 On the basis of the structure of the 3â€²-5â€² exonuclease active site30 and the RNase H active site	32 the Mg-1 positions at both ends were placed at stereochemically reasonable sites. The model is similar to the crystal structure of Aa-RNase III complexed with dsRNA products	25 except for the vertical distance between the RNase III enzyme and the dsRNA substrate (in the left-hand image in Figure 7(b)). A straight A-form dsRNA collided with the N terminus of Î±6 of RNase IIIb	 indicating that some conformational changes of a dsRNA and/or the RNase IIIb protein may be required for the catalytic reaction. For this reason	 a slightly curved dsRNA was used in this model	 in which two Mg-2 ions are located near the RNA minor groove between the cleavage sites; thus	 the Mg-2 may contribute to RNA binding by neutralizing the negative charge of the protein valley ( Figure 2(b)).  Insert region of the RNase III domains of Dicers  In our model	 the structure of the motif II was close to the active site and a dsRNA substrate (Figure 7(b)). Our biochemical analysis of the mutant RNase IIIb-Î”13 showed that the acidic amino acid-rich region has no apparent effect on the cleavage activity. Therefore	 the region could provide some unidentified function(s) to Dicer RNase IIIb domains of higher eukaryotes without significant effect on the cleavage activity. A possibility is that the region interacts with other protein factors involved in the gene-silencing pathway	 according to the experimental results showing that both RNase III domains of Dicer interact with the PIWI box.9 In our analysis	 the cleavage activity of RNase IIIb enzyme is approximately 100 times weaker than that of Ec-RNase III (our unpublished results). Furthermore	 recombinant full-length Hs-Dicer exhibits a remarkably low level of activity.7	13 One of the reasons for the low level of activity of Hs-Dicer may be the additional helix Î±6 formed by motif II	 which is assumed to interrupt dsRNA binding.  Conclusions The crystal structure of the RNase IIIb domain of Hs-Dicer showed that it forms a stable homodimer	 similar to the dimerization of other RNase III enzymes. Further	 the RNase IIIb homodimer can cleave dsRNA into shorter dsRNA fragments with 2 nt 3â€² overhang ends. These results may indicate that Dicer RNase III domains are capable of forming homodimer and heterodimer	 both with RNase III enzyme activity. This analysis provides the first structural view of Hs-Dicer	 suggesting that the RNase III domain has strictly conserved the structural bases needed to process dsRNA substrates. The RNase III domain has evolved	 in part	 its structural features probably to function in the gene-silencing pathway.  																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												
4	40||Human Dicer contains two RNase III domains (RNase IIIa and RNase IIIb) that are responsible for the production of short interfering RNAs and microRNAs. These small RNAs induce gene silencing known as RNA interference. Here	 we report the crystal structure of the C-terminal RNase III domain (RNase IIIb) of human Dicer at 2.0 Ã… resolution. The structure revealed that the RNase IIIb domain can form a tightly associated homodimer	 which is similar to the dimers of the bacterial RNase III domains and the two RNase III domains of Giardia Dicer. Biochemical analysis showed that the RNase IIIb homodimer can cleave double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs)	 and generate short dsRNAs with 2 nt 3â€² overhang	 which is characteristic of RNase III products. The RNase IIIb domain contained two magnesium ions per monomer around the active site. The distance between two Mg-1 ions is approximately 20.6 Ã…	 almost identical with those observed in bacterial RNase III enzymes and Giardia Dicer	 while the locations of two Mg-2 ions were not conserved at all. We presume that Mg-1 ions act as catalysts for dsRNA cleavage	 while Mg-2 ions are involved in RNA binding.

Dicer is responsible for the processing of long double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) into short interfering RNAs	 and for the processing of precursor microRNAs into microRNAs.1	2 These small RNAs provide specificity to protein effector complexes that repress mRNA transcription or translation	 or that catalyze mRNA degradation.1	2  Dicer homologues have been found in all eukaryotes studied	 except for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In zebrafish and mouse	 the Dicer protein is essential to normal development. 3	4 In Arabidopsis thaliana	 mutants of dicer-like 1 (DCL1) show various phenotypic defects. 5 Analysis of recombinant human (Homo sapiens	 Hs) Dicer indicated that the enzyme generates short interfering RNAs s from dsRNA	6	7 and that it produces the mature let-7 RNA from the microRNA let-7 precursor.6 Dicers are approximately 200 kDa multidomain proteins that consist of an N-terminal DEXH-box helicase/ATPase domain	 a domain of unknown function (DUF283)	 a PAZ domain	 two RNase III nuclease domains (RNase IIIa and RNase IIIb)	 and a dsRNA-binding domain (dsRBD). RNase III domain of Dicer appears to interact with the PIWI domain of Argonaute proteins in cells.8	9 Thus	 the Dicer interactions with PIWI domains are considered to be involved in a substrate transfer.10  RNase III proteins are divided into three classes	 and classes 1	2	 and 3 are represented by Escherichia coli (Ec) RNase III	 Drosha	 and Dicer	 respectively. 11	12 Class 1 enzymes have one RNase III domain	 whereas class 2 and class 3 enzymes have two RNase III domains (Figure 1(a)). To our knowledge	 there is no report of the presence of class 1 enzymes in mammals. Biochemical and structural studies indicated that class 1 enzymes function as homodimers.11	12In vitro mutational analysis and gradient sedimentation analysis using recombinant Dicer have indicated the validity of a single processing center model for Hs-Dicer	 which suggests that RNase IIIa and RNase IIIb in a Dicer molecule form two catalytic sites through intramolecular dimerization	 analogous to the homodimerization of the bacterial RNase III. 13 In this model	 the two catalytic sites	 which cleave an RNA phosphodiester bond	 generate RNA products with 2 nt 3â€² overhangs. RBDs	 dsRBD and PAZ assist the cleavage reaction. Recently	 the crystal structure of a primitive form of Dicer from Giardia intestinalis (Gi) was determined and it was shown that two RNase III domains of Gi-Dicer are capable of forming an intramolecular heterodimer. 14  Domain structure of the RNase III superfamily and sequence alignment of RNase ...

Class 2 and class 3 RNase III proteins have two tandem RNase III domains	 RNase IIIa and RNase IIIb (RIIIa and RIIIb	 respectively).

Figure options RNase III enzymes require divalent metal ions	 with Mg2+ as the preferred species.12 The Mg2+-dependent activity of RNase III is consistent with that of Hs-Dicer.6	7 The crystal structure of the RNase III nuclease domain from Aquifex aeolicus (Aa)	 which is complexed with Mg2+ or Mn2+ in each monomer	 provided the first structural information for the active site.11	15 On the other hand	 kinetic and inhibitor analysis of Ec-RNase III indicates the involvement of two magnesium ions in RNA phosphodiester hydrolysis.16 The crystal structure of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) RNase III nuclease domain in its complex with two calcium ions per monomer showed that one calcium ion (Ca-A) binds at a position similar to that of the magnesium ion of Aa-RNase III	 and the second (Ca-2Â°) binds near the active site. 17 In the Gi-Dicer structure	 a second metal ion (M2) was observed in the active site	 which is assumed to play a direct role in catalysis.14 Recent structural analyses of RNase III enzymes have been summarized and reviewed. 18.; 19. ;  20.  Here	 we report the crystal structure of the RNase IIIb domain of Hs-Dicer at 2.0 Ã… resolution. The structure revealed that the RNase IIIb domain can form a tightly associated homodimer	 which is similar to the dimers of the bacterial RNase III domains and the two RNase III domains of Gi-Dicer. The RNase IIIb domain binds two magnesium ions per monomer at or near the active sites. Mg-1 is coordinated by three of four invariant amino acids	 and the distance between two Mg-1 ions in the homodimer is approximately 20.6 Ã…	 almost identical with those of dsRNA-free forms of RNase III proteins (20.2â€“21.6 Ã…). Further	 biochemical analysis indicated that the RNase IIIb homodimer can process dsRNAs into shorter dsRNAs similar in terminal structure and size to the products of bacterial RNase III enzymes.  Results Overall structure  The crystal structure of RNase IIIb has been determined at 2.0 Ã… resolution and refined to a crystallographic R-factor of 0.211 and Rfree of 0.234 (Table 1).

The helix Î±6 and the subsequent disordered region correspond to the insert region of the RNase III domains of Dicers (Figures 1(b) and 2(a)). In this region	 the RNase IIIa domain and RNase IIIb domain of Hs-Dicer encode 177 residues (residues 1374â€“1550) and 37 residues (residues 1763â€“1799)	 respectively.  Homodimerization of the RNase IIIb domain  The structure of the RNase IIIb domain shows a tightly associated homodimer. Gel-filtration chromatographic analysis indicated that the RNase IIIb domain exists as a stable dimer in solution (data not shown). The dimer interface is composed of the antiparallel helices Î±3 and Î±4	 the C terminus of Î±7	 and the N terminus of Î±8. Dimerization is accomplished primarily through hydrophobic interactions (Figure 3(a)). Three aromatic residues	 F1706	 Y1714 and Y1721	 contribute to the dimerization via hydrophobic interactions. F1706 interacts with T1717	 L1732 and R1736	 whereas Y1714 interacts with I1711 and L1827	 and Y1721 interacts with R1703 and L1707. These aromatic residues are buried along the dimer interface. Among RNase III proteins	 F1706 is highly conserved	 except for RNase IIIa domain. Y1721 is highly conserved as aromatic amino acids. Y1714 is highly conserved within RNase IIIb domains of Dicers ( Figure 1(b)). In the RNase IIIa domain of Hs-Dicer	 M1317	 H1325 and F1332 correspond to F1706	 Y1714 and Y1721	 respectively.

The pink broken line indicates the flexible region	 containing 20 amino acid residues. Figure options In addition to hydrophobic interactions	 hydrogen bonds are observed in the dimer interface. R1703 forms hydrogen bonds with the main-chain carbonyl groups of Y1721 and H1727. R1736 also forms a hydrogen bond with the main-chain carbonyl group of F1706. The hydroxyl group of Y1714 forms a hydrogen bond to the hydroxyl group of Y1820. R1703 is highly conserved	 while R1736 is conserved as basic amino acids	 Arg or Lys (Figure 1(b)). In the RNase IIIa domain of Hs-Dicer	 R1314	 H1325 and R1347	 respectively	 correspond to R1703	 Y1714 and R1736.  The homodimeric structure is similar to those of homodimers of bacterial RNase III proteins and a dimer of two RNase III domains of Gi-Dicer (Figure 3(b) and (c)).

In the overall structure	 the helix Î±6 adds to the helix bundle conformation and appears to be rigid in structure. Intriguingly	 the helix Î±6 increases the depth of the valley (âˆ¼18 Ã…) as compared to bacterial RNase III (âˆ¼13 Ã…). The acidic amino acid-rich region between the motif II-NT and motif II-CT was not observed in the electron density	 indicating that this portion of RNase IIIb is highly flexible. Almost all the RNase IIIa and RNase IIIb domains of Dicers contain acidic amino acid-rich regions	 whose function remains to be elucidated (Figure 1(b)). This region of Gi-Dicer is shorter than those of higher eukaryotic Dicers and forms a short loop (Figure 2(d)).  dsRNA cleavage activity of the RNase IIIb domain  The structure of the RNase IIIb domain suggests that the homodimer has the ability to cleave dsRNAs. Thus	 the dsRNA cleavage activity of the RNase IIIb domain was assessed with long (114 bp) dsRNA substrates in the presence of magnesium ions. This analysis indicated that the RNase IIIb domain can indeed cleave dsRNA substrates with the extent of cleavage dependent on the protein concentration (Figure 4(a) and (b)). The lengths of the products were shorter than 21 bp dsRNA	 a typical size of the short interfering RNA generated by Dicer. In analysis of the cleavage products	 the activity of the isolated RNase IIIb domain has been found to be similar to that of the bacterial RNase III enzyme22 rather than that of full-length Dicers (Figure 4(c)).

Thus	 synthetic RNA oligonucleotides with 3â€²-OH can be used for markers. The lower images show cleavage patterns of the substrates.

Figure options The properties of a truncated form of Ec-RNase III lacking the dsRBD (Ec-RNase III nuclease domain) have been analyzed	23 and the dsRBD is assumed to provide substrate-binding affinity under physiological conditions.12 Analysis using recombinant Dicers showed that the Hs-Dicer lacking dsRBD reduces the dsRNA cleavage activity.13 To investigate the influence of the attachment of dsRBD on the catalytic activity	 we prepared the RNase IIIb-dsRBD and assessed its dsRNA cleavage activity. As with RNase IIIb	 the RNase IIIb-dsRBD protein was a homodimer in solution by gel-filtration analysis (our unpublished results). This analysis showed that RNase IIIb-dsRBD can cleave dsRNA substrates approximately 100 times more efficiently than the RNase IIIb domain (Figure 4(a) and (b)). This number was estimated from the almost-identical patterns of lane 8 of Figure 4(a) with lane 4 of Figure 4(b)	 as analyzed using the ImageJ software (NIH).  Processing of short dsRNA substrate by the RNase IIIb domain  To map sites cleaved by the RNase IIIb homodimer	 labeled short (21 bp) dsRNAs were used in the reaction. The RNase IIIb homodimer cleaved 21 bp dsRNAs near the central region (Figure 4(d)). The major cleavage sites indicated that the RNase IIIb homodimer generates short dsRNAs with 2 nt 3â€² overhang	 the characteristic products generated by RNase III enzymes	 including human Dicer and Drosha.12	13	24 This analysis indicated that RNase IIIb processes dsRNA substrates into fragments with 2 nt 3â€² overhang end.  Active site  Magnesium ions are essential to the nuclease activity of bacterial RNase III	 Dicers	6	7	12	14 and the isolated RNase IIIb domain (data not shown). Our structural analysis showed that four magnesium ions bind to the Hs-Dicer RNase IIIb homodimer. These magnesium ions located on the valley are octahedrally coordinated by oxygen ligands with an Mgâ€“O distance of approximately 2.2 Ã… (Figure 5(a)). The magnesium ions located at the both ends of the valley were assigned to Mg-1	 and the ions located at the middle of the valley were assigned to Mg-2 (Figure 5(b)). The distances between the two Mg-1 sites in two homodimers (B-Bâ€² and A-C dimers	 see Figure 5(b)) are 20.5 Ã… and 20.7 Ã…	 and the distances between the Mg-1 and Mg-2 sites in the three monomers (A	 B and C molecules) are 7.5â€“7.7 Ã…. The distances between the metal ions at Mg-1 sites among dsRNA-free forms of RNase III proteins are 20.2â€“21.6 Ã… (Table 3)	 indicating that the distance between the Mg-1 sites in the RNase IIIb homodimer is essentially identical with the catalytic-metal-pair distance in the RNase III enzymes.

E1813 also interacts with one of the three water molecules	 and D1709 interacts with one of the three coordinated water molecules of the Mg-1 ion. Mg-2 is coordinated directly by the carboxylate oxygen atom of D1709 and by four water molecules (Figure 5(b)). One of the coordinated water molecules exhibits weak density. D1709 also interacts with one of the four water molecules. Two residues of D1713 positioned at the center of homodimeric structure interact with the coordinated water molecules (Figure 5(b)). The D1713 residues in the three molecules of the asymmetric unit have two different conformations (Figure 5(b)). The D1713 residues in molecules A and B involve the binding of one Mg-2 ion	 whereas the D1713 residue in molecule C involves the binding of both Mg-2 ions. The residues E1705	 D1709	 D1810	 and E1813 are highly conserved. In contrast	 D1713	 which is involved indirectly in the Mg-2 coordination	 is highly conserved only within the Dicer RNase IIIb domains except for the Gi-Dicer RNase IIIb. The residue D1713 corresponds to K1324 in the RNase IIIa domain of Hs-Dicer (Figure 1(b)).  The Mg-1 site of RNase IIIb is identical with the site of the magnesium ion of Aa-RNase III	 and the M1 site of Gi-Dicer (Figure 5).14	15 The Mg-1 site is similar to the Ca-A site of Mtb-RNase III.17 The Mg-2 site of RNase IIIb structure is located at the inner region of the valley	 similar to the M2 site of Gi-Dicer (compare Figure 5(b) and (c)). The residue D1713 contributes to the strong binding of Mg-2	 thus the ion is observed at a lower concentration of magnesium ions	 compared to the crystallization condition of Gi-Dicer. Since the residue D1713 of RNase IIIb involves the binding of Mg-2	 the Mg-2 is further away from the Mg-1 site compared to the M2 site of Gi-Dicer.  In the structure of Mtb-RNase III	 Ca-2Â°	 an additional calcium ion	 is bound near the active site. The Ca-2Â° site is located at the outer region of the valley	 and it is similar to the M3 site of Gi-Dicer (Figure 5(c)). These metal ions at the M3 site are thought to be involved in the substrate binding.17 In contrast	 the crystal structure of the Aa-RNase III-product complex indicated that the residue E64	 which is thought to bind to metal ion	 forms a hydrogen bond with a phosphate oxygen atom.25 Residue E64 of Aa-RNase III corresponds to P1729 in the RNase IIIb domain of Hs-Dicer	 thus the residue of RNase IIIb binds to neither a metal ion nor an RNA substrate (Figures 1(b) and 5(b)).  dsRNA cleavage activity of the RNase IIIb domain mutants  To assess the effects of residues coordinated to metal ions	 the RNase IIIb mutants E1705A	 D1709A	 D1713A	 D1810A	 E1813A	 and D1713K were prepared. In the case of heterodimer formation between the RNase IIIa and RNase IIIb domains	 K1324 of RNase IIIa is the counterpart of D1713 of RNase IIIb. This analysis indicated that the mutations E1705A	 D1709A	 D1810A	 and E1813A apparently reduced the dsRNA cleavage activity (Figure 6). In particular	 mutations D1709A and E1813A were greatly decreased in dsRNA cleavage activity. The differing effects of the RNase IIIb mutants on the cleavage activity are consistent with those of Ec-RNase III mutants.11	12	26	27 On the other hand	 mutations D1713A and D1713K did not have a significant effect on the cleavage activity (Figure 6). These results indicate that the Mg-1 ion of RNase IIIb has an important role in its catalysis	 and the Mg-2 ion might be dispensable for the cleavage reaction. However	 the exact role of the Mg-2 is unknown. The results support a model	 consistent with the data	 of the complex between a dsRNA substrate and the RNase IIIb homodimer (see Discussion).  dsRNA cleavage activity of mutants. dsRNA cleavage activity of the RNase IIIb ...

Figure options In addition	 to investigate the effect of the insertion sequence	 the deletion mutant RNase IIIb-Î”13 (deleted residues 1787â€“1799) was prepared. The analysis of the mutant RNase IIIb-Î”13 showed that the deletion has no apparent effect on the cleavage activity (Figure 6). This result suggests that the flexible region does not contribute to recognition of the dsRNA substrate	 and does not affect cleavage.  Discussion Dimerization of the RNase III domains of Hs-Dicer  The results presented here show that the RNase IIIb domain	 a C-terminal RNase III domain of Hs-Dicer	 forms a stable homodimer. The homodimerization of the isolated RNase IIIb of Dicer differs from the heterodimerization between RNase IIIa and RNase IIIb	 which was previously established on the basis of the results of biochemical analysis of Hs-Dicer and structural analysis of Gi-Dicer.13	14 Our biochemical analysis also indicated that the Hs-Dicer RNase IIIb homodimer is an active RNase III enzyme capable of cleaving dsRNA. Structural analysis described herein (Figures 3(b) and (c); Table 2; and see below) indicated that the structural basis for the dimerization is strictly conserved	 and must be necessary to maintain the appropriate positions of two metal ions at the Mg-1 sites	 spaced 20â€“22 Ã… apart	 and necessary to provide binding sites for dsRNA	 as seen in the complex structure of Aa-RNase III-dsRNA.25 For this reason	 the in vitro RNase III activity found in the Hs-Dicer RNase IIIb homodimer might be fortuitous due to the isolation of the domain.  The residues forming the dimer interface are located on Î±3	 Î±4	 Î±7	 and Î±8 (Figure 1(b)). In particular	 the residues within Î±3 and Î±4 are highly conserved. The aromatic residues F1706 and Y1721 contribute to strengthening the dimerization. F1706 corresponds to M1317 in the RNase IIIa domain of Hs-Dicer. Previous mutation analysis of Ec-RNase III has indicated that the mutant F40M	 corresponding to F1706 and M1317 in RNase III domains of Hs-Dicer	 is functional.11 Thus	 residue M1317 in the RNase IIIa domain of Hs-Dicer can maintain its activity. In addition	 other residues forming hydrophobic interactions at the dimer interface could be replaced with the residues at homologous positions of the RNase IIIa domain of Hs-Dicer	 as mentioned previously.13  As described above	 the dimer interfaces of RNase III proteins must fundamentally share a common structural feature. Our modeling analysis of the dimerization of RNase IIIb and RNase IIIa	 which is based on the Hs-Dicer RNase IIIb structure	 also suggested that the two RNase III domains of Hs-Dicer could form a heterodimer with the similar dimer interface (Figure 7(a)).

The scissile phosphodiester bonds	 which generate 2 nt 3â€² overhang ends	 are indicated by arrows. Figure options Metal ions and catalytic activity  Previous mutational analysis of Ec-RNase III and structural analysis of Aa-RNase III suggested that the Mg-1 ion is involved in dsRNA cleavage.11.; 23.; 26.; 28. ;  29. E110 of Aa-RNase III	 corresponding to E117 of Ec-RNase III	 binds to Mg-1 through a bidentate interaction	 and the mutation of the homologous position of Ec-RNase III abolishes the dsRNA cleavage activity.11	28 Our structural and biochemical analyses showed that E1813 of the RNase IIIb domain corresponds to E110 of Aa-RNase III	 and has an essential role in catalysis. Thus	 the homologous residues in RNase III enzymes may be fundamentally important for their catalysis through the metal ion binding.  Mg-2 is coordinated directly by D1709	 and indrectly by D1713 through a water molecule. D1709 also binds to the two water molecules bound to Mg-2 and Mg-1	 respectively. Mutation of D45 of Ec-RNase III	 corresponding to D44 of Aa-RNase III	 abolishes the dsRNA cleavage activity.11	12 Our results indicated that D1709	 corresponding to D44 of Aa-RNase III	 plays an important role in the catalysis. The structure of Gi-Dicer	 which lacks the acidic residue corresponding to D1713	 showed that the additional metal ion (M2) can bind near the Mg-2 site in the presence of a high concentration of MnCl2. Due to the metal binding around the Mg-2 and M2 sites	 residue D1709 might have a critical role in the catalysis. However	 it is unclear whether the M2 ion in Gi-Dicer and the Mg-2 ion in RNase IIIb have the same role in the catalysis	 because the positions of M2 and Mg-2 sites are distinctly different in detail (Figure 5(b) and (c)).  The environment of metal ions around the active sites may be diversified among RNase III enzymes. The involvement of two-metal ions in Ec-RNase III catalysis has been suggested.16 The distance of 7.6 Ã… between the Mg-1 and Mg-2 sites in the RNase IIIb structure is inconsistent with a two-metal-ion mechanism.30	31 In the active sites of RNase H	32 the ASV integrase	33 the EcoRV	34 and the group I intron	35 which are thought to use the two-metal-ion mechanism	 there are two metal ions spaced 3.6â€“4.2 Ã… apart. If the Mg-2 functions as one of the two catalytic metal ions	 some movement may be required. Transposition of metal ions for catalytic reaction has been observed in EcoRV-DNA complex structures.36  A model for dsRNA cleavage by the RNase IIIb domain  Our structural and biochemical analyses of the RNase IIIb domain enable us to build a robust model of the complex between the RNase IIIb and the A-form dsRNA substrate ( Figure 7(b)). In this model	 we hypothesize that the Mg-1 ion is responsible for activation of the water nucleophile	 as suggested.13	16 On the basis of the structure of the 3â€²-5â€² exonuclease active site30 and the RNase H active site	32 the Mg-1 positions at both ends were placed at stereochemically reasonable sites. The model is similar to the crystal structure of Aa-RNase III complexed with dsRNA products	25 except for the vertical distance between the RNase III enzyme and the dsRNA substrate (in the left-hand image in Figure 7(b)). A straight A-form dsRNA collided with the N terminus of Î±6 of RNase IIIb	 indicating that some conformational changes of a dsRNA and/or the RNase IIIb protein may be required for the catalytic reaction. For this reason	 a slightly curved dsRNA was used in this model	 in which two Mg-2 ions are located near the RNA minor groove between the cleavage sites; thus	 the Mg-2 may contribute to RNA binding by neutralizing the negative charge of the protein valley ( Figure 2(b)).  Insert region of the RNase III domains of Dicers  In our model	 the structure of the motif II was close to the active site and a dsRNA substrate (Figure 7(b)). Our biochemical analysis of the mutant RNase IIIb-Î”13 showed that the acidic amino acid-rich region has no apparent effect on the cleavage activity. Therefore	 the region could provide some unidentified function(s) to Dicer RNase IIIb domains of higher eukaryotes without significant effect on the cleavage activity. A possibility is that the region interacts with other protein factors involved in the gene-silencing pathway	 according to the experimental results showing that both RNase III domains of Dicer interact with the PIWI box.9 In our analysis	 the cleavage activity of RNase IIIb enzyme is approximately 100 times weaker than that of Ec-RNase III (our unpublished results). Furthermore	 recombinant full-length Hs-Dicer exhibits a remarkably low level of activity.7	13 One of the reasons for the low level of activity of Hs-Dicer may be the additional helix Î±6 formed by motif II	 which is assumed to interrupt dsRNA binding.  Conclusions The crystal structure of the RNase IIIb domain of Hs-Dicer showed that it forms a stable homodimer	 similar to the dimerization of other RNase III enzymes. Further	 the RNase IIIb homodimer can cleave dsRNA into shorter dsRNA fragments with 2 nt 3â€² overhang ends. These results may indicate that Dicer RNase III domains are capable of forming homodimer and heterodimer	 both with RNase III enzyme activity. This analysis provides the first structural view of Hs-Dicer	 suggesting that the RNase III domain has strictly conserved the structural bases needed to process dsRNA substrates. The RNase III domain has evolved	 in part	 its structural features probably to function in the gene-silencing pathway.  																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												
1	41||Mesenchymal cell populations contribute to microenvironments regulating stem cells and the growth of malignant cells. Osteolineage cells participate in the hematopoietic stem cell niche. Here	 we report that deletion of the miRNA processing endonuclease Dicer1 selectively in mesenchymal osteoprogenitors induces markedly disordered hematopoiesis. Hematopoietic changes affected multiple lineages recapitulating key features of human myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) including the development of acute myelogenous leukemia. These changes were microenvironment dependent and induced by specific cells in the osteolineage. Dicer1âˆ’/âˆ’ osteoprogenitors expressed reduced levels of Sbds	 the gene mutated in the human bone marrow failure and leukemia predisposition Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond Syndrome. Deletion of Sbds in osteoprogenitors largely phenocopied Dicer1 deletion. These data demonstrate that differentiation stage-specific perturbations in osteolineage cells can induce complex hematological disorders and indicate the central role individual cellular elements of â€˜estromaâ€™ can play in tissue homeostasis. They reveal that primary changes in the hematopoietic microenvironment can initiate secondary neoplastic disease.  Mesenchymal cells are a part of virtually every tissue in metazoans and are thought to participate in organ formation	 cellular composition	 patterning and size. In adult tissues	 these cells are considered â€˜stromaâ€™ without clear function. Identification of somatic stem cell populations has made possible the study of heterologous cells comprising their niche. Mesenchymal cells of osteolineage have been shown to regulate hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) 1	2 with osterix expressing skeletal progenitors initiating ectopic HSC niche formation3. We previously examined mesenchymal-HSC interactions using mice engineered to express individual genes in osteoblastic cells1	4 and now sought to define more precisely the stage of osteolineage differentiation critical for hematopoiesis using promoters more restricted in their expression to alter candidate genes. We chose to alter a gene that could modulate a landscape of other gene products.  Dicer1 is a RNase III endonuclease essential for miRNA biogenesis5 and RNA processing6. MiRNAs regulate hematopoietic cell fate 7 and global down-regulation of miRNAs by Dicer1 deletion promotes tumorigenesis in a cancer-cell-autonomous manner8. We used Dicer1 deletion as a means of altering multiple gene products in subsets of mesenchymal osteolineage cells. We intercrossed mice expressing GFP-Cre recombinase under the transcriptional control of the osterix9 promoter expressed in osteoprogenitor cells to mice with floxed Dicer1 alleles10 generating Osx-GFP-Cre+: Dicerfl/+ (OCDfl/+control) and Osx-GFP-Cre+ Dicerfl/fl (OCDfl/fl mutant) mice. The Cre transgene in this model is expressed coordinately with endogenous Osterix11 (figure 1a). Mutant mice were born at Mendelian frequency	 but displayed growth retardation and impaired survival (~30% mutant mortality by 8 weeks). Therefore	 we examined mice at age 4â€“6 weeks.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Impaired osteoblastic differentiation in OCD fl/fl mice Impaired osteoblastic differentiation  Dicer1 gene deletion in bone was shown by genomic PCR (figure 1b) and its efficiency confirmed by qPCR of Dicer1 mRNA in primary GFP+ (CD45âˆ’lineageâˆ’CD31âˆ’) cells (figure 1c	d and supplementary figure 1a	b). Dicer1 was not deleted in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (figure 1e) nor expressed in other hematopoietic subpopulations (not shown). Bone marrow stromal osteogenic colony number was decreased relative to total colony forming number (CFU-ALK/CFU-F)	 indicative of reduced osteogenic differentiation (figure 1f	g). OCD fl/fl bone marrow stromal cultures also demonstrated decreased alkaline phosphatase and calcified matrix deposition upon osteogenic differentiation (supplementary figure 1d). In vivo	 osteoblasts from OCDfl/fl mice expressed less of the terminal differentiation marker osteocalcin (figure 1h and supplementary figure 1e). Altered texture of the mineralized bone matrix was observed (supplementary figure 1f)	 but not reduction in trabecular or cortical bone volume (supplementary figure 1g	h). Osteoblast number was modestly	 although significantly decreased	 whereas osteoclast number and function was not affected (supplementary figure 1iâ€“k and not shown). Taken together	 the data show that Dicer1 deletion in osteoprogenitors impairs osteoblastic differentiation both in vitro and in vivo.  Myelodysplasia in OCDfl/fl mice  Leukopenia with reduced numbers of cells in all leukocyte subsets was found in OCDfl/fl mice (figure 2a and supplementary figure 2a). Erythrocyte and platelet counts varied widely in OCDfl/fl mice with some animals showing profound anemia and thrombocytopenia (figure 2a). The variability was at least partly explained by extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen (supplementary figure 3) mitigating cytopenia in those animals. The bone marrow of OCDfl/fl mice was normo- to hypercellular (supplementary figure 2c	d). No significant differences were found in the frequency of immunophenotypically defined hematopoietic stem (Lineageâˆ’ckit+Sca1+(LKS)CD150+CD48âˆ’) and progenitor (LKS) cells (supplementary figures 2d	e and 4). Limiting dilution transplant analysis revealed an increase in HSCs in mutants which did not reach statistical significance (1:29000 vs. 1:52000	 p=0.14). HSC and progenitor function was not impaired in OCDfl/fl mice as demonstrated by competitive reconstitution capacity upon transplantation or colony-forming unit (CFU-C) analysis (supplementary figure 2f	g). Decreased blood cell counts despite normal bone marrow cellularity and normal to increased stem cell function is characteristic of ineffective hematopoiesis.  Figure 2 Figure 2 Myelodysplasia in OCD fl/fl mice Morphologic assessment revealed marked dysplasia with nuclear hypersegmentation in neutrophils and giant platelets in the blood and micromegakaryocytes with hypolobulated	 hyperchromatic nuclei in the bone marrow of OCDfl/fl mice (figure 2b	c and supplementary figure 5aâ€“c) There was neither increased fibrosis on reticulin staining nor ring sideroblasts on iron stains of the bone marrow (not shown). Peripheral cytopenia with dysgranulopoiesis and dysplastic megakaryocytes is consistent with a diagnosis of MDS in mice according to the Bethesda criteria12. The aetiology of human MDS is complex and poorly understood. It has been very difficult to engraft and propagate the hematopoietic characteristics of human MDS in murine models by transplanting hematopoietic cells from MDS patients into immunodeficient mice	 sparking a longstanding debate about a potential causative or facilitating role of the microenvironment in the pathogenesis of this disease.  Examining other key characteristics of the human disease	 we observed increased apoptosis and proliferation of primitive hematopoietic progenitors (figure 2d	e and supplementary figures 6	 7 and 8a)13. Increased apoptosis was limited to primitive progenitor cells	 as no differences were observed in differentiated (lineage +) cells (not shown). Within Lineage-ckit+ cells	 apoptosis was most pronounced in megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEP) (supplementary figure 7). HSC generally are more quiescent in close proximity to the endosteal surface in vivo.14. When we imaged transplanted wild-type cells	 we noted that LKS cells located significantly closer to the endosteum in mutant animals compared with controls (supplementary figure 8b	c) and the frequency of cell duplets	 an indicator of cell proliferation	 was strikingly increased (supplementary figure 8d)	 demonstrating increased proliferation of primitive progenitors despite close proximity to the endosteal surface.  OCDfl/fl mice also had reduced B-cells and B-cell progenitors with a concomitant increased frequency of myeloid cells in the bone marrow (supplementary figures 2h	i and 9) as observed in human MDS15	16. The nature of the B-cell defect in early MDS has remained elusive since cytogenetic studies have failed to link B-cells to the malignant clone in MDS. Interestingly	 osteoblasts have recently been shown to constitute a niche for B-cell lymphopoiesis17	18. OCDfl/fl mice also displayed variable	 but increased vascularity in the bone marrow	 a feature that has been described in MDS19 (supplementary figure 2j). Deficiency of either vitamin B12 or folate which can cause myelodysplastic features13	 were excluded as contributing factors in the OCD fl/fl mice (not shown).  Myelodysplasia is environmentally induced  Next	 we used transplantation to assess the contribution of the microenvironment to the hematopoietic phenotype. Hematopoietic cells of OCDfl/fl (CD45.2) mice demonstrating profound cytopenia and myelodysplastic features were transplanted into (CD45.1) B6.SJL mice (â€œwild-type environmentâ€) (figure 3a). Transplanted animals were without apparent signs of disease. Assessment of peripheral blood and bone marrow 16 weeks (figure 3aâ€“d and supplementary figure 10) or 12 months (supplementary figure 11) after transplant showed nearly complete donor (CD45.2) chimerism with complete normalization of cytopenias	 granulocyte and megakaryocyte morphology	 intramedullary apoptosis of primitive progenitors and bone marrow vascularity. The results indicate that the hematopoietic phenotype cannot be propagated in a hematopoietic cell-autonomous matter. Conversely	 when bone marrow cells from wild-type B6.SJL mice were transplanted into lethally irradiated mutant or control mice (figure 3eâ€“h and supplementary figure 12)	 mutant recipients developed leukopenia	 anemia and thrombocytopenia	 dysplastic features of CD45.1 blood cells	 increased bone marrow vascularity with dysplastic megakaryocytes	 increased frequency of myeloid cells	 decreased frequency of B-cell subsets and increased apoptosis of primitive hematopoietic progenitors. The combined experiments provide formal proof that the myelodysplastic phenotype observed in mutant mice is determined by the micro-environment.  Figure 3 Figure 3 Myelodysplasia in OCD fl/fl mice is induced by the bone marrow microenvironment Osteolineage stage specificity  To examine whether mesenchymal cells of the osteoblastic lineage can directly induce aberrant hematopoiesis	 we established bone marrow derived stromal cell cultures from OCDfl/+ vs. OCDfl/fl mice and co-cultured these with red-fluorescent (DS-red) hematopoietic LKS and MEP cells (supplementary figure 13). Stromal cells were osteolineage committed as evidenced by Osterix expression (and deletion of Dicer1; not shown) but lacked terminally differentiated osteoblasts as indicated by the absence of osteocalcin expression (supplementary figure 13a). Co-cultures on osterix+ osteocalcinâˆ’OCDfl/fl stromal cells revealed increased proliferation of LKS cells (supplementary figure 13 bâ€“d) and impaired megakaryocyte differentiation of MEP cells (supplementary figure 13 eâ€“h). The latter was accompanied by morphological changes in megakaryocytic cells (supplementary figure 13i)	 resembling those observed in vivo. Together	 the data show that the disruption of hematopoiesis observed in OCDfl/fl mice in vivo is	 at least partly	 the result of a direct effect of osterix+osteocalcinâˆ’ osteolineage cells on hematopoietic cell proliferation and differentiaton. To further explore whether osteoprogenitor cells rather than terminally differentiated (osteocalcin+) osteoblasts were the key participants in the hematopoietic abnormality	 we crossed Dicerfl/fl with mice in which cre recombinase was driven by the osteocalcin promoter. Efficient recombination by the osteocalcin-cre as previously demonstrated20 was confirmed (supplementary figure 14a) and serial dilution of DNA isolated from long bones demonstrated equivalent efficacy of Dicer1 deletion using either the osteocalcin or osterix driven cre (not shown). Dicer1 deletion in this genetic context recapitulated some aspects of the bone phenotype	 notably the altered texture and increased volume of cortical bone (supplementary figure 14b	c)	 but did not result in any hematopoietic abnormalities (supplementary figure 14dâ€“h). The data demonstrate that osteoprogenitor cell-specific effects of Dicer1 deletion underlie the disruption of hematopoiesis and indicate that select subsets of cells in the osteoblast lineage have discrete functions in regulating hematopoiesis.  Emergence of leukemia  Human MDS is characterized by transformation to acute myeloid leukemia in a significant subset of patients. Strikingly	 we observed the infrequent occurrence of myeloblastic tumors in OCDfl/fl mice. Four mice were observed to have facial tumors (estimated frequency 2/100 OCDfl/fl animals) of which three animals were available for detailed analysis (figure 4a). Tumors appeared at the age of 2â€“3 weeks and mice died at the age of 4â€“5 weeks. Analyses in a separate cohort of animals demonstrated that dysplastic features were already present in three week old animals (supplementary figure 15)	 suggesting that tumorigenesis occurred in the context of existing dysplasia. Histological examination of the tumors established a diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma (figure 4b)	 a soft-tissue complication of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Dicer1 had not been deleted in these myeloid sarcomas as determined by genomic PCR (figure 4c). Comparative genomic hybridization to germline DNA revealed genetic abnormalities in all tumors	 providing direct evidence that the micro-environment facilitated clonal evolution of tumor cells (figure 4d and supplementary figure 16). Cytogenetic abnormalities included amplification of a common (27 Kb) region on chromosome 14qC1 in two tumors	 the biological relevance of which	 in the absence of known genes related to tumorigenesis in this region	 is under investigation.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Myeloid sarcoma and acute myelogenous leukemia in OCD fl/fl mice The myeloid sarcomas displayed infiltrative behavior into surrounding tissues (supplementary figure 17) and were diagnosed in a context of myelocytosis (figure 4e)	 anemia (figure 4f)	 profound splenomegaly with infiltration of blasts (figure 4g	h) and a marked increase in blasts with a monocytic appearance in blood and bone marrow (figure 4iâ€“k). This combination of findings strongly resembles monoblastic AML (FAB subtype AML M4/M5) in humans and fulfilled all criteria for the diagnosis of AML in mice12. Although the presence of myeloid sarcoma and acute monocytic leukemia-like disease in OCDfl/fl mice was sporadic	 myeloid sarcomas were never observed in OCDfl/+ or Osx-Cre- mice (which were four-fold more abundant than mutant animals) and the occurrence of spontaneous AML in mice at an age of 2â€“3 weeks is unprecedented to our knowledge. Taken together	 these data demonstrate that disruption of Dicer1 from cells of the osteoblastic lineage causes myelodysplasia in mice recapitulating key characteristics of human MDS	 including the propensity to develop AML.  Deletion of Shwachman-Diamond-Bodian Syndrome gene  To obtain insight into the genes and molecular pathways in osteolineage cells driving the disruption of hematopoiesis in OCDfl/fl mice	 we performed gene expression profiling of primary OCDfl/+ and OCDfl/fl osteolineagecells (GFP+CD45âˆ’linâˆ’CD31âˆ’). Microarray analysis revealed a broad changes in the transcriptome in OCDfl/fl osteolineage cells with differential expression of 656 genes (p-value â‰¤ 0.05	 Studentâ€™s t test) representing a wide array of functional groups (supplementary table 1). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed significant enrichment (FDR < 0.05) of genes involved in early osteoblastic differentiation and commitment 21	 including the Wnt/Î²catenin9 and TGF-Î² signaling pathway22	 in OCDfl/+ samples (supplementary table 2). Notably differentially expressed genes and pathways further included stress response genes and cytokines (supplementary tables 2 and 3) with significant downregulation of the Shwachman-Diamond-Bodian Syndrome gene (Sbds) (2.43-fold; p=0.028	 table S1) of particular interest because of its association with human disease. Inactivating mutations in the Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond Syndrome (Sbds) gene are highly associated with the clinical syndrome23 characterized by skeletal abnormalities	 bone marrow failure with mild myelodysplastic changes	 the propensity to develop MDS and secondary AML	 increased intramedullary apoptosis of hematopoietic progenitors and exocrine pancreatic dysfunction. Studies knocking down the Sbds gene in hematopoietic progenitor subsets have failed to recapitulate key features of the clinical phenotype24 and a role of the bone marrow micro-environment in the pathogenesis of the syndrome has been suggested25. Targeted deletion of Sbds from osteoprogenitor cells by intercrossing Osterix-Cre mice to mice containing conditional (floxed) Sbds alleles (figure 5a) (S. Zhang et al	 manuscript submitted) resulted in altered texture of the cortical bone (supplemental figure 18a)	 leukopenia and lymphopenia (but not neutropenia) (figure 5b)	 dysplastic features of neutrophils in the peripheral blood (figure 5c) and micromegakaryocytes (figure 5d) with increased vascularity of the bone marrow (figure 5e). Further similarities with OCDfl/fl mice included decreased frequency of B-cells and B-cell progenitors (supplementary figure 18b)	 increased frequency of myeloid cells (supplementary figure 18c) and intramedullary apoptosis of hematopoietic progenitor cells (figure 5f). Collectively	 the data show that conditional deletion of Sbds from osteoprogenitor cells recapitulates key characteristics of OCDfl/fl mice and implicate osteoprogenitor cells in the pathogenesis of the Shwachman-Diamond syndrome.  Figure 5 Figure 5 Targeted deletion of the Sbds gene from osteoprogenitor cells recapitulates many features of the OCD fl/fl phenotype Go to: DISCUSSION These studies show that specific changes in specific mesenchymal cells of the hematopoietic microenvironment may be sufficient to initiate a complex phenotype of disordered homeostasis with similarities to myelodysplasia	 a poorly understood human disease. Further	 we demonstrate the ability of this abnormality to result in the emergence of a clonal neoplasm in a cell type of clearly distinct lineage with distinct secondary genetic changes. The data indicate that individual	 well defined	 mesenchymal microenvironment constituents can be primary enablers of neoplastic changes in a heterologous cell type.  While a series of genetic and epigenetic events in a single cell may be necessary for oncogenesis	 they may not be sufficient and a permissive microenvironment has been hypothesized to be required for frank malignancy to emerge26. Examples of microenvironmental contributions to neoplasia include a necessary mast cell contribution to Nf1 induced neurofibromas27 and mesenchymal cell alteration of epithelial tumor growth kinetics28	29. Changes in a tissue microenvironment have also been suggested to precede and promote the initiation of genetic events by creating a â€œpre-malignantâ€ state characterized by disruption of quiescence inducing signals or increases in proliferative signaling30	31. This has been validated experimentally with altered TGF-Î² signaling in tissue fibroblasts32 and with myeloid progenitor expansion following RAR-Î³ deletion in bone marrow or Rb deficiency in hematopoietic and microenvironmental cells33	34.  Our findings further the paradigm of malignancy resulting from the interplay of cell autonomous and microenvironmentally determined events and point to the microenvironment as the site of the initiating event that leads to secondary genetic changes in other cells. It is therefore possible to envision a â€˜niche-basedâ€™ model of oncogenesis whereby a change in a specific microenvironmental cell can serve as the primary moment in a multi-step process toward malignancy of a supported	 but distinct cell type. Signals from the microenvironment may select for subsequent transforming events and therefore such signals may represent candidate therapeutic targets in both treatment and prevention strategies.  Whether osteoprogenitor cell abnormalities play a role in the pathogenesis of human MDS and leukemia cannot be discerned from our studies. MDS is a heterogeneous disorder in which cytogenetics can be normal or reveal specific clonal lesions such as deletion of 5q. A role for the microenvironment in MDS has been raised	 and reduced osteoblast surface and unchanged bone volume similar to our OCDfl/fl model has been reported35. Our findings raise the possibility that microenvironmental alterations may precede and facilitate clonal evolution in MDS. Studies examining patient samples will explore this possibility.  The Sbds studies provide further suggestive links to human disease. The human syndrome combines features seen in our model and raises the issue of whether both the pathophysiology of the disorder and the difficulty in treating this syndrome with bone marrow transplantation is in part due to a microenvironmental defect in the bone marrow.  The function of Sbds is itself unclear	 but it has been implicated in ribosomal biogenesis23 and may therefore share with Dicer1 the ability to modulate the gene expression â€˜landscape.â€™ While we pursued Sbds because its expression was decreased in the absence of Dicer1	 levels in OCSfl/fl are likely to be even lower and as a consequence	 may not faithfully portray the role of Sbds in our model. We therefore regard Sbds as a candidate participant in the phenotype of OCDfl/fl mice	 but further studies will be needed to define the collaborating molecules causing the hematopoietic abnormalities.  These studies were initiated focusing on the stem cell niche	 but the results indicate that individual microenvironment constituents can serve as regulators of tissue functions beyond that of stem cell support. Osteoprogenitor dysfunction induced altered proliferation and differentiation of both HSCs and distinct hematopoietic progenitor subsets and induced changes in the tissue architecture. Within a tissue microenvironment	 certain elements may have far broader	 integrative functions as the osteoprogenitor cells did here. There may be a hierarchy of activity within niche components as well as the cells they regulate. Our studies provide the rationale for further exploration of the complexity of mesenchymal â€˜stromaâ€™ and the role specific mesenchymal subsets may play as primary regulators of normal and disordered tissue function.

B6.SJL-Ptprca Pep3b/BoyJ mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory.  Transplantation  For competitive transplantation	 5 Ã— 105 bone-marrow cells from 6-week-old OCD fl/+ or OCD fl/fl (CD45.2) littermates admixed with 5 Ã— 105 CD45.1+ (competitor) WT cells were injected into lethally irradiated (9 Gy	 split dose) BL6-SJL (CD45.1+) mice. For â€œ wt into mutantâ€ experiments	 wildtype congenic BL6/SJL (CD45.1+) bone marrow cells (1 Ã— 106 cells/recipient) were transplanted into lethally irradiated 4 week old OCD fl/+ and OCD fl/fl (CD45.2+) recipients. For â€œ mutant into wtâ€ experiments	 OCD fl/+ or OCD fl/fl (CD45.2+) were transplanted into lethally irradiated 4 week old BL6/SJL(CD45.1+) animals. Donor cell engraftment was confirmed by FACS.   Abstract Numerous studies have implicated microRNAs (miRNAs) in cancer initiation and progression. In contrast	 only recently has attention been focused on the pathway that generates these regulatory molecules. The identification of neoplasia-associated germline mutations in DICER1 has focused translational research on components of the miRNA processing pathway. Deciphering of the many links between miRNA processing perturbations and cancer will likely provide insights into mechanisms of cancer control. Like microRNAs (miRNAs)	 the miRNA processing pathway (Fig. 1) has been implicated in diseases that affect a variety of tissue types from nearly every human organ studied. Considering that a single mutation in any component of the miRNA processing machinery has the potential to modify the entire miRNA profile of a cell or tissue	 it is not surprising that a broad range of cancers has been associated with deregulation of this crucial regulatory pathway. In this Perspective	 we focus on DICER1	 a miRNA processing protein that plays a central role in epigenetic modulation of gene expression.

Step 1: An RNA polymerase II enzyme is responsible for reverse transcription of the gene	 and the resulting molecule is a single-stranded RNA with a stem-loop secondary structure called the primary miRNA (pri-miRNA). Step 2: The pri-miRNA is processed within the nucleus by RNASEN and DGCR8	 which combine to form the microprocessor complex. Step 3: The resulting RNA molecule is termed preliminary miRNA (pre-miRNA). Step 4: Exportin-5 binds pre-miRNA and shuttles the molecules through nuclear pores to the cytoplasm	 a process that requires Ras-related nuclear protein (RAN)	 a guanosine triphosphatase. Step 5: In cooperation with its cofactor TRBP	 DICER1 functions in a manner analogous to the nuclear microprocessing complex by measuring the necessary length of the miRNA and cutting the pre-miRNA to mature 20- to 22- nt strands. Step 6: The resulting mature miRNA is then passed on to a member of the Argonaute family and other participating proteins	 including Gemin3	 Gemin4	 and GW-182. Step 7: Argonaute binds the miRNA and forms RISC	 a group of proteins that is directed to the mRNA transcript to be silenced and either cuts the transcript to prevent translation or recruits other proteins to block translation.  CREDIT: B. STRAUCH/SCIENCE TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE PINPOINTING THE PLAYERS miRNA biogenesis is initiated in the nucleus and terminated in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1). To process a miRNA molecule	 a precursor must first be reverse-transcribed from miRNA-encoding genes (Fig. 1	 step 1) by miRNA polymerase II. The resulting molecule is a single-stranded RNA with stem-loop secondary structure. In step 2	 this primary RNA (pri-miRNA) is processed within the nucleus by ribonuclease III (RNASEN	 also known as DROSHA) and the product of the DGCR8 gene (DiGeorge critical syndrome region gene 8	 also known as PASHA)	 which together form the microprocessor complex. RNASEN cuts the pri-miRNA stem	 leaving a shorter stem-loop structure called the preliminary miRNA (pre-miRNA) (Fig. 1	 step 3) (1). The production of pre-miRNA marks the end of the nuclear component of miRNA biogenesis	 necessitating pre-miRNA transport to the cytoplasm. In step 4	 the exportin-5 karyopherin protein (XPO-5) binds pre-miRNA and shuttles the molecules through nuclear pores into the cytoplasm (1). The pre-miRNA is then cleaved (Fig. 1	 step 5) into a 20- to 22-nucleotide (nt) strand of mature miRNA by the endonuclease DICER1. In cooperation with its cofactor	 transactivation response (TAR) RNAâ€“binding protein (TRBP) (1)	 DICER1 functions in a manner parallel to the microprocessor complex by measuring the necessary length of the miRNA and cutting the pre-miRNA to meet the specification (1). The resulting mature miRNA is then passed on to a member of the Argonaute family of proteins (Fig. 1	 step 6) and	 together with cofactors that include GEMIN3 (2)	 GEMIN4 (2)	 and the glycine-tryptophan protein of 182 kD (GW-182) (3)	 Argonaute binds the miRNA (Fig. 1	 step 7) and forms the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). This complex represents a group of proteins that is directed by the miRNA to the mRNA transcript to be silenced and either cuts the transcript to prevent translation or recruits other proteins to block translation (1).  Although the canonical pathway is described in Fig. 1	 processing steps once thought to be essential to miRNA biogenesis can be bypassed in special cases: miRNA production can proceed from pre-miRNA to miRNA by using Argonaute2 (Ago2) slicer activity instead of DICER1 (4	 5). This deviation from the canonical flow was demonstrated only for a small number of miRNAs	 but the detection of this shortcut highlights the relatively limited understanding of the absolute requirement for each component of miRNA biogenesis and of the dynamic interactions among them. TENTATIVE TIES TO TUMORS Numerous studies have attempted to associate the concentrations or functions of miRNA pathway components with cancer prognosis (Fig. 2). For example	 in lung cancer	 low amounts of DICER1 mRNA	 as measured with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays	 are associated with a poorer prognosis when compared with cancers in patients with elevated DICER1 mRNA concentrations (6	 7). Low DICER1 expression was also noted in advanced breast tumors	 in which quantitative PCR demonstrated that decreased expression is associated with aggressive	 metastasis-prone tumors and that higher expression correlates with longer survival time (7â€“9). A pattern of down-regulation of both RNASEN and DICER1 is also associated with poor-prognosis skin	 lung	 breast	 and ovarian cancers	 among others (Fig. 2) (6â€“11).

BCC	 basal cell carcinoma; AML	 acute myeloid leukemia.  CREDIT: B. STRAUCH/SCIENCE TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE Analysis of prostate cancers shows overexpression of XPO-5	 DICER1	 and AGO2 in metastatic lesions (12)	 whereas RNASEN is up-regulated in advanced-stage cervical cancers (13) and metastasis-prone	 poor-survival esophageal cancers (14) (Fig. 2). DICER1 is overexpressed in precursor lesions of lung cancers (adenomatous hyperplasias) as compared with advanced tumors (15)	 in some oral cancers (16)	 and in a cohort of acute myeloid leukemias (17)	 but no link has been found between expression and outcome in the latter two cancers. Curiously	 mucoepidermoid cancers arising in the throat or upper esophagus exhibit	 through immunohistochemistry	 both over- and under-expression of DICER1 when compared with normal tissues from the throat and esophagus (18). Bladder cancers also exhibit a dual pattern of expression	 in which DGCR8 was found to be down-regulated in premalignant tissue and up-regulated in malignant tissue	 whereas the opposite is true for RNASEN	 DICER1	 and XPO-5 (19).  These divergent results across different cancers suggest that there are tissue-specific effects associated with aberrant expression patterns of miRNA pathway genes	 but the wide variation in the findings may also be explained in part by technical differences among the studies. Notably	 the results of immunohistochemical studies should be interpreted with caution given that a more recent study was unable to show a relationship between DICER1 mRNA levels and antibody-staining intensity in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues for many of the available antibodies to DICER1; at the mRNA level	 no correlation was found between DICER1 or RNASEN expression and outcomes in breast cancers uniformly treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy	 but these authors noted a down-regulation in certain tumor subgroups	 including triple-negative breast cancers (20). Also	 melanomas	 breast and ovarian cancers	 and some cancer cell lines display copy number alterations (both gains and losses) in miRNA-encoding genes and in RNASEN	 DGCR8	 XPO-5	 DICER1	 and AGO (21). ALL IN THE FAMILY DICER1 currently stands as the sole member of the miRNA pathway in which germline mutations have been found to predispose the carrier to human disease. Mutations in DICER1 were first identified in 11 of 11 children with the rare pediatric tumor pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB)	 a neoplasm of the mesenchyme tissue of the lung or pleural cavity; all of these patients had a family history of PPB or the related familial tumorâ€“dysplasia syndrome	 which together are referred to as PPB-FTDS (22) [Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) no. 601200]. PPB-FTDS includes a variety of diverse tumor types	 principally PPB; cystic nephroma (CN	 a rare	 benign tumor in the kidney); embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS	 a neoplasm of the connective tissue); ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors	 especially Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors (SLCT)	 which originate from gonadal stromal tissue; and multinodular goiter (MNG	 benign nodules of thyroid tissue) (23).  The finding of germline mutations in children with PPB prompted recent studies that identified germline mutations in individuals with tumors that fall within the PPB-FTDS spectrum	 even when PPB itself was absent from family members (24â€“26). Notably	 DICER1 is situated at the genetic locus associated with familial multinodular goiter (MNG1)	 which was previously localized to chromosome 14q (27). In the largest family analyzed (20 affected individuals and no other reported illnesses)	 goiter segregates completely with a singleâ€“amino acid substitution in DICER1	 which is predicted to be deleterious (26). Furthermore	 DICER1 is the genetic explanation for the previously identified link between SLCT and MNG (28)	 with deleterious germline DICER1 mutations found in all three families that exhibit both conditions (26).  Another family contained a female who developed both Wilms tumor (WT) at 8 years of age and bilateral SLCT at 12 years of age (25). Overall	 however	 only 4 of 297 children with WT have been found to carry germline DICER1 mutations	 suggesting a very modest contribution to the incidence of WT (24	25	 29)	 especially when family members do not display any of the other diseases more typically associated with DICER1 mutations.  There have also been four cases of cervical embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (cERMS)	 another rare embryonal tumor	 occurring in families with DICER1 mutations (29). In addition to these tumors	 there have been single cases of other DICER1-associated tumor types	 such as intraocular medulloepthelioma (IM)	 an exceptionally rare embryonal tumor of the eye	 which occurred in a child with PPB and a DICER1 mutation (25); together with an earlier report from the PPB registry that documented four instances of IM among PPB families	 this finding suggests a strong etiological link between DICER1 and IM (30). No loss of heterozygosity of the wild-type allele has been detected in several types of tumors studied thus far. The importance of this observation is explained below.  The tissue-specific phenotypes of deleterious germline DICER1 mutations remain unexplained. At least one family exclusively exhibits the benign phenotype of MNG	 whereas others exhibit only PPB	 CN	 or SLCT. Also	 the penetrance of DICER1 mutations is extremely variable; some mutations are highly penetrant	 as in an MNG family in which the disease phenotype was present in all 20 individuals with DICER1 mutations (26)	 when compared with another study in which only 8 of 25 individuals who harbor a DICER1 mutation exhibit a disease phenotype (MNG	 SLCT	 or CN) (25). In this study	 the genomic DNA of 823 individuals with PPB spectrum tumors and 781 cancer cell lines derived from 50 different cancer types were sequenced	 and the data revealed DICER1 mutations in 44 individuals from 19 families; of these	 26 presented with diseases that are likely or very likely to be associated with the DICER1 mutation present	 demonstrating moderate penetrance for these mutations.  The contribution of DICER1 mutations to the different tumor types is variable	 with a high proportion of individuals with PPB (11 of 14) and SLCT (4 of 7) harboring DICER1 mutations as compared with a low proportion of individuals with WT displaying DICER1 mutations (1 of 243) (25). Furthermore	 there is no obvious relationship between the mutation type or location along the DICER1 gene and the type of disease observed. The question of whom to screen for DICER1 mutations remains unanswered	 but certainly one should be strongly suspicious if any of the conditions described above (except perhaps WT) are present	 even in the absence of a family history of such disorders. HAPLO-INSUFFICIENT BUT NULL-SUFFICIENT? Mouse models suggest that Dicer1 may function as a haplo-insufficient tumor suppressorâ€”that is	 a gene product whose normal function is to inhibit or control cell division in which one active gene copy alone does not produce enough product to prevent tumor formation and proliferation. In parallel studies	 two research groups demonstrated that loss of a single allele of Dicer1 in mice fosters enhanced tumor proliferation (and even cancer initiation) in models of retinoblastoma (a tumor caused by mutations in the tumor suppressorâ€“encoding Rb-1 gene) and lung cancer caused by a mutation in the Kras protooncogene; however	 both studies also showed that loss of the second allele did not result in increased tumor proliferation	 but rather	 stunted tumor growth almost entirely (31	 32). This is an especially interesting result considering a recent study that showed that retinal cell degeneration in age-related macular degeneration results from a Dicer1 deficiency because Dicer1 protects retinal cells from the degenerative effects of toxic Alu RNA accumulation (Alu sequences are repetitive DNA elements	 originally defined by the Alu restriction endonuclease) (33). It is possible that the retinal degeneration observed by Lambertz et al. (31) might be caused	 not by an miRNA dysregulation effect	 but instead by the loss of Dicer1 function as an Alu RNAâ€“depletion agent. Results such as these weaken the notion that DICER1 dysfunction in cancer is mediated solely by dysregulation of miRNA processing.  The DICER1 haplo-insufficiency model represents a previously unknown and perplexing mechanism	 considering the standard behavior for tumor suppressors. Classical tumor suppressor genes function by producing a protein that inhibits tumor growth	 and one functioning copy of these genes is sufficient for tumor suppression. However	 when the second copy is lost	 the suppressing function is lost	 and tumor growth is enhanced. If the proposed hapli-insuffiency mouse model is correct and also applies to humans	 promotion of tumor growth would be conditional on the presence of one wild-type DICER1 allele	 representing a unique situation among tumor suppressors. This mechanism is supported by the absence of loss of heterozygosity of the wild-type alleleâ€”that is	 loss of the normal function (in this case	 loss of tumor suppression) of the second allele of a gene in the context of one inactive alleleâ€”in human tumors that arise in DICER1-mutation carriers (22	24	 26). In DICER1-related tumors	 there currently are no data to indicate that the second wild-type allele has been inactivated.  The haplo-insufficiency hypothesis is challenged by the observation that the amounts of DICER1 mRNA and the corresponding protein in lymphocytes do not correlate with allelic status (26); under a model in which half-dosage is permissive for tumorigenesis	 one would expect that individuals with only one functioning DICER1 allele (as a result of a deleterious germline DICER1 mutation) would	 on average	 have lower levels of mRNA and protein in their lymphocytes than those of individuals with no mutations in DICER1. These findings suggest that operational feedback loops between DICER1 and miRNAs that can themselves feed back and inhibit DICER1 messenger transcript translation	 such as let-7 and miR-103/107 (34	 35)	 may render a strict haplo-insufficiency model overly simplistic.  Perhaps a germline mutation of a DICER1 allele serves as an initial contributing hit in a model in which a single DICER1 mutation is coupled with tissue-specific effects	 such as gain- or loss-of-function of other cancer genes	 to foster proliferation (as was seen in the Rb-1 and Kras- driven mouse retinoblastoma and lung cancer models	 respectively). Moreover	 second hits in DICER1 itself have not been ruled out. In this way	 DICER1 mutations would create a sensitized background that lowers the threshold needed for tumors to develop. However	 the universal importance of a gene such as DICER1 coupled with the extreme rarity of most of the diseases to which mutations in the gene have been linked is paradoxical	 because a sensitized background should	 in theory	 increase the likelihood of tumor development in general and thus be associated with common cancers. Perhaps such an effect is developmental stageâ€“dependent; many of the DICER1-associated tumors are embryonal or blastoma-type pediatric tumors. Thus	 alterations in the DICER1 gene dose may be most influential when cells are in an undecided fate state. ITâ€™S NOT JUST DICER â€¦ Although DICER1 is the only part of the miRNA processing pathway for which germline mutations have been identified	 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and somatic mutations in other pathway components have been associated with disease or disease progression. An allele of the RNASEN gene that contains six specific SNPs was associated with poor prognosis after lung cancer resection This result was reinforced when an association was found between the same RNASEN haplotype and reduced survival in a several cohorts of patients with early-stage resectable lung cancers (36).  Furthermore	 eight distinct RNASEN SNPs (different from the six SNPs in the previously mentioned study) were associated with primary tumor recurrence in head and neck cancers	 with the likelihood of recurrence increasing with the number of risk-associated SNPs present (37). In this study	 high-risk individuals (more than nine risk-associated SNPs	 including the eight within RNASEN) showed an average time of ~28 months to recurrence	 compared with more than 93 months among low-risk groups (zero to four risk-associated SNPs). However	 this study used a smaller sample set (150 patients)	 with no replication in an independent patient cohort. SNPs in XPO-5 were also found to be associated with modified risk of esophageal cancer (38). Although these studies demonstrate potentially interesting links between intragenic SNPs and disease state or outcome	 none of the studies investigated functional differences associated with the presence of the SNPs at the molecular level.  Germline mutations in genes that regulate DNA mismatch repair cause chromosomal instability and can result in Lynch syndrome	 which is characterized by high lifetime risks of colorectal	 endometrial	 and other cancers. Failure of DNA mismatch repair processes can cause tumor-promoting insertions and deletions (indels) in microsatellite DNAâ€”short (oneâ€“ to sixâ€“base pair)	 simple DNA sequence repeats in the human genomeâ€”which is a manifestation of the underlying genetic instability. Somatic frameshift mutations in XPO-5 in microsatellite-unstable endometrial cancer lead to an inability to transport pre-miRNA from the nucleus into the cytoplasm	 resulting in a near-complete loss of miRNA (39). Upon the screening of 337 tumors	 somatic mutations in XPO-5 were found in 26% of colorectal cancers that arose as a part of Lynch syndrome	 22% of sporadic colon tumors	 28% of sporadic gastric tumors	 and 13% of sporadic endometrial tumors. A study of the colorectal cancer cell line HCT-15	 which harbors a somatic mutation in XPO-5	 demonstrated a complete lack of miRNA in the cytoplasm	 and these cells rapidly formed tumors when injected into mice	 a trait that was greatly diminished with the introduction of a vector that expressed wild-type XPO-5 (39).  In a similar study by the same group	 somatic mutations were detected in TARBP2 (the gene that encodes TRBP	 a DICER1 cofactor) in colorectal and endometrial tumors and in gastric cancer cell lines that exhibit microsatellite instability (40). In 282 primary malignancies	 26% were found to harbor TARBP2 mutations: 43% (13/30) of colorectal tumors arose as part of Lynch syndrome (and hence microsatellite-unstable)	 25% (53 of 209) of sporadic colorectal tumors	 and 14% (6 of 43) of sporadic gastric tumors.  Cells with a TARBP2 mutation have a reduced capacity to generate miRNA as compared with their wild-type counterparts. Injection of human colon carcinoma TRBP-deficient cells into athymic	 nude mice results in tumor growth	 which is slowed when wild-type cells are introduced	 implying that in this model a functional version of TRBP is required for colon tumor suppression. Because TRBP is a cofactor for and stabilizer of DICER1 (41)	 and lowered DICER1 expression has been linked to the development of advanced endometrial cancers (42)	 mutations in TARBP2 in endometrial cancers could potentially contribute to pathogenesis by reducing the capacity of DICER1 to create mature miRNAs	 which in turn causes aberrations in the global miRNA profile.  Further along in the pathway (Fig. 1)	 somatic mutations have been reported in AGO2 and TNRC6A (which encodes the Argonaute cofactor GW-182) in microsatellite-unstable colorectal and gastric cancers (43). Here	 somatic AGO2 mutations were reported in 4 of 27 gastric cancers and 6 of 41 colorectal cancers	 and somatic TNRC6A mutations were found in 2 of 27 gastric cancers and 5 of 41 colorectal cancers. Although the tumors with AGO2 mutations showed no substantial difference in immunostaining with an antibody to AGO2 when compared with similar tumors with wild-type AGO2	 tumors that carry a TNRC6A mutation displayed significantly lower amounts of GW-182 protein when compared with similar tumors with wild-type TNRC6A. However	 no associations were detected between TNRC6A expression and clinico-pathological parameters such as tumor stage or grade or patient survival (43); hence	 the clinical and biological importance of these observations remains to be fully elucidated. NEXT IN TRANSLATION Clearly	 the effects of aberrations in the miRNA-processing pathway on cancer initiation and progression are complex. No consistent pattern emerges	 with conflicting data arising from different studies	 particularly in those that assess concentrations of pathway-component mRNAs and proteins. Nevertheless	 it is clear that the miRNA processing pathway plays a crucial role in the initiation and progression of many different cancer types. The ability to therapeutically target individual pathway components involved in tumorigenesis would be an attractive proposition if it could be done with sufficient precision.  At the DNA level	 the disease-association picture is clearer; studies of mutations in genes that encode components of the miRNA processing pathway have revealed unexpected relationships between perturbations in this pathway and human cancers. However	 the rarity of several of the diseases associated with germline mutations in this universally important regulatory pathway	 in combination with an against-the-grain model of haplo-insufficiency for genes such as DICER1	 leaves many unanswered questions. Coupled with studies in patients that characterize the tissue-specific expression of miRNA processing pathway genes	 development of mouse models with relevant mutations should help to clarify the connection between certain cancers and aberrant miRNA maturation	 selected gene silencing	 and tissue-specific effects.  The predominant obstacle to successful translational application of this new knowledge is the broad range of processes that are regulated by even a single miRNA. Nevertheless	 it may be that specific tumors are exquisitely sensitive to the effect of specific miRNAs	 and in those circumstances	 one can envision an miRNA-based therapeutic (44). We speculate that pediatric blastoma-like tumors are the most suitable candidates for such a treatment because these tumors are most consistently associated with germline DICER1 mutations	 and therefore	 they are likely to be susceptible to pertubations in the miRNA pathway. Delivery of miRNAs to selected tumor sites may require novel delivery systems such as the polyethylenimine-based nanoparticles that were recently reported to be effective carriers in a mouse model of colon cancer (45). The next few years should see translational developments at the cutting edge of miRNA processing and cancer research (46). Pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB) is a childhood cancer arising from pleuropulmonary mesenchyme. This neoplasm is a sentinel disease in a familial tumor syndrome recently found to be associated with germline mutations in DICER1. Observations of ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors (OSCST) in PPB kindreds led to further study. We sought to characterize ovarian tumors seen in probands and families with PPB and PPB-related conditions and define germline DICER1 status.  Methods  Patient and family records of pathology-reviewed PPB cases enrolled in the International PPB Registry (IPPBR) were searched for ovarian tumors. Ovarian tumor pathology specimens were obtained and centrally-reviewed. Germline DNA from patients with ovarian tumors was tested for DICER1 mutations. Three additional OSCST patients registered in the IPPBR were also tested for mutations in DICER1.  Results  Among 296 kindreds including 325 children with PPB	 we observed 3 children with both PPB and Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors (SLCT)/Sertoli cell tumors. Among family members of PPB patients	 we identified 6 OSCST (3 SLCT	 1 Sertoli cell tumor	 1 juvenile granulosa cell tumor	 1 gynandroblastoma). Age at ovarian tumor diagnosis was youngest in PPB probands and younger in family members than in OSCST in general. Germline DICER1 mutations were identified in 4 of 6 patients with OSCST from PPB kindreds and in 2 of 3 children with OSCST and no personal or family history of PPB.  Conclusions  Primary ovarian neoplasms	 particularly OSCST	 are a manifestation of the familial PPB syndrome and may be the initial clinical presentation of DICER1 mutations within a family.  Keywords: sex cord-stromal tumors	 ovary	 cancer	 DICER1 Go to: BACKGROUND Pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB) is the most common primary lung cancer of childhood.[1] It is the pulmonary analog of other dysontogenetic or embryonal neoplasms in this age group such as Wilms' tumor	 neuroblastoma	 retinoblastoma and others. PPB is genetically determined in approximately 70% of cases [2	 3] and is associated with a distinctive inherited tumor predisposition syndrome. Approximately 30% â€“ 35% of kindreds in which a child has been diagnosed with PPB have findings consistent with the PPB Family Tumor and Dysplasia Syndrome (OMIM #601200) which includes PPB	 pulmonary cysts with pathologic features of involuted or regressed PPBs	 cystic nephroma	 other soft tissue sarcomas	 nasal chondromesenchymal hamartoma	 nodular hyperplasia and carcinoma of the thyroid gland	 ciliary body medulloepithelioma and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma of the uterine cervix [4â€“8].  Familial PPB is associated with germline mutations in DICER1 [9]. DICER1 encodes an enzyme required for the production of mature microRNAs (miRNAs) [10]. miRNAs are important regulators of gene expression and are critical in normal organ development [11].  The current study is based upon the identification of several cases of ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors (OSCST) in PPB kindreds. OSCST arise from the mesenchymal or interstitial stroma whose differentiated elements include granulosa cells and other specialized supporting elements. The specific tumor types in the OSCST category are Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors (SLCT)	 granulosa cell tumors (juvenile and adult)	 Sertoli cell tumors	 thecoma-fibroma and gynandroblastoma. Gynandroblastoma is a unique tumor	 having both SLCT and juvenile granulosa tumor components [12]. Both PPB and OSCST are rare neoplasms and their precise incidence is difficult to determine from the literature.  In this study we present our investigation of the associations between PPB	 OSCST and germline DICER1 mutations.  Go to: METHODS Human subjects sample collection  The records of families enrolled in the International PPB Registry (IPPBR	 www.ppbregistry.org) were reviewed for proband and/or family member history of ovarian neoplasms. Central review of PPB pathology (LPD	 DAH) was required for IPPBR enrollment. Ovarian tumor histopathology was centrally-reviewed (MCP	 LPD	 DAH). All study protocols were approved by participating institutional human subjects committees. All participants providing germline samples for DICER1 sequencing provided written consent for the molecular and family history studies as approved by the Human Research Protection Offices at Washington University in St. Louis	 MO and Childrenâ€™s National Medical Center in Washington	 DC. Medical records	 blood	 saliva and tumor specimens were collected from PPB probands	 affected family members and other relatives. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes or saliva using standard protocols. Family histories were obtained by treating physicians and IPPBR staff. Three children with OSCST from two families without a history of PPB were also included in this report as they were referred to the IPPBR based on clinical suspicion for genetically-determined OSCST.  Sequence analysis of germline or tumor DNA  DICER1 sequences were extracted from the public draft human genome database (NM_177438) and used as a reference sequence for assembly and primer construction. Primers were designed to amplify all of the coding exons including intron-exon boundaries (Supplemental Table 1). PCR reactions were performed using genomic DNA. The resultant products were purified and directly sequenced using BigDye Terminator chemistry (v3.1 Applied Biosystems	 Valencia CA) and the ABI3730 sequencer (Applied Biosystems). For a subset of cases	 we used high throughput sequencing services (Agencourt	 BeckmanCoulter Genomics	 Danvers MA). The sequence traces were assembled and scanned for variations using Sequencher version 4.8 (Gene Codes	 Ann Arbor	 MI) and visual inspection of chromatograms. Variants were queried against the SNP database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/). SIFT and Polyphen algorithms were used to assess the potential significance of predicted novel amino acid substitutions (http://blocks.fhcrc.org/sift/SIFT.html) [13].  Go to: RESULTS Clinical Characteristics  Among 325 patients from 296 families with PPB enrolled in the IPPBR	 we identified 9 patients or close relatives with an OSCST(Table 1). These included seven Sertoli-Leydig tumors	 one juvenile granulosa cell tumor and one gynandroblastoma. In three families	 the proband with PPB was also diagnosed with an ovarian Sertoli-Leydig tumor (ages at diagnosis 6	 8 and 13 years). These three children had received chemotherapy and surgery for PPB 5	 6 and 11 years prior to ovarian tumor diagnosis respectively. Six OSCST were diagnosed in first or second-degree relatives of a child with PPB. Ages at diagnosis for OSCST in these family members were 2	4	7	15	 18 and 32 years (median	 11 years) (Table 1). An ovarian dysgerminoma was seen in a third-degree relative of a PPB patient. No other ovarian tumors were confirmed.  Table 1 Table 1 Ovarian tumors in PPB probands and family members. For the children with no personal or family history of PPB	 two were sisters	 one diagnosed with juvenile granulosa cell tumor and the other with gynandroblastoma (Table 1). Interestingly	 a lung cyst was identified in the sister with juvenile granulosa cell tumor (Fig. 1). The third child developed bilateral ovarian tumors: a poorly differentiated sarcoma with limited myogenic differentiation (age 10 years) and subsequently a Sertoli-Leydig tumor of the contralateral ovary without heterologous elements (age 14 years).  Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Lung cyst discovered at age 16 years in child with juvenile granulosa cell tumor (Case 11). Such cysts discovered after age 8 years in patients with PPB-associated conditions are very likely benign cystic variants of PPB [3]. All three children with PPB and OSCST underwent complete surgical resection of SLCT; one child also received chemotherapy. All are alive and without evidence of PPB or SLCT at 1.5 to 6.5 years following the SLCT diagnosis (Table 1). Fewer clinical records are available for family members	 however	 all underwent surgical excision and at least one received chemotherapy. One of these individuals had recurrence of SLCT in lymph nodes and peritoneal surfaces one year after diagnosis	 underwent surgery alone and was alive at last contact	 25 years after the diagnosis of SLCT. All family members with OSCST are alive without evidence of disease at a median of 20.5 years (range	 13 â€“ 45 years) following the ovarian tumor diagnosis.  Pathology and Genetics  The nine OSCST in individuals with PPB (3 cases) or in relatives of those with PPB (6 cases) were all unilateral neoplasms without a predilection for either the right or left ovary. The tumors included five SLCT	 two Sertoli cell tumors	 one juvenile granulosa cell tumor and one gynandroblastoma (Fig. 2). The SLCT were intermediate to poorly-differentiated. One of the SLCT had heterologous elements with enteric-like glands and sarcomatous stroma. One of the two Sertoli cell tumors presented at the age of six years with abdominal pain secondary to torsion of a 8 Ã— 4 Ã— 2 cm hemorrhagic mass in the left ovary (Fig. 3). This child was diagnosed with multiple Type I PPBs at five months of age and a cystic nephroma of the left kidney at eleven months of age. A juvenile granulosa cell tumor was diagnosed at the age of two years in a second degree relative.  Fig. 2 Fig. 2 (4 panel photomicrographs). A. Sertoli cell tumor of the ovary (case 2) shows the pattern of solid cords of uniform basophilic cells. B. Other patterns in the same tumor (case 2) demonstrate small tubules adjacent to retiform or papillary profiles. C. ... Fig. 3 Fig. 3 (gross). Sertoli cell tumor of the ovary (case 2) presented with persistent abdominal pain in a 6-year-old female with the previous history of multiple PPBs and a cystic nephroma of the kidney. The hemorrhagic appearance of this 8 cm ovarian mass reflects ... There were three additional cases of OSCST: a SLCT	 a juvenile granulosa cell tumor and a gynandroblastoma	 in patients who had no history of a PPB in their family	 but had clinical findings suggestive of familial disease; two of these patients had germline DICER1 mutations.  Germline DNA samples were available for 8 of 12 patients described in this report. Six of these eight were found to have a DICER1 mutation. One additional patient with SLCT was found to have an intronic variant of uncertain clinical significance. Because these cases are unusual and clinically distinct and some genetic results were obtained in the research setting	 results have been aggregated where appropriate to prevent unintentional specific disclosure of results. Mutation analysis results are detailed in Table 2. Importantly	 germline DICER1 mutations were seen in patients with SLCT	 juvenile granulosa cell tumors and gynandoblastoma.  Table 2 Table 2 DICER1 mutations in patients described in this report. Go to: DISCUSSION We identified nine individuals with OSCST among PPB probands and their relatives in the IPPBR. Germline DICER1 mutations were seen in 6 of 8 patients in this report.  Because the precise incidence of OSCST and PPB are difficult to ascertain	 we cannot determine the expected incidence of these conditions together in a single patient or in a family kindred. Both conditions are inadequately tabulated in national registries such as Surveillance	 Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) [14]. Between 25 and 50 children are diagnosed with PPB annually in the United States. SLCT comprise less than 1% of ovarian tumors seen in children and adults. It is a reasonable presumption that these two rare cancers occurring in individuals or relatives have a related pathogenesis. Also	 the ovarian tumors seen are predominantly limited to the otherwise rare specific histologic subtype of OSCST with a predominance of SLCT. The ages at diagnosis of SLCT/Sertoli cell tumors for PPB patients (6	 8 and 13 years) and family members (4	7	 15 and 32 years) are generally younger than the age of diagnosis of â€œsporadicâ€ SLCT (mean 25 years) [15]. Although our numbers are small	 these data suggest that SLCTs associated with PPB occur at a younger age than sporadic examples	 as is typical of hereditary tumor predisposition. All of the patients described are alive without evidence of disease	 including one patient who relapsed and underwent surgery	 although the numbers are too small to draw conclusions regarding prognosis.  In addition to the PPB-associated cases	 we identified three children with OSCST for whom there was no personal or family history of PPB	 however clinical findings were suggestive of a genetic tumor predisposition. Two were sisters with OSCST (one with a lung cyst); the third patient had ovarian sarcoma with contralateral OSCST. DICER1 mutations were also seen in this group.  In general	 the pathogenesis of OSCST is unknown	 in part because of the tumorâ€™s rarity. Genetic analyses of tumor tissue have generally shown balanced karyotypes	 with chromosomal imbalances in up to 25%	 occasionally gain of chromosome 12 [16]. Trisomy 8 was seen in one case of metastasizing SLCT [17]. Sex cord-stromal tumors have been described in other genetic syndromes	 suggesting that genetic predisposition is important. Sex cord-stromal tumor with annular tubules are associated with Peutz Jeghers syndrome characterized by the STK11 gene mutation but STK11 gene mutations have not been observed in sporadic OSCST [18]. Juvenile granulosa cell tumors have been described in association with Ollier enchondromatosis and Maffucci syndrome [19].  Four OSCST patients we report had nodular thyroid hyperplasia (NTH) (Table 1). The association of NTH with SLCT has recently been shown to be related to germline mutations in DICER1 [20	 21] lending further support to the association described here. Our research expands these findings to include cases of juvenile granulosa cell tumor and gynandroblastoma and defines a link between PPB	 OSCST and germline DICER1 mutations.  Germ-cell tumors are a separate entity from OSCST. We observed one case of ovarian dysgerminoma in a third-degree relative of a PPB patient. Three seminomas have also been observed in relatives of PPB patients. Germline mutations results were available for one patient with seminoma; we did not find DICER1 mutation. Of 71 patients with seminoma	 Slade et al. identified one DICER1 mutation.[22] It is currently unclear whether the dysgerminoma/seminoma group of gonadal tumors is part of the PPB-related spectrum of diseases.  Our sequence analysis identified heterozygous germline loss of function DICER1 mutations in 4 of 6 patients with PPB-associated OSCST. We also identified a DICER1 mutation in two young sisters with OSCST and no known family or personal history of PPB. On staging chest CT one sister was also found to have a lung cyst (Figure 1)	 likely an occult manifestation of the cystic variant of PPB. [23]. The finding of a lung cyst or one of the PPB-related tumors in a patient or close family member with OSCST should suggest the possibility of germline DICER1 mutation. DICER1 mutations were first identified in PPB patients [9] and have subsequently been seen in other conditions seen in familial PPB cases [3	8	21	 24]. Clinical testing for DICER1 mutation status is available.  Mutations in DICER1 are hypothesized to alter production of mature miRNAs leading to dysregulated gene expression [9	 11]. Because miRNAs are important in controlling many biological functions	 the effects of reduced DICER1 expression in different tissues at different stages of growth	 development or homeostasis may be expected to lead to pleiotropic effects. DICER1 may function as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor [25]. Decreased DICER1 expression in tumor tissue has recently been shown to be associated with poorer prognosis in adults with epithelial ovarian cancer [13]. The role of germline DICER1 mutations and downstream implications for miRNA expression in presumed sporadic OSCST is not yet clear. DICER1 mutations are not found in all cases of PPB or OSCST and many carriers of DICER1 mutations are phenotypically normal	 thus other genetic factors are also likely to be important in these conditions.  The PPB Family Tumor and Dysplasia Syndrome phenotype includes PPB	 lung cysts	 cystic nephroma	 OSCST (especially SLCT) as described here	 thyroid nodular hyperplasia (NTH) and differentiated carcinomas	 nasal chondomesenchymal hamartoma	 ciliary body medulloepitheioma and sarcoma botryoides of the uterine cervix as well as more familiar childhood cancers and dysplasias [3]. The importance of detailed family histories is thus apparent	 and co-occurrence in a child or family of any of the PPB-associated illnesses raises the possibility of genetically-determined disease. DICER1 sequencing may be indicated and if such a genetic marker is found	 the at-risk family members can be identified. Because PPB-related diseases affect many organs over the first 20â€“30 years of life and because disease penetrance is low	 disease screening must be very carefully considered. On the other hand	 families and medical professionals should be aware of familial diseases associated with OSCST. Obtaining detailed family histories from patients with OSCST may lead to timely diagnosis of a familial cancer syndrome with important implications for young children within the family. For very young children who carry DICER1 gene mutations	 screening with chest CT scan may be most helpful in early identification of PPB	 which is by far the most lethal tumor seen within this familial tumor syndrome and a tumor in which early detection provides the best opportunity for cure. [26] Clinicians and family members should be alert for signs of an abdominal mass	 pain or signs of hormone production such as precocity or virilization that may herald the presence of an ovarian sex cord-stromal tumor.  From this group of patients we cannot determine the prevalence of germline DICER1 mutations in patients with OSCST in general. Medical or family history of lung cysts	 lung tumors diagnosed at a young age (especially PPB)	 hyperplastic thyroid disease	 gonadal tumors	 cystic nephroma	 intestinal hamartomas	 childhood benign or malignant tumors or SLCT/OSCST diagnosed at a younger than expected age strongly suggest the need for genetic counseling and consideration of DICER1 testing. Studies underway and in development will offer further insights into these important questions.  Go to: CONCLUSIONS We have shown that germline DICER1 mutations may be found in PPB-associated OSCST cases. DICER1 mutations may also be found in other OSCST patients	 including those with SLCT	 juvenile granulosa cell tumor and gynandroblastoma whose clinical presentation suggests genetic predisposition. With this insight	 we seek to gain a better understanding of tumor pathogenesis; thus leading to improved treatments and outcome for women with sporadic OSCST	 which continue to have significant morbidity. Although we have no specific recommendations for screening at this time	 recognition of this clinical association may promote early recognition of ovarian tumor symptoms in a predisposed child or family member.  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have the potential to regulate cellular differentiation programs; however	 miRNA deficiency in primary hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) results in HSC depletion in mice	 leaving the question of whether miRNAs play a role in early-lineage decisions un-answered. To address this issue	 we deleted Dicer1	 which encodes an essential RNase III enzyme for miRNA biogenesis	 in murine CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein Î± (C/EBPA)â€“positive myeloid-committed progenitors in vivo. In contrast to the results in HSCs	 we found that miRNA depletion affected neither the number of myeloid progenitors nor the percentage of C/EBPAâ€“positive progenitor cells. Analysis of gene-expression profiles from wild-type and Dicer1-deficient granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs) revealed that 20 miRNA families were active in GMPs. Of the derepressed miRNA targets in Dicer1-null GMPs	 27% are normally exclusively expressed in HSCs or are specific for multipotent progenitors and erythropoiesis	 indicating an altered gene-expression landscape. Dicer1-deficient GMPs were defective in myeloid development in vitro and exhibited an increased replating capacity	 indicating the regained self-renewal potential of these cells. In mice	 Dicer1 deletion blocked monocytic differentiation	 depleted macrophages	 and caused myeloid dysplasia with morphologic features of Pelger-HuÃ«t anomaly. These results provide evidence for a miRNA-controlled switch for a cellular program of self-renewal and expansion toward myeloid differentiation in GMPs.  Introduction  Hematopoiesis is a tightly regulated process of proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) toward mature blood cells. Lineage commitment and differentiation of HSPCs are orchestrated by transcription factors that are expressed at specific developmental stages. For example	 CCAAT/Enhancer-Binding Protein-Alpha (C/EBPA) is a master regulatory transcription factor that is not expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)	 but starts to be expressed in a small fraction of multipotent progenitor (MPP) cells and increases steeply during the transition from the common myeloid progenitor (CMP) toward the GMP. C/EBPA drives granulopoiesis by controlling the expression of myeloid-specific genes.1â€“2  miRNAs belong to a class of small (approximately 22 nt) noncoding RNAs. The RNA-induced silencing complexâ€“bound miRNAs bind to complementary sequences that are predominantly located in the 3â€²-untranslated regions of target mRNAs and regulate gene expression by transcript destabilization and inhibition of protein translation.3 Recently	 the function of miRNAs in myeloid cells has been investigated using mouse models. For example	 miRs-17/20/93/106 promote progenitor cell expansion by targeting Sequestosome-1â€“regulated pathways.4 In addition	 miR-223 negatively regulates myeloid progenitor proliferation and fine-tunes granulocyte differentiation and activity.5 In addition	 miR-146a inhibits the activity of both myeloid and lymphoid cell lineages and plays key roles in the regulation of inflammation.6  DICER1 is an evolutionarily conserved member of the RNase III family of endoribonucleases that is critical for processing of specific precursor hairpin sequences	 the so-called pre-miRNAs	 into miRNAs.7 Genetic deletion of Dicer1 in mice results in early embryonic mortality due to depletion of the Oct-4â€“positive pluripotent embryonic stem cell pool at embryonic day 6-7 (E6-E7).8 A floxed Dicer1 allele (Dicer1fl) has been generated that allows conditional deletion of Dicer1 in a cell type- and developmental stageâ€“specific fashion.9 Hematopoietic lineageâ€“specific conditional deletion of Dicer1 has revealed the involvement of miRNAs in the survival	 maturation	 and homeostasis of peripheral T lymphocytes and in Ab diversity and survival of B lymphocytes.10â‡“â€“12 In addition	 conditional Dicer1 deletion in osteoprogenitors using mice that have Cre recombinase under the transcriptional control of the osterix promoter (Osx-GFP-Cre) results in myeloid dysplasia and acute myelogenous leukemia with acquired genetic abnormalities but intact Dicer1.13  Mouse primary HSCs are impaired by Dicer1 loss and are unable to reconstitute hematopoiesis.14 In addition	 conditional deletion of Ars2	 another gene required for miRNA biogenesis	 in HSCs results in BM failure and increased apoptosis of hematopoietic cells in thymus and spleen.15 Therefore	 the overall contribution of miRNAs to myeloid-lineage specification remains elusive. To address this issue	 we generated a myeloid-specific	 Cebpa-Creâ€“driven Dicer1 deleter mouse strain that also harbors a conditional CRE reporter containing a loxp-flanked stop sequence (LSL) and the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (Eyfp) in the ROSA26 locus (R26-LSL-Eyfp).16 We show that Cebpa-Creâ€“driven Dicer1 deletion did not affect the numbers of myeloid-committed progenitors	 but did play a critical role in the regulation of a developmental program required for normal granulocyte and monocyte/dendritic cell (DC)/macrophages in mice.  Methods  Mice and reconstitution experiments  To generate Cebpa-Cre;R26-LSL-Eyfp;Dicer1wt/fl/Dicer1fl/fl mice	 we crossed mice that contain floxed Dicer1 alleles (Dicer1fl9; a kind gift of Dr P. A. Sharp	 David H. Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research	 Cambridge	 MA) with Cebpa-Cre;R26-LSL-Eyfp reporter mice.2 Fetal livers were obtained on E13.5. Routine genotyping of Dicer1;Cebpa-Cre;R26-LSL-Eyfp mice was performed by PCR assays of DNA from tail or toe biopsies. Sequences of primers are available on request. All primers were obtained from Biolegio. For transplantation	 6- to 8-week-old recipient mice (C57Bl/6; The Jackson Laboratory) were irradiated (8.5 Gy) and tail-vein injected with fetal liver single-cell suspensions. Typically	 cells from each fetal liver were transplanted into 2 recipient mice. Hematopoietic tissues were analyzed 6-10 weeks after transplantation. The percentage chimerism in hematopoietic tissue was detected by flow cytometric analysis of CD45.1 (recipient) and CD45.2 (Dicer1fl/fl and Dicer1fl/wt donor) cells in a total of 8 mice. All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Welfare/Ethics Committee of the Erasmus Medical Center.  Cell culture	 colony assays	 and cytospins  DCs were derived from BM cultures in the presence of GM-CSF as described previously.17 GM-CSFâ€“induced colony formation assays with progenitors from E13.5 fetal livers were performed as described previously.4 Colonies were counted after 7 days of incubation at 37Â°C and 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. For liquid cultures	 E13.5 fetal liver cells were isolated and single-cell suspensions were grown in serum-free CellGro Stem Cell Growth Medium (CellGenix) supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and GM-CSF (10 ng/mL) at a density of 1 Ã— 106 cells/mL for 7 days. For morphologic analysis of the cells	 cytospins were stained with May-GrÃ¼nwald-Giemsa and examined with a Leica DMLB microscope (100Ã— and 40Ã— objectives) and Leica Application Suite Version 2.7.1 R1 software.  Abs	 cell staining	 flow cytometry	 and cell sorting  To obtain BM cell suspensions	 femurs and tibias were crushed in a mortar in PBS with 5% FCS. Cells were passed through a 70-Î¼m nylon sieve and erythrocytes were lysed. Lineage-positive (Lin+) cells were determined with Abs against the following lineage markers: CD3Ïµ	 CD11b	 CD45R/B220	 Ly-6G (Gr-1)	 and Ter119. To recognize HSPC populations	 BM cells were stained with Abs against c-Kit	 Sca-1	 CD34	 and FcÎ³RII/III(CD16/32). Myeloid progenitors were defined as Linâˆ’Sca-1âˆ’c-Kit+CD34+CD16/32low (CMPs)	 Linâˆ’Sca-1lowc-Kit+CD34+CD16/32hi (GMPs)	 and Linâˆ’Sca-1âˆ’c-Kit+CD34âˆ’CD16/32low (megakaryocyte/erythroid progenitor [MEPs]). For the analysis of differentiated EYFP+ myeloid cells in BM	 cells were stained with anti-CD11b and antiâ€“Ly-6G Abs. Peripheral blood obtained by submandibular bleeding was treated with erythrocyte lysis buffer and stained with Abs against CD11b	 Ly-6G	 and Ly-6C for the determination of granulocytes and monocytes. Spleen single-cell suspensions were stained with CD11b and Ly-6G. Macrophages were isolated from the peritoneal cavity with 1.5-mL washes using PBS/5% FCS. For identification of macrophages	 the cell suspensions were stained with Abs against F4/80. To identify the in vitro expansion and differentiation toward DCs	 whole BM cultures were stained with Abs against MHC class II and CD11c. To sort progenitors from BM	 Lin+ cells were depleted before staining with the Mouse Hematopoietic Progenitor (Stem) Cell Enrichment Set (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A forward-side scatter gate excluded cell debris and remaining red blood cells. All sorted populations were more than 95% pure as determined by reanalysis. A full list of Abs used for flow cytometry and suppliers is given in supplemental Table 5 (available on the Blood Web site; see the Supplemental Materials link at the top of the online article).  Gene and miRNA expression profiling  EYFP+ GMPs were sorted into RLT buffer (QIAGEN). RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Micro Kit (QIAGEN). After one step of linear amplification with the RNA MessageAmp II aRNA Kit (Applied Biosystems/AmbionX)	 aRNA was labeled and hybridized on the Mouse Genome 430 Affymetrix 2.0 Array according to standard protocols. Concentrations and purity of RNA samples were determined on a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Isogen Life Science). RNA integrity was confirmed on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with 6000 nano and pico chips. Microarray data were normalized with the Affymetrix Microarray Suite (MAS Version 5.0). All microarray data are available on the Gene Expression Omnibus under accession number GSE35844. To confirm the expression changes in some target genes	 cDNA was produced from 1Î¼g of aRNA using Superscript II (Invitrogen)	 and quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Kit (QIAGEN). Primers were obtained from Biolegio. The Î”Ct value of Dicer1Î”/Î” and Dicer1wt/Î” versus Dicer1 wild-type (Dicer1wt) cells was calculated. The fold induction was calculated by the 2âˆ’Î”Ct method.  miRNAs were isolated using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit and RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit (QIAGEN) according to manufacturer's protocols. For miRNA profiling	 TaqMan Array Rodent MicroRNA A Cards Version 2.0	 which enables quantification of 375 mouse miRNAs and 6 controls	 were used according to the manufacture's protocol for Megaplex Pools With Preamplification (Applied Biosystems) using the ABI PRISM 7900HT machine (Applied Biosystems).  Statistics  TargetScan Version 5.2 (http://www.targetscan.org) was used to identify putative miRNA targets. Profiling of mRNA expression was performed in triplicate for each experimental condition (Dicer1wt	 Dicer1wt/Î”	 or Dicer1Î”/Î”) and subsequently normalized with MAS5.0. Probe sets considered indistinguishable from the background signal were omitted from further analyses. Identification of the differentially expressed probe sets was performed using the false discovery rate (FDR)â€“corrected P values derived by Limma.18 P < .017 was considered statistically significant. We divided the necessary significance level (.05) by the number of pairwise comparisons	 in our case	 3. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to infer differences between cumulative distribution functions	 and P < .05 was considered significant. The Fisher exact test was used to infer enrichment of de-repression for mRNA targets from the identified miRNAs. A FDR-corrected P < .05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed with R Version 2.12 software (http://www.r-project.org).  Results  Cebpa-Creâ€“driven deletion of Dicer1 does not affect the number of HSPCs  In hematopoietic cells	 Cebpa starts to be expressed at the MPP stage and defines a subpopulation that is instructed to develop toward the myeloid lineage	2 making it a suitable promoter to drive Dicer1 deletion for studying the role of miRNAs in myelopoiesis. Whereas the Cebpa-Cre;Dicer1wt/fl mice were viable and born at Mendelian ratios	 the Cebpa-Cre;Dicer1fl/fl mice died rapidly after birth. This phenotype can be largely explained by the fact that the Cebpa promoter is highly active during the maturation of the respiratory epithelium in late gestation19 and deletes Dicer1. Lack of Dicer1 is detrimental to these cells	 similar to Sonic Hedgehog (Shh)â€“Cre conditional Dicer1-knockout mice.20  To investigate whether Dicer1 deletion affects hematopoiesis in the embryo	 we isolated fetal livers at E13.5. Cells containing recombined Dicer1fl alleles (Dicer1Î”) can be identified because they also harbor a conditional CRE reporter R26-LSL-Eyfp allele.16 The E13.5 fetal livers of Dicer1 mutants and wild-type were indistinguishable by eye. In addition	 flow cytometric analysis did not show any differences in the fraction of HSCs	 hematopoietic progenitors	 and lineage-negative (Linâˆ’) EYFP+ progenitors in the fetal livers of Dicer1fl/fl and Dicer1wt/fl mice compared with Dicer1wt controls (Figure 1A). To investigate the effects of Cebpa-Creâ€“driven Dicer1 ablation in hematopoietic cells in adult mice and to bypass early death	 E13.5 fetal liver cells were transplanted in lethally irradiated recipients. With this protocol	 the percentage of chimerism in hematopoietic tissue was at least 92% in the reconstituted mice (data not shown). CRE-dependent deletion of Dicer1fl alleles in EYFP+ cells was confirmed by PCR (Figure 1B). Furthermore	 more than 95% of total miRNAs were depleted in Dicer1Î”/Î”;EYFP+ cells (supplemental Table 1). The expression level of the remaining miRNAs was less than 10% compared with normal EYFP+ control cells (supplemental Table 1)	 indicating that Cebpa-Creâ€“mediated deletion of Dicer1 results in an efficient depletion of miRNAs in myeloid progenitor cells in vivo.

Bottom panel: Percentage of EYFP+ cells in the indicated fractions. Previous studies showed that IFN-responsive promoter-driven Cre (Mx-Cre)â€“induced Dicer1 ablation results in a complete depletion of functional HSCs.14 We wondered to what extent Cebpa-driven Dicer1 deletion affects the number of myeloid-committed progenitor cells. In contrast to the results published previously for HSCs	14 in the present study	 Dicer1 deletion did not affect the percentage of myeloid-committed EYFP+ cells in the LSK fraction significantly (Figure 1C and supplemental Figure 1). In addition	 no significant differences in the fraction of EYFP+ Dicer1Î”/Î” CMPs	 GMPs	 or MEPs compared with those of Dicer1wt/Î”-transplanted mice and Dicer1wt mice were observed (Figure 1C). Therefore	 unlike the effect of Dicer1 deletion on HSC maintenance	14 Cebpa-Creâ€“driven Dicer1 deletion did not affect the numbers of myeloid progenitors in mice.  Cebpa-Creâ€“driven deletion of Dicer1 affects GM-CFU outgrowth	 cellular replating capacity	 and myeloid differentiation  We performed GM-CFU assays to determine whether deletion of Dicer1 would affect the expansion and differentiation capacity of GMPs. The number of GM-CFUs obtained with Dicer1Î”/Î” progenitor cells was approximately 50% lower than with Dicer1wt/Î” or Dicer1wt cells (Figure 2A). Colony size also decreased as a result of Dicer1 deletion (data not shown). Morphologic analyses showed a more than 5-fold increase in the number of blast-like cells	 a strongly reduced capacity of the Dicer1Î”/Î” progenitors to differentiate toward macrophages	 and the appearance of dysplastic neutrophils (Figure 2B). Dicer1Î”/Î” progenitor cells gained the ability to form secondary and tertiary colonies after serial replatings	 which coincided with a regained self-renewal potential	 a blast-like morphology	 and a strongly reduced differentiation capacity of the cells (Figure 2A-B). In GM-CSFâ€“containing liquid cultures	 Linâˆ’;Dicer1Î”/Î” progenitors were unable to mature toward macrophages	 but instead showed features of dysplastic myeloid cells	 including the Pelger-HuÃ«t anomaly	 which is characterized by neutrophils with a hyposegmented nucleus Linâˆ’ Dicer1Î”/Î” BM cells failed to differentiate toward BM-derived DCs (Figure 2D). These results indicate that Dicer1 is essential for definitive maturation of GMPs toward both the neutrophil and monocyte/macrophage/BMâ€“derived DC lineage in vitro.

Significance was calculated by comparing Dicer1Î”/Î” and Dicer1wt/Î” with Dicer1wt controls using the Mann-Whitney test (asymptotic significance [2-tailed]). *P < .05.

Cebpa-Creâ€“driven deletion of Dicer1 causes myeloid dysplasia and monocyte/macrophage depletion in vivo  Next	 we investigated whether the aberrant myeloid differentiation of GMPs observed in vitro also occurs in vivo. Dicer1Î”/Î” BM neutrophils showed increased levels of CD11b (a marker for myeloid cells) and a reduced Ly-6G (a marker for neutrophilic differentiation) expression compared with Dicer1wt/Î” (similar to Dicer1wt; Figure 3A). Whereas Dicer1wt/Î” neutrophils appeared normal	 Dicer1Î”/Î” cells showed aberrant nucleus morphologies (Figure 3B) of which approximately 20% were hyposegmented or bilobed. Furthermore	 Ly-6G+Dicer1Î”/Î” granulocytes were nearly absent in the peripheral blood and spleen (Figure 3C-D	G)	 suggesting that the aberrant neutrophils were incapable of emigrating from the BM.

Concerning monocytic/macrophage development	 whereas Dicer1wt/Î” monocytes appeared in 3 stages of differentiation: high Ly-6C (immature)	 intermediate	 and low Ly-6C (mature)	22 the relative number of mature Dicer1Î”/Î” monocytes was strongly reduced (Figure 3E). Moreover	 we observed a strongly reduced percentage of EYFP+ macrophages in the abdominal cavity of Dicer1Î”/Î”â€“transplanted mice compared with EYFP+;Dicer1wt/Î” controls (Figure 3F). No CD11b+ cells could be detected in the spleen of Dicer1Î”/Î”â€“transplanted mice (Figure 3G). Dicer1Î”/Î” recipients survived for at least 10 months devoid of any sign of myeloproliferative disease or leukemia development.  Twenty miRNA families are active in GMPs and repress expression programs characteristic of HSCs and erythropoiesis  To determine how deletion of Dicer1	 and the resulting loss of miRNA expression	 affects the gene expression landscape of GMPs	 we performed gene-expression analyses of Dicer1 mutant and control GMPs. miRNA-expression profiling of EYFP+ Dicer1wt GMPs identified 104 miRNAs expressed in GMPs (supplemental Table 2). To examine the activities of these miRNAs	 we compared the transcriptome of Dicer1wt	 Dicer1wt/Î”	 and Dicer1Î”/Î” GMPs. Transcripts with predicted binding sites for identified miRNAs tended to be up-regulated in Dicer1-null GMPs compared with transcripts without such sites (P < 2.2 Ã— 10âˆ’16 by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; Figure 4A)	 which is indicative of the activity of the miRNAs in these cells. Transcripts containing putative binding sites for the identified miRNAs had a significant propensity to be up-regulated in the Dicer1Î”/Î” cells (P < 2.2 Ã— 10âˆ’16 by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test)	 but not in the Dicer1wt/Î” cells (Figure 4B). Deletion of Dicer1 in GMPs revealed 784 significant differentially expressed probe sets (FDR-corrected P < .05; Figure 4C). Unsupervised clustering of these probe sets showed that the gene-expression pattern of Dicer1wt/Î” GMPs was changed but still appeared very similar to wild-type GMPs (Figure 4C)	 again indicating that heterozygous deletion of Dicer1 did not strongly affect the miRNA-regulated targets in GMPs.

(A) Cumulative distribution plot of the log fold change of transcripts that contain miRNA-binding sites for the identified miRNAs (supplemental Table 2) and messages that do not contain sites compared with wild-type (P < 2.2 Ã— 10âˆ’16). (B) Cumulative distribution plot of log fold change for mRNA containing miRNA-binding sites for the identified miRNAs (supplemental Table 2) in the indicated populations. The expression ratio of most messages in Dicer1Î”/Î” cells over Dicer1wt/Î” and Dicer1wt are skewed toward higher positive fold changes compared with Dicer1wt/Î” over Dicer1wt (P < 2.2 Ã— 10âˆ’16). (C) Significant differentially expressed genes between GMP wild-type and Dicer1Î”/Î” cells (FDR-corrected P < .05) were unsupervised clustered with GPLOTS (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gplots/index.html). Cebpa-Creâ€“mediated deletion of Dicer1 in GMPs resulted in 300 significantly up-regulated transcripts (368 probe sets	 supplemental Table 3). The up-regulation of some of these genes was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (supplemental Figure 2). A set of transcripts that are experimentally confirmed miRNA targets	 such as Bcl2L11 (Bim)	11 K-Ras and Hmga2	23 Hoxa9	24 and Cdkn1a (p21)	25 also appeared to be regulated by Dicer1 in GMPs (supplemental Table 3). In agreement with data shown in Figure 4B-C	 only 11 transcripts (3%) were very sensitive to Dicer1 deletion	 because Dicer1 heterozygosity had a significant effect on their transcript levels (supplemental Table 3). Predicted targets of 20 miRNA families were significantly enriched in the fraction of messages that were up-regulated in Dicer1Î”/Î” cells compared with the fraction of nonregulated targets (Table 1; FDR-corrected P < .05 by Fisher exact test). Of the 300 genes that were de-repressed by Dicer1 depletion	 81 (> 25%) could be linked to signatures of HSCs	 MPPs	 and early erythropoiesis26 (supplemental Table 4). These findings imply that certain miRNA families control the switch of a cellular program for self-renewal and expansion toward a granulocyte/monocyte/macrophage differentiation program at the GMP stage.  View inlineView popup Table 1 Active miRNA families in GMPs Discussion  The results of the present study show that Cebpa-Creâ€“driven Dicer1 deletion in myeloid-committed progenitors	 and as a result depletion of miRNAs	 disrupts the differentiation program of GMPs that is required for normal myeloid development. This has been demonstrated in 3 ways. First	 normal numbers of Dicer1-null	 EYFP+ myeloid-committed progenitors were detected by flow cytometry	 indicating that depletion of miRNAs was not detrimental for these cells. Second	 gene-expression profiling of Dicer1-null GMPs identified an altered gene expression landscape of GMPs	 including enhanced expression of a set of genes that is characteristic for HSCs	 MPPs	 and early erythropoiesis. These data imply a disordered differentiation program in Dicer1-null GMPs. Finally	 flow cytometric analysis of myeloid cells from different hematopoietic tissues in mice showed a developmental block of monocytes	 strong reduction of mature macrophages in the abdominal cavity	 depletion of myeloid cells in the spleen	 and the presence of dysplastic neutrophils in the BM.  Recently	 Raaijmakers et al reported that deletion of Dicer1 specifically in mouse osteoprogenitors disrupts normal hematopoiesis	 resulting in myelodysplastic syndrome and secondary leukemias in mice.13 In these experiments	 Dicer1 was not deleted in HSPCs or in the myelodysplastic cells	 indicating that the observed dysplasia was initiated by osteoprogenitor dysfunction.13 Complementary to those findings	 we demonstrate herein a myeloid progenitor cellâ€“intrinsic role for miRNA processing in myelopoiesis in a system that leaves the BM environment intact. Our results indicate that Dicer1 may play dual roles in the control of myelopoiesis	 both of which are essential for normal myelopoiesis.  Pelger-HuÃ«t is characterized by abnormal nuclear shape and chromatin organization in blood granulocytes.21 A genome-wide linkage scan identified the lamin B receptor (LBR)	 a member of the sterol reductase family located on the linked genomic region 1q41-43	 to be mutated in patients suffering from Pelger-HuÃ«t disease.27 These mutations result in decreased expression of LBR	 which is strongly correlated with hyposegmentation of the nucleus in neutrophils.27â€“28 In our model	 Dicer1-null neutrophils were hyposegmented	 but LBR expression remained unchanged in Dicer1-null GMPs. This result suggests that other	 as-yet-undefined mechanisms may be involved in the observed developmental abnormalities or that downstream LBR pathways are controlled by Dicer1 and may cause features of Pelger-HuÃ«t anomaly.  In contrast to our results in GMPs	 recently published data show that Dicer1 deletion in hematopoietic cells from different origins causes cell death due to derepression of mRNAs coding for proteins involved in the induction of apoptosis. For example	 Dicer1 ablation in HSCs depletes functional HSCs	 induces rapid apoptosis in HSPCs	 and results in total disruption of hematopoiesis.14 These deleterious effects of miRNA depletion in HSCs can be largely circumvented by the reintroduction of a single miRNA	 miR-125a	 which targets the proapoptotic protein BAK1.14 In addition	 Dicer1 ablation in early B-cell progenitors induces apoptosis at the pre-B cell state because of de-repression of the miR-17-92 proapoptotic target Bcl2L11 (also known as Bim) as the consequence of Dicer1 loss.11 Strikingly	 although Bcl2L11 is approximately 1.8-fold up-regulated in Dicer1-null GMPs (supplemental Table 3)	 this did not induce an increase in apoptosis. In T cells	 Dicer1 is also essential for cell viability	10	12	29 suggesting that Dicer1-dependent RNAs in HSCs and cells from lymphoid origin regulate cell survival	 which agrees with our data in myeloid-committed progenitors. In addition to the regulation of apoptosis	 Dicer1 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of activation	 migration	 lineage choice	 and differentiation of T cells.10	12	29 To our knowledge	 this is the first report describing an exclusive role for Dicer1 in the developmental switch of myeloid-committed progenitors toward mature neutrophils	 macrophages	 and myeloid DCs.  A limitation of the Dicer1-deletion models is the global depletion of miRNAs that presumably results in disruption of many cellular pathways simultaneously	 which hampers the analysis of individual miRNA functions. Our data showed that Cebpa-Creâ€“driven Dicer1 ablation in GMPs depleted 20 active miRNA families simultaneously	 resulting in de-repression of at least 300 potential miRNA targets in GMPs. Because some miRNAs regulate expression by translational inhibition without affecting mRNA stability to a detectable level	 the determined level of miRNA activity is most likely an underestimation. In addition	 transcripts can be regulated by multiple miRNAs	 and the action of miRNAs is dependent on both miRNA and target gene levels	 which complicates the functional analysis of single miRNAs in this model.30 Despite the limitations of our model	 a set of miRNA target genes in GMPs is normally exclusively expressed in HSCs and	 when derepressed due to Dicer1 deletion in GMPs	 might explain	 at least in part	 some of the phenotypic features of the Dicer1-null GMPs. For example	 HOXA9	 a confirmed target of miR-126	24 is up-regulated in Dicer1-null GMPs	 and forced expression in myeloid progenitors blocks differentiation and results in enhanced replating capacity.31 In addition	 the Let-7 target HMGA223 is strongly up-regulated by Dicer1 depletion in GMPs	 and overexpression or truncation of HMGA2 has been found in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.32 In addition	 the robust de-repression of the HSC-specific genes HMGA2 (8-fold) and HOXA9 (3-fold)	 instead of the moderate regulation shown for most miRNA targets	 suggests a miRNA-driven	 switch-like transition from stem cell fate toward differentiation	 as shown for miRNAs lin-4 and let-7 targeting the genes lin-14 and lin-41	 respectively	 in Caenorhabditis elegans.33 Therefore	 our data suggest that the inability to silence stem cell genes in myeloid-committed progenitors interferes with the switch of stemness toward a myeloid differentiation program. Although these findings suggest that some miRNAs function as myeloid progenitors	 an extensive miRNA add-back screen in Dicer1-null cells is needed to identify their specific role in the control of myeloid development	 and this one of the challenges in the field.  In conclusion	 this study has demonstrated that Dicer1 ablation by C/ebpa-Cre does not affect the numbers of HSCs	 CMPs	 and GMPs	 but results in defective GMPs	 which are unable to mature toward monocytes	 macrophages	 and myeloid DCs	 and leads instead to neutrophil dysplasia. We have identified a set of 20 highly active miRNA families in GMPs and provided evidence that Dicer1 controls a gene-expression program that is normally active in HSCs and MPPs and counteracts the expression of messages that are linked to early erythropoiesis. Our data uncover a Dicer1-controlled differentiation program in GMPs that is required for normal myelopoiesis. Constitutional DICER1 mutations were recently reported to cause familial pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB).  Aim To investigate the contribution and phenotypic spectrum of constitutional and somatic DICER1 mutations to cancer.  Methods and results The authors sequenced DICER1 in constitutional DNA from 823 unrelated patients with a variety of tumours and in 781 cancer cell lines. Constitutional DICER1 mutations were identified in 19 families including 11/14 with PPB	 2/3 with cystic nephroma	 4/7 with ovarian Sertoliâ€“Leydig-type tumours	 1/243 with Wilms tumour (this patient also had a Sertoliâ€“Leydig tumour)	 1/1 with intraocular medulloepithelioma (this patient also had PPB)	 1/86 with medulloblastoma/infratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumour	 and 1/172 with germ cell tumour. The inheritance was investigated in 17 families. DICER1 mutations were identified in 25 relatives: 17 were unaffected	 one mother had ovarian Sertoliâ€“Leydig tumour	 one half-sibling had cystic nephroma	 and six relatives had non-toxic thyroid cysts/goitre. Analysis of eight tumours from DICER1 mutation-positive patients showed universal retention of the wild-type allele. DICER1 truncating mutations were identified in 4/781 cancer cell lines; all were in microsatellite unstable lines and therefore unlikely to be driver mutations.  Conclusion Constitutional DICER1 haploinsufficiency predisposes to a broad range of tumours	 making a substantial contribution to PPB	 cystic nephroma and ovarian Sertoliâ€“Leydig tumours	 but a smaller contribution to other tumours. Most mutation carriers are unaffected	 indicating that tumour risk is modest. The authors define the clinical contexts in which DICER1 mutation testing should be considered	 the associated tumour risks	 and the implications for at-risk individuals. They have termed this condition â€˜DICER1 syndromeâ€™.

They considered DICER1 to be a promising candidate and identified pathogenic mutations in 11 families.15 This important finding raises a number of questions. First	 what is the contribution of DICER1 mutations to non-familial	 sporadic PPB? Mutations in some cancer-predisposition genes contribute appreciably to both familial and sporadic forms of disease	 whereas for others the contribution to non-familial cases is small. Second	 do constitutional DICER1 mutations predispose to tumours other than PPB? The International PPB Registry has collected information from over 200 PPB families	 and a variety of different tumours have been reported in PPB cases and/or their relatives 17 18 However	 it is unknown which tumour types are genuinely associated with PPB	 which are related to DICER1 mutations	 and which reflect ascertainment. Third	 do somatic DICER1 mutations contribute to cancer? This is of particular interest as it has been proposed that somatic 14q loss	 which has been reported in many cancers	 may be targeted at DICER1.19â€“21  To address these questions	 we have conducted exhaustive DICER1 sequencing	 in >1600 patient samples	 including constitutional DNAs from 823 individuals with a broad range of tumours	 but particularly focusing on tumours that have been proposed to be associated with PPB (http://www.ppbregistry.org/pdf/Doc_D.pdf) (table 1). We also sequenced DICER1 in DNA from 781 cancer cell lines to assess the impact of somatic DICER1 mutation on cancer development (online supplementary table 1).  VIEW INLINE VIEW POPUP Table 1 Tumours in individuals screened for constitutional DICER1 mutations  Methods  Samples Constitutional DNA was extracted from EDTA venous blood samples and collected through the Factors Associated with Childhood Tumours (FACT) Study	 the Royal Marsden Hospital cancer collections	 and the Institute of Cancer Research UK-wide testicular germ cell tumour collections	 all of which have been approved by an appropriate ethics board. All samples were obtained with full informed consent. The research was undertaken as part of the FACT Study	 which was approved by the London Multicentre Research Ethics Committee (05/MRE02/17). The FACT Study aims to identify genetic factors that predispose to the development of childhood tumours (http://www.icr.ac.uk/fact). The National Registry of Childhood Tumours was used to identify the total number (indicated in parentheses) of cases nationally for PPB (20	 five of whom were deceased)	 cystic nephroma (15	 none deceased) and Sertoliâ€“Leydig cell tumours (seven	 none deceased) that had been registered since its inception in 1962. The clinicians were contacted to request that they recruit these patients to the FACT Study. In addition	 a small minority of patients referred to our clinical genetics service with these tumours were recruited directly. Tumour DNA from DICER1 mutation-positive paraffin-embedded tissues was extracted using QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. We analysed whole-genome amplified DNA from 781 cancer cell lines as part of the Cancer Genome Project	 Cell Line Project (online supplementary table 1).  DICER1 sequencing For analysis of the constitutional DNA	 we designed PCR primers to amplify the 26 coding exons and intronâ€“exon boundaries of DICER1 in a multiplex PCR (online supplementary table 2). Products were sequenced by capillary sequencing using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit and an ABI3730 Genetic Analyser (Applied Biosystems	 Foster City	 California	 USA). Sequences were analysed using Mutation Surveyor software V.3.20 (SoftGenetics). We only included samples in which at least 90% or more of the coding sequence was successfully screened in subsequent analyses. For the cancer cell lines	 PCR primers that amplify 500 bp PCR products encompassing the 26 coding DICER1 exons and intronâ€“exon boundaries were designed and sequenced as described above. Sequence traces were analysed using AutoCSA software	22 followed by manual inspection of putative variants. All putative variants were confirmed by bidirectional sequencing of a second independently amplified PCR product. Matched normal cell lines were available for 40 cell lines. The somatic status of variants identified in these 40 cell lines was determined by sequencing DNA from the corresponding normal. In the remaining cell lines	 we assumed that cell line variants that were also identified in the constitutional DNA screen were not somatic. We evaluated the likely pathogenicity of sequence variants using Polyphen	 SIFT and NNSplice software.  Results  Germline DICER1 mutation analysis We identified pathogenic mutations in 19/823 index individuals (table 2 and online supplementary figure 1). Seventeen mutations led to premature protein truncation as a result of frameshift	 nonsense or consensus splice-site mutations. Two mutations are missense alterations	 for which there is substantial evidence of pathogenicity. First	 they are the only two missense alterations in the 3214 chromosomes screened that are predicted to be pathogenic by SIFT and Polyphen. Second	 both target highly conserved residues in the RNase III domain. Third	 they are in the vicinity of a missense variant identified by Hill et al	 which resulted in a similar DICER1 histochemical profile to truncating mutations.15 We also identified several non-pathogenic variants including nine missense variants	 23 synonymous variants	 and five intronic variants (online supplementary table 3).  VIEW INLINE VIEW POPUP Table 2 Probands and relatives with constitutional DICER1 mutations  Pleuropulmonary blastoma We identified DICER1 mutations in 10 individuals with PPB and in the mother of a child that had died from PPB but from whom no sample was available. One child developed an intraocular medulloepithelioma 4 years after PPB. Three-generational pedigrees were available for most cases	 and no relative had PPB. One sibling died from neuroblastoma; her DICER1 status is not known	 but a mutation was present in her mother. There were three children with PPB	 in whom we did not identify a DICER1 mutation.  Cystic nephroma The most common reported association of PPB is cystic nephroma	17 a rare benign renal tumour that typically presents as a multicystic renal mass without solid nodules. It has a bimodal incidence with 50% occurring in children less than 4 years and 30% in the 5th and 6th decades.23 We had DNA from three unilateral childhood cases	 and in two we identified truncating DICER1 mutations. One of the children had a half-sibling with cystic nephroma who also has the mutation. The child in the second DICER1 mutation-positive case was recently found to have a small lung cyst	 which is being monitored but has not had histological evaluation.  Ovarian Sertoliâ€“Leydig tumours We analysed DNA from 30 individuals with sex cord tumours	 of which six were ovarian Sertoliâ€“Leydig tumours	 which are sex cord tumours that exhibit testicular differentiation.24 The age range of diagnosis is 2â€“75 years	 but âˆ¼75% present in the second or third decades.24 We identified truncating DICER1 mutations in four individuals; three had young-onset bilateral ovarian Sertoliâ€“Leydig tumours	 and one had a unilateral ovarian sex cord tumour that could not be further classified because of necrosis. In one of the bilateral cases	 Wilms tumour was previously present (see below). The mother of one patient had also developed a Sertoliâ€“Leydig tumour at 21 years and carried the DICER1 mutation. She has subsequently had melanoma at 50 years	 endometrial cancer at 62 years	 and breast cancer at 68 years.  Wilms tumour Wilms tumour is an embryonal cancer of the kidney that affects âˆ¼1 in 10â€ˆ000 children	 usually before the age of 6 years.25 26 We analysed DNA from 243 patients with Wilms tumour. We identified one truncating DICER1 mutation	 in a child who developed Wilms tumour of atypical histology at the unusually late age of 8 years. Four years after treatment the child developed bilateral ovarian Sertoliâ€“Leydig cell tumours.  Medulloblastoma/infratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumour (PNET) Medulloblastoma is a PNET that arises in the posterior fossa.27 We analysed 84 childhood medulloblastoma/infratentorial PNET cases and identified one truncating mutation in a child of 13 years. No other information or samples were available.  Seminoma We analysed DNA from 185 individuals with germ cell tumour	 of which 128 had a family history of testicular cancer. We identified one missense DICER1 mutation	 Q1580H. A maternal first cousin once removed of this proband developed testicular cancer at 27 years	 but the proband's mother does not carry the DICER1 mutation. It is not possible to conclusively establish whether this mutation is pathogenic on the available evidence.  Intraocular medulloepithelioma Intraocular medulloepithelioma	 also known as dictyoma	 is a very rare embryonal tumour	 usually originating in the ciliary body of the eye	 which most commonly occurs during childhood.28 One child with PPB also developed a dictyoma and has a DICER1 mutation.  Thyroid non-toxic goitres/cysts In the PPB Registry	 thyroid cancers and thyroid hyperplasia are reported in both probands and relatives of PPB cases. We analysed DNA from 88 patients with thyroid cancer	 but did not identify any mutations. However	 one proband and six relatives of DICER1 mutation-positive individuals developed thyroid cysts/multinodular colloid goitre between the ages of 9 and 30 years. All were non-toxic	 associated with normal thyroid function	 and non-malignant. Thyroidectomy was required in four patients because of recurrent disease.  Other tumours/cysts We did not identify mutations in any of the other tumour types as detailed in table 1.  Family studies in DICER1 mutation-positive individuals We had samples from both parents in 17 families in which a DICER1 mutation had been identified in an index individual. In each	 the mutation had been inherited (table 2). We had grandparental samples for five families. In two families	 the mutation was absent in the respective grandparents	 indicating that the mutation had arisen de novo in the parent. In the other three families	 the mutation was present in a grandparent.  We analysed DNA from 51 relatives	 and we identified 25 relatives with DICER1 mutations. Of these	 as described above	 one mother had a Sertoliâ€“Leydig tumour	 one half-sibling had cystic nephroma	 and six relatives had thyroid cysts/goitre. The remaining 17 individuals did not have clinical features or symptoms likely to be related to the DICER1 mutation	 one relative having muscular dystrophy and another Wegener's granulomatosis.  Analysis of tumours from DICER1 mutation-positive individuals We obtained eight tumours from six DICER1 mutation-positive individuals. This included three PPB	 four Sertoliâ€“Leydig tumours	 and one cystic nephroma. We analysed each tumour for the relevant mutation. Each was heterozygous for the mutationâ€”that is	 the tumour showed a similar mutational profile to that in the blood and there was no loss of the wild-type allele in any tumour.  DICER1 mutation analysis in cancer cell lines We screened 781 cancer cell lines (online supplementary table 1) for DICER1 mutations. These represent an extensive cross-section of cancers	 but do not include many of the cancers in which we identified germline DICER1 mutations. Two hundred and six of the cell lines have previously been shown to have loss of heterozygosity of 14q encompassing DICER1.  We identified four truncating mutations in the 781 cell lines	 and these were in microsatellite unstable lines. We identified 22 non-synonymous variants that were either proven to be somatic or in which normal DNA was not available for evaluation. None were predicted to be deleterious (online supplementary table 4).  Discussion  In 2009	 germline DICER1 mutations were identified in familial PPB	 adding to the list of rare familial cancer syndromes that have yielded critical evidence linking essential biological processes with cancer causation.15 In this study	 we have expanded knowledge of the link between DICER1 and cancer. First	 we demonstrate that germline DICER1 mutations are the major cause of PPB. In the UK	 20 cases of PPB have been registered in the National Registry of Childhood Tumours over the last 35 years. We were able to include 14 in this study	 none of which had a family history of PPB. We identified DICER1 mutations in 11 of these cases. This represents one of the largest known contributions of germline mutations of a single gene to a specific tumour type. It is uncertain whether cryptic DICER1 mutations account for any of the negative cases	 whether mutations in another gene can also cause PPB	 or whether the remaining cases are not due to germline predisposition genes. However	 it is clear that germline DICER1 mutations are the major cause of both familial and non-familial PPB.  We have also demonstrated that DICER1 mutations cause a range of phenotypes; not all families include PPB	 and a high proportion of mutation carriers are clinically well. In view of this	 we suggest that â€˜DICER1 syndromeâ€™ is a preferable term to â€˜PPB familial tumour syndromeâ€™	 which has previously sometimes been used. The range of different tumours that can occur in individuals with DICER1 mutations is broad	 and it is likely that more associated tumours will be identified as further mutation testing is undertaken. The contribution of DICER1 mutations to different tumours is very variable. The major tumours that occur in DICER1 syndrome appear to be PPB	 cystic nephroma and ovarian Sertoliâ€“Leydig tumour. Evidence for this comes from our mutational data	 our clinical and mutational investigation of relatives of mutation-positive probands	 and from the spectrum of tumours that have been documented in relatives of PPB cases in the PPB Registry.17 18 The contribution of DICER1 mutations to different tumours is also very variable. Although germline DICER1 mutations may contribute significantly to cystic nephroma	 ovarian Sertoliâ€“Leydig tumour and intraocular medulloepithelioma	 they are unlikely to have a major impact on the incidence of Wilms tumour	 medulloblastoma/infratentorial PNET or neuroblastoma.  In addition to tumours	 DICER1 mutations also appear to confer a risk of thyroid cysts. One proband and six DICER1 mutation-positive relatives developed thyroid cysts in childhood or young adulthood. Although histology results were only available for two cases	 both were non-toxic multinodular colloid goitres. This is of particular interest	 as the gene for familial non-toxic multinodular thyroid goitre has been previously shown to localise to 14q.29  The mutation analyses in cancer cell lines suggest that somatic DICER1 mutations do not make a substantial contribution to cancer. This is in contrast with recent reports hypothesising that the 14q hemizygosity observed in 206/761 cell lines is targeted at DICER1.19â€“21 In the great majority of the cell lines	 the 14q loss of heterozygosity extends over a very large area and includes many genes. If loss of DICER1 were the main driver	 one would expect that somatic DICER1 mutations would occur in at least some of the cell lines with normal 14q chromosomes. However	 we only identified four truncating mutations	 and these were in microsatellite unstable lines and therefore unlikely to be driver mutations. Thus the somatic mutational profile of DICER1 appears to differ from that of other ubiquitously expressed	 critically important genes	 such as TP53 and RB1	 which also predispose to rare childhood cancers when mutated in the germline.  The mechanism of DICER1 tumour predisposition also appears to differ from the majority of known cancer-predisposition genes and is likely to operate by a haploinsufficiency mechanism (figure 1). Our analysis of tumours showed no loss of the wild-type allele	 and Hill et al showed retained DICER1 expression in tumour cells.15 Data from mice studies are also consistent with a haploinsufficiency model and indicate that	 whereas monoallelic DICER1 inactivation promotes tumorigenesis	 biallelic loss is inhibitory.20 21 Our data further suggest that	 although inactivation of one DICER1 allele is the initiating event in DICER1 syndrome	 presumably because it leads to dysregulation of miRNA levels	 other events must be required for cancer to occur. It is not known what these additional events are	 or how many are required for oncogenesis to proceed. However	 the low frequency of tumours in DICER1 mutation carriers suggests that either more than one additional event is required and/or the likelihood of the event(s) occurring is small.  Figure 1 Download figure Open in new tab Download powerpoint Figure 1 Different mechanisms of cancer predisposition resulting from germline mutations in tumour suppressor genes. (A) The classic two-hit mechanism	 exemplified by retinoblastoma	 involves a germline/constitutional mutation which constitutes the first hit and is present in every cell. A second mutation (hit) targeting the wild-type allele in a retinoblast has to occur for oncogenesis to proceed. (B) Haploinsufficiency mechanism	 exemplified by DICER1 syndrome. A germline/constitutional mutation predisposes to tumours. One or more additional events are required for oncogenesis to proceed	 but does not appear to include inactivation of the wild-type DICER1 allele. mut	 mutant; wt	 wild-type.  Our data demonstrate that the risk of tumours in DICER1 mutation carriers is low	 and most mutation carriers do not develop tumours. This modest penetrance and the variable phenotype of DICER1 syndrome raise significant clinical challenges. We suggest that diagnostic DICER1 testing should be considered in individuals with possible PPB	 cystic nephroma	 ovarian Sertoliâ€“Leydig tumour or medulloepithelioma. The prevalence of mutations in these conditions may be considerable	 and identification of a DICER1 mutation can aid diagnosis and management	 particularly for PPB	 which can show significant clinical overlap with other types of lung cyst.18 30  The issue of surveillance in a pleiotropic condition of modest penetrance is also complex. To date	 ad hoc	 variable screening for PPB has been undertaken in individual families	 often using lung CT	 which can require an anaesthetic	 involves radiation exposure	 and is of unproven efficacy.31 Moreover	 the natural history and appropriate management of such screen-detected lesions in a well child is unknown. In view of these considerations and the modest penetrance	 we are currently operating an â€˜open-doorâ€™ management policy with early investigation of potential tumour-related symptoms	 but we are not undertaking routine surveillance in healthy mutation-positive individuals. This policy will be under continuous review	 particularly over the next few years	 when extensive expert discussions about the optimal management of DICER1 mutation carriers are likely to occur.  In this study	 we clarify the phenotypes associated with constitutional DICER1 mutations and propose that the condition should be called â€˜DICER1 syndromeâ€™. In the future	 additional research will hopefully further clarify the clinical features	 tumour risks	 and optimal management of this condition and will illuminate the mechanisms by which DICER1 haploinsufficiency predisposes to human disease.  																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			
4	42||Sex cordâ€“stromal tumors and germ-cell tumors account for less than 10% of ovarian cancers.1 Unlike epithelial ovarian cancers	 both sex cordâ€“stromal tumors and germ-cell tumors can also occur in the testicle; testicular germ-cell tumors are the most common cancer in boys and men of European descent between the ages of 15 and 34 years.2	3 Other than a pathognomonic somatic mutation in FOXL2 in adult granulosa-cell tumors	4-6 little is known about the pathogenesis of ovarian sex cordâ€“stromal tumors and germ-cell tumors. Recently	 germline mutations in the microRNA processing gene DICER1 have been reported in probands with pleuropulmonary blastoma or the related familial tumor dysplasia syndrome	 known as pleuropulmonary blastomaâ€“family tumor and dysplasia syndrome (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man [OMIM] number	 601200)	 which includes cystic nephroma	 ovarian sex cordâ€“stromal tumor (especially Sertoliâ€“Leydig cell tumor)	 and multinodular goiter.7 MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a functional class of noncoding RNA molecules that regulate translation and degradation of messenger RNA.8	9 MiRNA transcripts are processed from hairpin pre-miRNA precursors into short miRNA:miRNA* duplexes consisting of the miRNA targeting strand and the imperfectly complementary miRNA* strand (star strand	 or inert carrier strand) by Dicer	 an endoribonuclease with two RNase IIIâ€“like domains. The RNase IIIb domain cuts the miRNA strand	 whereas the RNase IIIa domain cleaves the miRNA* strand.10	11 The resultant RNA duplex is loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) containing an Argonaute protein. The miRNA* strand is then removed	 leaving the miRNA strand	 which targets messenger RNAs for degradation or interacts with the translation initiation complex to inhibit and destabilize translation of the targeted messenger RNAs.12	13 The expression levels of Dicer have global effects on the biogenesis of miRNA	 and reduced expression correlates with a poor outcome in many cancers.7	14-18 In mouse models of cancer	 the loss of a single Dicer1 allele (haploinsufficiency) reduced the time to tumor onset19 or survival time	20 as compared with control animals. Experimental data support the hypothesis that the pathogenicity of aberrations in Dicer function is dependent on the cellular context and that the activation or inhibition of pathways for tissue-specific development and differentiation are at least partially controlled by specific miRNAs or miRNA families.7	8	21 In mouse models with urogenital-specific knockout of Dicer1	 there is evidence of apoptosis of germ cells and Sertoli cells22-24 but no induction of a tumorigenic phenotype. Outside the urogenital tract	 impaired differentiation occurs with Dicer loss25-27 but requires a further challenge for oncogenesis.19	20 In this study	 we report recurrent somatic missense mutations of DICER1 that implicate a defect in miRNA processing	 not as a permissive event in tumor onset (as might be expected for loss of function in a tumor suppressor) but rather as an oncogenic event in the specific context of nonepithelial ovarian tumors. METHODS Experimental Data The methodologic details of all experiments that we conducted are provided in the Supplementary Appendix	 available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. Tumor Samples The 14 discovery samples included juvenile-type granulosa-cell tumors	 primitive germ-cell tumors of the yolk-sac type	 and Sertoliâ€“Leydig cell tumors from the Children's Oncology Group at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus	 Ohio	 and the Ovarian Cancer Research Program (OvCaRe) tissue bank in Vancouver	 British Columbia	 Canada. Both resources provide access to samples through specific application to studies approved by institutional review boards	 including next-generation sequencing studies. We used 411 additional tumor samples for validation. Transcriptome	 Exome	 and Sanger Sequencing We carried out transcriptome sequencing and analysis as described previously.4	28	29 We performed exome capture of genomic coding regions through solution hybrid selection.30 Raw data were deposited at the European Genomeâ€“Phenome Archive (accession number	 EGAS00001000135). We performed Sanger sequencing in the region of DICER1 encoding the RNase IIIb domain in DNA from samples in both the discovery and validation series and in germline DNA	 when available. DICER1 Enzyme Assay We incubated wild-type DICER1 protein	 mutants	 and controls with 5â€²-32phosphate (32P)â€“labeled RNA oligonucleotide substrates and analyzed the cleavage products by means of gel electrophoresis and phosphorimaging. RESULTS Somatic Mutations in DICER1 Using a combination of whole-transcriptome and whole-exome sequencing	 we looked for genomic aberrations in two Sertoliâ€“Leydig cell tumors	 four juvenile granulosa-cell tumors	 and eight primitive germ-cell tumors of the yolk-sac type (Tables 1 and 2 in the Supplementary Appendix). We discovered four nonsynonymous missense mutations in DICER1 affecting the D1709 residue	 one nonsense truncating mutation	 and one insertion mutation that was predicted to result in a frameshift and truncation (Figure 1FIGURE 1 Mutations in DICER1.). All mutations were validated by means of Sanger sequencing. The D1709 residue is within a cluster of acidic residues that are responsible for metal binding10	11 in the catalytic center of the RNase IIIb domain (Fig. 1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Despite adequate sequence coverage	 we observed no mutations that were predicted to affect the RNase IIIa domain (Fig. 2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Sequence-read data (Table 1 in the Supplementary Appendix) and Sanger traces from mutant DICER1 samples confirmed that all mutations were heterozygous. Copy-number analysis confirmed that only a single sample	 PGCTYS-05 with wild-type DICER1	 showed heterozygous loss around DICER1 (Fig. 3 in the Supplementary Appendix). DICER1 Mutations in the Validation Set The recurrent D1709 mutations in our discovery set seemed likely to have an effect on cleavage of miRNAs and metal (Mg2+/Mn2+) binding and are thus potentially pathogenic.10	11 We performed Sanger sequencing encompassing the regions encoding all four metal-binding residues within the RNase IIIb domain in a validation set that included 101 additional nonepithelial ovarian tumors (Table 1TABLE 1 Prevalence of Somatic Hot-Spot Mutations Affecting the RNase IIIb Domain of DICER1 in Nonepithelial Ovarian Tumors.	 and Tables 3	4	 and 5 in the Supplementary Appendix). We also screened 39 testicular tumors to determine whether they harbored the same mutations. Among the nonepithelial ovarian tumor types that were screened	 mutations affecting any one metal-binding residue were present	 with the highest prevalence in Sertoliâ€“Leydig cell tumors: 26 of 43 (60%) of these tumors harbored a mutation. We designated these mutations affecting RNase IIIb metal-binding residues as hot spots. Apart from ovarian sex cordâ€“stromal tumors and germ-cell tumors	 1 of 14 single	 developmentally related	 nonseminomatous testicular germ-cell tumors harbored a D1709N mutation (Table 3 in the Supplementary Appendix). To determine whether these mutations occur in other cancers with a so-called primitive phenotype	 we analyzed 5 embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas; 2 of these tumors had hot-spot mutations	 1 of which occurred in a patient with a previously described germline mutation.31 We found hot-spot mutations in 33 of 159 tumors in the discovery and validation sets combined	 including ovarian	 testicular	 and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma tumor types. Among these mutations	 the most prevalent were the 17 mutations affecting D1709. We confirmed that mutations were somatic in 16 cases for which we had corresponding germline DNA. We attempted to assess all hot-spot regions by performing Sanger sequencing of two independent amplicons spanning the metal-binding residues (for details	 see the Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix). However	 because of poor preservation of DNA in formalin-fixed	 paraffin-embedded material	 in some instances we could sequence only a single amplicon (4 mutation-positive samples and 18 mutation-negative samples) (Table 3 in the Supplementary Appendix). In cases in which both amplicon regions were successfully sequenced	 mutations affecting any one RNase IIIb metal-binding residue were mutually exclusive with mutations affecting any other IIIb metal-binding residue (P<0.01 by Fisher's exact tests) (Fig. 4 in the Supplementary Appendix). We observed no mutations affecting the metal-binding regions of the RNase IIIa domain	 despite targeted sequencing of 4 samples that were positive for an RNase IIIb mutation and 9 samples that were mutation-negative. Immunohistochemical analysis did not provide a proxy for hot-spot mutation status	 since all tumors were positive for DICER1 expression (Fig. 5 in the Supplementary Appendix). The DICER1 hot-spot mutations are not present in the 1000 Genomes Project data or the public-data repository of the Cancer Genome Atlas consortium. No recurrent DICER1 mutations have been reported in the mutation database of the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC)	 in which 4 of 938 cancers have somatic mutations but none in the RNase IIIb hot spots or RNase IIIa equivalents.32 Moreover	 these mutations were not observed in any of the more than 1000 cancer-sequencing libraries that we studied or in 15 adult granulosa-cell tumors with FOXL2 mutations from our validation cohort. On the basis of reported DICER1 dysfunction in epithelial ovarian cancers	14 we further analyzed a series of 266 epithelial ovarian and endometrial cancers and observed a somatic hot-spot mutation (c.5676Gâ†’A	 encoding an E1813G substitution) in a single ovarian carcinosarcoma (Table 4 in the Supplementary Appendix). Compound DICER1 Mutations Across our discovery and validation series	 seven samples had a hot-spot mutation and an additional germline or somatic DICER1 mutation (Table 2TABLE 2 Patients with a Hot-Spot Mutation and an Additional Germline or Somatic DICER1 Mutation.	 and Table 3 in the Supplementary Appendix). To show that the specific hot-spot DICER1 somatic mutation was a separate hit on a different allele from the germline mutation	 we cloned and sequenced complementary DNA (cDNA) from sample SLCT-19	 which had a germline DICER1 deletion (5018-5021delTCAA). The primers for the reverse-transcriptaseâ€“polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay were chosen to allow capture of both the germline and somatic changes in a single amplicon	 should the two changes exist in cis with one another (Figure 2FIGURE 2 Germline Mutations of DICER1 in Trans with Somatic Hot-Spot Mutations.). Only the allele with the hot-spot mutation was observed	 a finding consistent with a lymphoblastoid cell line derived from the same person in which transcripts containing the germline variant have been shown to undergo nonsense-mediated decay of messenger RNA.33 Using this RT-PCR strategy	 we further showed that hot-spot mutations in three other samples were in trans with a separate DICER1 mutation	 and expression of the allele with the hot-spot mutation was predominant (Table 2	 and Fig. 6 in the Supplementary Appendix). Although it is possible that mutation of the nonâ€“hot-spot allele was present in other tumors from this study	 because of the generally poor quality of DNA from formalin-fixed	 paraffin-embedded samples	 screening of the entire DICER1 sequence was not performed. Functional Characterization of DICER1 Mutants We carried out RNA cleavage assays to compare the activity of DICER1 proteins containing the hot-spot D1709N	 D1709E	 and E1705K substitutions with that of wild-type and control samples	 including a D1709A mutant with greatly reduced RNase IIIb activity that shows total loss of DICER1 function only if a substitution in the RNase IIIa domain is also present10	11 (Figure 3FIGURE 3 Functional Characterization of DICER1 Mutations In Vitro.). Wild-type DICER1 (including ectopic	 endogenous	 and commercially obtained forms) generated products of 18 and 22 nucleotides (Figure 3B	 and Fig. 7 in the Supplementary Appendix). These products correspond to those of enzymatic cleavage that produce a mature miRNA duplex (Figure 3A)	 whereas the D1709A enzyme generated only the 18-nucleotide product	 as expected.10	11 This finding indicates that the 22-nucleotide band is derived from activity at the RNase IIIb site	 whereas the 18-nucleotide band is related to activity at the RNase IIIa site. The hot-spot mutant DICER1 proteins yielded markedly low levels of the 22-nucleotide product and substantial levels of the 18-nucleotide product	 suggesting that	 like the D1709A mutation	 the D1709N	 D1709E	 and E1705K substitutions result in reduced RNase IIIb activity but retention of RNase IIIa activity. Preliminary analysis of miRNA expression in four Sertoliâ€“Leydig cell tumors with DICER1 hot-spot mutations had similar overall mature or processed miRNA expression levels as a Sertoliâ€“Leydig cell tumor with no mutation in DICER1 (Fig. 8 in the Supplementary Appendix). Three of these Sertoliâ€“Leydig cell tumors had second-allele nonâ€“hot-spot mutations	 two of which were known to be truncating (Table 2). Thus	 miRNA processing in the latter two Sertoliâ€“Leydig cell tumors probably occurs through the hot-spot mutant DICER1	 in which case tumors with mutant and nonmutant versions of DICER1 have similar levels of miRNA-processing activity. DISCUSSION The hot-spot DICER1 mutations that we report here are predominantly restricted to a specific subset of nonepithelial ovarian tumors and are highly prevalent (60%) in Sertoliâ€“Leydig cell tumors. We also observed hot-spot mutations in a single high-grade ovarian carcinosarcoma	 one testicular germ-cell tumor	 and two embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas. The presence of these recurrent mutations in tumors that have an embryonal or primitive appearance suggests that their pathogenicity may be restricted to specific cell types or developmental settings. Generally	 though	 somatic mutations in DICER1 in patients with cancer are rare. A survey of cancer cell lines showed that 4 of 781 had truncating changes in DICER1.34 It is not clear whether these mutations were germline or somatic	 but all occurred in microsatellite-unstable lines	 suggesting limited relevance to carcinogenesis. Somatic mutations in DICER1 (albeit not the hot-spot mutations described here) have been reported in a single patient with prostate cancer35 and in two patients with epithelial ovarian cancers.14 Germline truncating DICER1 mutations have been reported in children with pleuropulmonary blastoma or a family history of the disease and related disorders	 including families with Sertoliâ€“Leydig cell tumors7 or ovarian sex cordâ€“stromal tumors with or without a history of pleuropulmonary blastoma.36 Among 823 patients with a variety of primitive tumors	 there was a low prevalence of germline DICER1 mutations that are likely to cause loss of function.34 None of these germline mutations involved the hot-spot locations that we report here or appeared to cluster within narrow regions. Retention of the wild-type DICER1 allele has been reported in the context of these germline loss-of-function mutations in all cases in which loss-of-heterozygosity studies were performed.7 It is possible that undetected hot-spot mutations were present on the ostensibly wild-type allele in these tumors. The recurrent and focal nature of the mutations and their restriction to nonepithelial ovarian tumors suggest a common oncogenic mechanism associated with a specific altered DICER1 function that is selected during tumor development in these cell types. This hypothesis is supported by several other observations. First	 the in vitro biochemical data support impaired RNase IIIb activity and retention of RNase IIIa activity in tumors with hot-spot mutations. The fact that the RNase IIIa domain appears to be unaffected by mutations in the tumors that have been screened so far suggests that biologic activity in tumors with hot-spot mutations could be associated with the retained activity of the RNase IIIa site or the RISC loading function of DICER1. Second	 DICER1 protein with hot-spot mutations appears to be capable of miRNA processing. We observed a second mutation in seven tumors with hot-spot mutations	 and in six of these samples	 the nonâ€“hot-spot mutated allele was predicted to be null. Thus	 any DICER1-associated miRNA biogenesis in these six tumors was probably due to the activity of DICER1 with a hot-spot mutation. Although a global reduction in miRNA expression is one potential effect of the hot-spot mutation	 our analysis suggests that a total loss of miRNA biogenesis is highly unlikely. Finally	 DICER1 expression in tumors with hot-spot mutations argues against a role for DICER1 as a classic two-hit tumor suppressor. The localized and focal pattern of mutation is typical of dominantly acting oncogenes	 like KRAS and BRAF. The absence of loss of heterozygosity that is seen in association with germline DICER1 mutations provides further evidence against a role for DICER1 as either a haploinsufficient or a two-hit recessive tumor suppressor. Our findings suggest that DICER1 alleles with hot-spot mutations produce viable protein. The hot-spot mutations appear to represent a new class in which the loss of the wild-type allele may occur in tandem with the retention of a hot-spot mutant DICER1 protein. We hypothesize that an oncogenic miRNA profile is derived from altered DICER1 activity in the RNase IIIb domain. Furthermore	 such activity may result in a positive bias toward the processing or selection of the RNase IIIaâ€“processed strand of the miRNA duplex (the miRNA* strand)	 which is consistent with the finding that the ability of DICER1 to load miRNA into RISC does not depend on the integrity of its RNase III domains.37 Recent studies suggest that miRNA* species may be important in gene regulation rather than simply being an inert strand.38	39 This hypothesis is consistent with the known importance of specific miRNAs in cell differentiation and cell-fate determination	 although the mechanisms by which RNase IIIb hot-spot mutations affect miRNA processing or RISC loading in the context of cancer development warrants further investigation. We conclude that in a range of nonepithelial ovarian cancers	 and potentially other cancers	 aberrant miRNA processing resulting from DICER1 hot-spot mutations is a key oncogenic event.  																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										
1	43||Mesenchymal cell populations contribute to microenvironments regulating stem cells and the growth of malignant cells. Osteolineage cells participate in the hematopoietic stem cell niche. Here	 we report that deletion of the miRNA processing endonuclease Dicer1 selectively in mesenchymal osteoprogenitors induces markedly disordered hematopoiesis. Hematopoietic changes affected multiple lineages recapitulating key features of human myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) including the development of acute myelogenous leukemia. These changes were microenvironment dependent and induced by specific cells in the osteolineage. Dicer1âˆ’/âˆ’ osteoprogenitors expressed reduced levels of Sbds	 the gene mutated in the human bone marrow failure and leukemia predisposition Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond Syndrome. Deletion of Sbds in osteoprogenitors largely phenocopied Dicer1 deletion. These data demonstrate that differentiation stage-specific perturbations in osteolineage cells can induce complex hematological disorders and indicate the central role individual cellular elements of â€˜estromaâ€™ can play in tissue homeostasis. They reveal that primary changes in the hematopoietic microenvironment can initiate secondary neoplastic disease.  Mesenchymal cells are a part of virtually every tissue in metazoans and are thought to participate in organ formation	 cellular composition	 patterning and size. In adult tissues	 these cells are considered â€˜stromaâ€™ without clear function. Identification of somatic stem cell populations has made possible the study of heterologous cells comprising their niche. Mesenchymal cells of osteolineage have been shown to regulate hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) 1	2 with osterix expressing skeletal progenitors initiating ectopic HSC niche formation3. We previously examined mesenchymal-HSC interactions using mice engineered to express individual genes in osteoblastic cells1	4 and now sought to define more precisely the stage of osteolineage differentiation critical for hematopoiesis using promoters more restricted in their expression to alter candidate genes. We chose to alter a gene that could modulate a landscape of other gene products.  Dicer1 is a RNase III endonuclease essential for miRNA biogenesis5 and RNA processing6. MiRNAs regulate hematopoietic cell fate 7 and global down-regulation of miRNAs by Dicer1 deletion promotes tumorigenesis in a cancer-cell-autonomous manner8. We used Dicer1 deletion as a means of altering multiple gene products in subsets of mesenchymal osteolineage cells. We intercrossed mice expressing GFP-Cre recombinase under the transcriptional control of the osterix9 promoter expressed in osteoprogenitor cells to mice with floxed Dicer1 alleles10 generating Osx-GFP-Cre+: Dicerfl/+ (OCDfl/+control) and Osx-GFP-Cre+ Dicerfl/fl (OCDfl/fl mutant) mice. The Cre transgene in this model is expressed coordinately with endogenous Osterix11 (figure 1a). Mutant mice were born at Mendelian frequency	 but displayed growth retardation and impaired survival (~30% mutant mortality by 8 weeks). Therefore	 we examined mice at age 4â€“6 weeks.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Impaired osteoblastic differentiation in OCD fl/fl mice Impaired osteoblastic differentiation  Dicer1 gene deletion in bone was shown by genomic PCR (figure 1b) and its efficiency confirmed by qPCR of Dicer1 mRNA in primary GFP+ (CD45âˆ’lineageâˆ’CD31âˆ’) cells (figure 1c	d and supplementary figure 1a	b). Dicer1 was not deleted in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (figure 1e) nor expressed in other hematopoietic subpopulations (not shown). Bone marrow stromal osteogenic colony number was decreased relative to total colony forming number (CFU-ALK/CFU-F)	 indicative of reduced osteogenic differentiation (figure 1f	g). OCD fl/fl bone marrow stromal cultures also demonstrated decreased alkaline phosphatase and calcified matrix deposition upon osteogenic differentiation (supplementary figure 1d). In vivo	 osteoblasts from OCDfl/fl mice expressed less of the terminal differentiation marker osteocalcin (figure 1h and supplementary figure 1e). Altered texture of the mineralized bone matrix was observed (supplementary figure 1f)	 but not reduction in trabecular or cortical bone volume (supplementary figure 1g	h). Osteoblast number was modestly	 although significantly decreased	 whereas osteoclast number and function was not affected (supplementary figure 1iâ€“k and not shown). Taken together	 the data show that Dicer1 deletion in osteoprogenitors impairs osteoblastic differentiation both in vitro and in vivo.  Myelodysplasia in OCDfl/fl mice  Leukopenia with reduced numbers of cells in all leukocyte subsets was found in OCDfl/fl mice (figure 2a and supplementary figure 2a). Erythrocyte and platelet counts varied widely in OCDfl/fl mice with some animals showing profound anemia and thrombocytopenia (figure 2a). The variability was at least partly explained by extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen (supplementary figure 3) mitigating cytopenia in those animals. The bone marrow of OCDfl/fl mice was normo- to hypercellular (supplementary figure 2c	d). No significant differences were found in the frequency of immunophenotypically defined hematopoietic stem (Lineageâˆ’ckit+Sca1+(LKS)CD150+CD48âˆ’) and progenitor (LKS) cells (supplementary figures 2d	e and 4). Limiting dilution transplant analysis revealed an increase in HSCs in mutants which did not reach statistical significance (1:29000 vs. 1:52000	 p=0.14). HSC and progenitor function was not impaired in OCDfl/fl mice as demonstrated by competitive reconstitution capacity upon transplantation or colony-forming unit (CFU-C) analysis (supplementary figure 2f	g). Decreased blood cell counts despite normal bone marrow cellularity and normal to increased stem cell function is characteristic of ineffective hematopoiesis.  Figure 2 Figure 2 Myelodysplasia in OCD fl/fl mice Morphologic assessment revealed marked dysplasia with nuclear hypersegmentation in neutrophils and giant platelets in the blood and micromegakaryocytes with hypolobulated	 hyperchromatic nuclei in the bone marrow of OCDfl/fl mice (figure 2b	c and supplementary figure 5aâ€“c) There was neither increased fibrosis on reticulin staining nor ring sideroblasts on iron stains of the bone marrow (not shown). Peripheral cytopenia with dysgranulopoiesis and dysplastic megakaryocytes is consistent with a diagnosis of MDS in mice according to the Bethesda criteria12. The aetiology of human MDS is complex and poorly understood. It has been very difficult to engraft and propagate the hematopoietic characteristics of human MDS in murine models by transplanting hematopoietic cells from MDS patients into immunodeficient mice	 sparking a longstanding debate about a potential causative or facilitating role of the microenvironment in the pathogenesis of this disease.  Examining other key characteristics of the human disease	 we observed increased apoptosis and proliferation of primitive hematopoietic progenitors (figure 2d	e and supplementary figures 6	 7 and 8a)13. Increased apoptosis was limited to primitive progenitor cells	 as no differences were observed in differentiated (lineage +) cells (not shown). Within Lineage-ckit+ cells	 apoptosis was most pronounced in megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEP) (supplementary figure 7). HSC generally are more quiescent in close proximity to the endosteal surface in vivo.14. When we imaged transplanted wild-type cells	 we noted that LKS cells located significantly closer to the endosteum in mutant animals compared with controls (supplementary figure 8b	c) and the frequency of cell duplets	 an indicator of cell proliferation	 was strikingly increased (supplementary figure 8d)	 demonstrating increased proliferation of primitive progenitors despite close proximity to the endosteal surface.  OCDfl/fl mice also had reduced B-cells and B-cell progenitors with a concomitant increased frequency of myeloid cells in the bone marrow (supplementary figures 2h	i and 9) as observed in human MDS15	16. The nature of the B-cell defect in early MDS has remained elusive since cytogenetic studies have failed to link B-cells to the malignant clone in MDS. Interestingly	 osteoblasts have recently been shown to constitute a niche for B-cell lymphopoiesis17	18. OCDfl/fl mice also displayed variable	 but increased vascularity in the bone marrow	 a feature that has been described in MDS19 (supplementary figure 2j). Deficiency of either vitamin B12 or folate which can cause myelodysplastic features13	 were excluded as contributing factors in the OCD fl/fl mice (not shown).  Myelodysplasia is environmentally induced  Next	 we used transplantation to assess the contribution of the microenvironment to the hematopoietic phenotype. Hematopoietic cells of OCDfl/fl (CD45.2) mice demonstrating profound cytopenia and myelodysplastic features were transplanted into (CD45.1) B6.SJL mice (â€œwild-type environmentâ€) (figure 3a). Transplanted animals were without apparent signs of disease. Assessment of peripheral blood and bone marrow 16 weeks (figure 3aâ€“d and supplementary figure 10) or 12 months (supplementary figure 11) after transplant showed nearly complete donor (CD45.2) chimerism with complete normalization of cytopenias	 granulocyte and megakaryocyte morphology	 intramedullary apoptosis of primitive progenitors and bone marrow vascularity. The results indicate that the hematopoietic phenotype cannot be propagated in a hematopoietic cell-autonomous matter. Conversely	 when bone marrow cells from wild-type B6.SJL mice were transplanted into lethally irradiated mutant or control mice (figure 3eâ€“h and supplementary figure 12)	 mutant recipients developed leukopenia	 anemia and thrombocytopenia	 dysplastic features of CD45.1 blood cells	 increased bone marrow vascularity with dysplastic megakaryocytes	 increased frequency of myeloid cells	 decreased frequency of B-cell subsets and increased apoptosis of primitive hematopoietic progenitors. The combined experiments provide formal proof that the myelodysplastic phenotype observed in mutant mice is determined by the micro-environment.  Figure 3 Figure 3 Myelodysplasia in OCD fl/fl mice is induced by the bone marrow microenvironment Osteolineage stage specificity  To examine whether mesenchymal cells of the osteoblastic lineage can directly induce aberrant hematopoiesis	 we established bone marrow derived stromal cell cultures from OCDfl/+ vs. OCDfl/fl mice and co-cultured these with red-fluorescent (DS-red) hematopoietic LKS and MEP cells (supplementary figure 13). Stromal cells were osteolineage committed as evidenced by Osterix expression (and deletion of Dicer1; not shown) but lacked terminally differentiated osteoblasts as indicated by the absence of osteocalcin expression (supplementary figure 13a). Co-cultures on osterix+ osteocalcinâˆ’OCDfl/fl stromal cells revealed increased proliferation of LKS cells (supplementary figure 13 bâ€“d) and impaired megakaryocyte differentiation of MEP cells (supplementary figure 13 eâ€“h). The latter was accompanied by morphological changes in megakaryocytic cells (supplementary figure 13i)	 resembling those observed in vivo. Together	 the data show that the disruption of hematopoiesis observed in OCDfl/fl mice in vivo is	 at least partly	 the result of a direct effect of osterix+osteocalcinâˆ’ osteolineage cells on hematopoietic cell proliferation and differentiaton. To further explore whether osteoprogenitor cells rather than terminally differentiated (osteocalcin+) osteoblasts were the key participants in the hematopoietic abnormality	 we crossed Dicerfl/fl with mice in which cre recombinase was driven by the osteocalcin promoter. Efficient recombination by the osteocalcin-cre as previously demonstrated20 was confirmed (supplementary figure 14a) and serial dilution of DNA isolated from long bones demonstrated equivalent efficacy of Dicer1 deletion using either the osteocalcin or osterix driven cre (not shown). Dicer1 deletion in this genetic context recapitulated some aspects of the bone phenotype	 notably the altered texture and increased volume of cortical bone (supplementary figure 14b	c)	 but did not result in any hematopoietic abnormalities (supplementary figure 14dâ€“h). The data demonstrate that osteoprogenitor cell-specific effects of Dicer1 deletion underlie the disruption of hematopoiesis and indicate that select subsets of cells in the osteoblast lineage have discrete functions in regulating hematopoiesis.  Emergence of leukemia  Human MDS is characterized by transformation to acute myeloid leukemia in a significant subset of patients. Strikingly	 we observed the infrequent occurrence of myeloblastic tumors in OCDfl/fl mice. Four mice were observed to have facial tumors (estimated frequency 2/100 OCDfl/fl animals) of which three animals were available for detailed analysis (figure 4a). Tumors appeared at the age of 2â€“3 weeks and mice died at the age of 4â€“5 weeks. Analyses in a separate cohort of animals demonstrated that dysplastic features were already present in three week old animals (supplementary figure 15)	 suggesting that tumorigenesis occurred in the context of existing dysplasia. Histological examination of the tumors established a diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma (figure 4b)	 a soft-tissue complication of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Dicer1 had not been deleted in these myeloid sarcomas as determined by genomic PCR (figure 4c). Comparative genomic hybridization to germline DNA revealed genetic abnormalities in all tumors	 providing direct evidence that the micro-environment facilitated clonal evolution of tumor cells (figure 4d and supplementary figure 16). Cytogenetic abnormalities included amplification of a common (27 Kb) region on chromosome 14qC1 in two tumors	 the biological relevance of which	 in the absence of known genes related to tumorigenesis in this region	 is under investigation.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Myeloid sarcoma and acute myelogenous leukemia in OCD fl/fl mice The myeloid sarcomas displayed infiltrative behavior into surrounding tissues (supplementary figure 17) and were diagnosed in a context of myelocytosis (figure 4e)	 anemia (figure 4f)	 profound splenomegaly with infiltration of blasts (figure 4g	h) and a marked increase in blasts with a monocytic appearance in blood and bone marrow (figure 4iâ€“k). This combination of findings strongly resembles monoblastic AML (FAB subtype AML M4/M5) in humans and fulfilled all criteria for the diagnosis of AML in mice12. Although the presence of myeloid sarcoma and acute monocytic leukemia-like disease in OCDfl/fl mice was sporadic	 myeloid sarcomas were never observed in OCDfl/+ or Osx-Cre- mice (which were four-fold more abundant than mutant animals) and the occurrence of spontaneous AML in mice at an age of 2â€“3 weeks is unprecedented to our knowledge. Taken together	 these data demonstrate that disruption of Dicer1 from cells of the osteoblastic lineage causes myelodysplasia in mice recapitulating key characteristics of human MDS	 including the propensity to develop AML.  Deletion of Shwachman-Diamond-Bodian Syndrome gene  To obtain insight into the genes and molecular pathways in osteolineage cells driving the disruption of hematopoiesis in OCDfl/fl mice	 we performed gene expression profiling of primary OCDfl/+ and OCDfl/fl osteolineagecells (GFP+CD45âˆ’linâˆ’CD31âˆ’). Microarray analysis revealed a broad changes in the transcriptome in OCDfl/fl osteolineage cells with differential expression of 656 genes (p-value â‰¤ 0.05	 Studentâ€™s t test) representing a wide array of functional groups (supplementary table 1). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed significant enrichment (FDR < 0.05) of genes involved in early osteoblastic differentiation and commitment 21	 including the Wnt/Î²catenin9 and TGF-Î² signaling pathway22	 in OCDfl/+ samples (supplementary table 2). Notably differentially expressed genes and pathways further included stress response genes and cytokines (supplementary tables 2 and 3) with significant downregulation of the Shwachman-Diamond-Bodian Syndrome gene (Sbds) (2.43-fold; p=0.028	 table S1) of particular interest because of its association with human disease. Inactivating mutations in the Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond Syndrome (Sbds) gene are highly associated with the clinical syndrome23 characterized by skeletal abnormalities	 bone marrow failure with mild myelodysplastic changes	 the propensity to develop MDS and secondary AML	 increased intramedullary apoptosis of hematopoietic progenitors and exocrine pancreatic dysfunction. Studies knocking down the Sbds gene in hematopoietic progenitor subsets have failed to recapitulate key features of the clinical phenotype24 and a role of the bone marrow micro-environment in the pathogenesis of the syndrome has been suggested25. Targeted deletion of Sbds from osteoprogenitor cells by intercrossing Osterix-Cre mice to mice containing conditional (floxed) Sbds alleles (figure 5a) (S. Zhang et al	 manuscript submitted) resulted in altered texture of the cortical bone (supplemental figure 18a)	 leukopenia and lymphopenia (but not neutropenia) (figure 5b)	 dysplastic features of neutrophils in the peripheral blood (figure 5c) and micromegakaryocytes (figure 5d) with increased vascularity of the bone marrow (figure 5e). Further similarities with OCDfl/fl mice included decreased frequency of B-cells and B-cell progenitors (supplementary figure 18b)	 increased frequency of myeloid cells (supplementary figure 18c) and intramedullary apoptosis of hematopoietic progenitor cells (figure 5f). Collectively	 the data show that conditional deletion of Sbds from osteoprogenitor cells recapitulates key characteristics of OCDfl/fl mice and implicate osteoprogenitor cells in the pathogenesis of the Shwachman-Diamond syndrome.  Figure 5 Figure 5 Targeted deletion of the Sbds gene from osteoprogenitor cells recapitulates many features of the OCD fl/fl phenotype Go to: DISCUSSION These studies show that specific changes in specific mesenchymal cells of the hematopoietic microenvironment may be sufficient to initiate a complex phenotype of disordered homeostasis with similarities to myelodysplasia	 a poorly understood human disease. Further	 we demonstrate the ability of this abnormality to result in the emergence of a clonal neoplasm in a cell type of clearly distinct lineage with distinct secondary genetic changes. The data indicate that individual	 well defined	 mesenchymal microenvironment constituents can be primary enablers of neoplastic changes in a heterologous cell type.  While a series of genetic and epigenetic events in a single cell may be necessary for oncogenesis	 they may not be sufficient and a permissive microenvironment has been hypothesized to be required for frank malignancy to emerge26. Examples of microenvironmental contributions to neoplasia include a necessary mast cell contribution to Nf1 induced neurofibromas27 and mesenchymal cell alteration of epithelial tumor growth kinetics28	29. Changes in a tissue microenvironment have also been suggested to precede and promote the initiation of genetic events by creating a â€œpre-malignantâ€ state characterized by disruption of quiescence inducing signals or increases in proliferative signaling30	31. This has been validated experimentally with altered TGF-Î² signaling in tissue fibroblasts32 and with myeloid progenitor expansion following RAR-Î³ deletion in bone marrow or Rb deficiency in hematopoietic and microenvironmental cells33	34.  Our findings further the paradigm of malignancy resulting from the interplay of cell autonomous and microenvironmentally determined events and point to the microenvironment as the site of the initiating event that leads to secondary genetic changes in other cells. It is therefore possible to envision a â€˜niche-basedâ€™ model of oncogenesis whereby a change in a specific microenvironmental cell can serve as the primary moment in a multi-step process toward malignancy of a supported	 but distinct cell type. Signals from the microenvironment may select for subsequent transforming events and therefore such signals may represent candidate therapeutic targets in both treatment and prevention strategies.  Whether osteoprogenitor cell abnormalities play a role in the pathogenesis of human MDS and leukemia cannot be discerned from our studies. MDS is a heterogeneous disorder in which cytogenetics can be normal or reveal specific clonal lesions such as deletion of 5q. A role for the microenvironment in MDS has been raised	 and reduced osteoblast surface and unchanged bone volume similar to our OCDfl/fl model has been reported35. Our findings raise the possibility that microenvironmental alterations may precede and facilitate clonal evolution in MDS. Studies examining patient samples will explore this possibility.  The Sbds studies provide further suggestive links to human disease. The human syndrome combines features seen in our model and raises the issue of whether both the pathophysiology of the disorder and the difficulty in treating this syndrome with bone marrow transplantation is in part due to a microenvironmental defect in the bone marrow.  The function of Sbds is itself unclear	 but it has been implicated in ribosomal biogenesis23 and may therefore share with Dicer1 the ability to modulate the gene expression â€˜landscape.â€™ While we pursued Sbds because its expression was decreased in the absence of Dicer1	 levels in OCSfl/fl are likely to be even lower and as a consequence	 may not faithfully portray the role of Sbds in our model. We therefore regard Sbds as a candidate participant in the phenotype of OCDfl/fl mice	 but further studies will be needed to define the collaborating molecules causing the hematopoietic abnormalities.  These studies were initiated focusing on the stem cell niche	 but the results indicate that individual microenvironment constituents can serve as regulators of tissue functions beyond that of stem cell support. Osteoprogenitor dysfunction induced altered proliferation and differentiation of both HSCs and distinct hematopoietic progenitor subsets and induced changes in the tissue architecture. Within a tissue microenvironment	 certain elements may have far broader	 integrative functions as the osteoprogenitor cells did here. There may be a hierarchy of activity within niche components as well as the cells they regulate. Our studies provide the rationale for further exploration of the complexity of mesenchymal â€˜stromaâ€™ and the role specific mesenchymal subsets may play as primary regulators of normal and disordered tissue function.  Go to: METHODS SUMMARY Mice  Osx-Cre transgenic mice9	 Ocn-Cre transgenic mice20 and floxed Dicer1 mice10	 have been described. B6.SJL-Ptprca Pep3b/BoyJ mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory.  Transplantation  For competitive transplantation	 5 Ã— 105 bone-marrow cells from 6-week-old OCD fl/+ or OCD fl/fl (CD45.2) littermates admixed with 5 Ã— 105 CD45.1+ (competitor) WT cells were injected into lethally irradiated (9 Gy	 split dose) BL6-SJL (CD45.1+) mice. For â€œ wt into mutantâ€ experiments	 wildtype congenic BL6/SJL (CD45.1+) bone marrow cells (1 Ã— 106 cells/recipient) were transplanted into lethally irradiated 4 week old OCD fl/+ and OCD fl/fl (CD45.2+) recipients. For â€œ mutant into wtâ€ experiments	 OCD fl/+ or OCD fl/fl (CD45.2+) were transplanted into lethally irradiated 4 week old BL6/SJL(CD45.1+) animals. Donor cell engraftment was confirmed by FACS.  hromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) is recommended as the first-line diagnostic test for children with global developmental delay	 intellectual disability	 autism spectrum disorder and multiple congenital anomalies (Miller et al.	 2010)	 and has been reported to have a diagnostic yield of ~10â€“15% (Miller et al.	 2010; Coulter et al.	 2011; Ellison et al.	2012	 Henderson et al.	 2014). The utility of CMA in clinical practice has been debated; however	 more common alterations in management include referrals to subspecialists for specific organ evaluations	 adjustment to pharmacotherapy and initiating tumour surveillance (Coulter et al.	 2011; Ellison et al.	 2012; Henderson et al.	 2014). 14q32 microdeletion syndrome is a rare microdeletion syndrome. Piccione et al. (2010)	 Youngs et al. (2011) and Youngs et al. (2012) reviewed 12 cases with terminal deletions and 10 patients with interstitial deletions	 respectively. The majority of the patients were diagnosed on routine G-banded karyotype (Piccione et al.	 2010)	 with only three patients being reported with microdeletion on CMA (Piccione et al.	 2010; Youngs et al. 	2011	 2012Youngs et al. 	2011	 2012). In six of the 10 patients with interstitial deletions of 14q32	 the large size of their deletions made genotypeâ€“phenotype correlation difficult. In this report	 we describe the first case of 14q32 microdeletion in an individual of Chinese ethnicity and the third reported case of interstitial microdeletion in the 14q32 region. In addition	 the microdeletion included the DICER1 gene. Mutations of DICER1 has been associated with an increased risk for pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB)	 ovarian Sertoliâ€“Leydig tumours	 cystic nephroma and thyroid gland hyperplasia (Foulkes et al.	 2011; Rio Frio et al.	 2011; Schultz et al.	 2011; Slade et al.	 2011; Doros et al.	 2012). The incidence of these tumours are rare and there is no standard routine surveillance strategy to detect them (Doros et al.	 2014). Back to Top Clinical report Our patient is a 3-year-1-month old girl	 the only child of nonconsanguineous parents of Chinese ethnicity. There was no significant antenatal history. She was born full term by normal vaginal delivery. Her birth weight was 3.3 kg (-0.24 SD). Postnatal history was unremarkable. At 15 months	 she was diagnosed to have scimitar (pulmonary venolobar) syndrome by computed tomography (CT) of the chest	 which was done to evaluate right lung opacity on the radiography done for pneumonia. In addition	 she was noted to have global developmental delay	 with her speech affected most significantly. She received rehabilitation therapy and relocated from Hong Kong to Singapore with her parents when she was 3 years old. She was referred to the genetics clinic for evaluation for suspected genetic syndrome after the developmental paediatrician in Singapore noted her facial dysmorphism. At 3 years	 she was nonverbal but could understand simple instructions. She could walk independently but was unable to stand on one leg. She could scribble randomly but was unable to draw or write. She could feed herself but was not toilet-trained. Examination showed that her height was 88.3 cm (-1.63 SD)	 weight was 11.3 kg (-1.91 SD) and head circumference was 48 cm (-0.4 SD). She had thick eyebrows	 wide nasal base	 bulbous nose and hypertrichosis. She was mildly hypotonic with normal power and deep tendon reflexes. On auscultation	 her heart sounds were dual	 with systolic murmur and breath sounds decreasing on the right chest. Examination of her other systems was normal. CMA was carried out using the Agilent 4Ã—180K CGH+SNP catalogue array (Agilent Technologies Inc.	 Santa Clara	 California	 USA). Genomic DNA from the patient was hybridized against the Agilent Euro Female reference. Data were scanned at a resolution of 5 Âµm and analysed with the Agilent Cytogenomics software (Agilent Technologies Inc.)	 version 2.5 using the ADM-2 setting that provides a practical average resolution of 50 kbp. CMA showed a 6.684 Mbp deletion at 14q32.12q32.2 (93 765 583â€“100 449 102	" hg19). The deletion affected 31 OMIM genes including DICER1 (Fig. 1).	  Graphic Fig. 1		 Back to Top Discussion Deletions in the 14q32 region are rare (Piccione et al."	 2010; Youngs et al.	 2011; Youngs et al.	 2012). The majority of these patients were diagnosed on cytogenetics	 and the deletion involved a larger region than the deletion detected in our patient. To our knowledge	 only three patients have been reported with microdeletions detected on CMA. However	 one of them had a terminal deletion of chromosome 14q. Hence	 our patient is the third reported case with an interstitial 14q32 deletion that has been molecularly defined (Fig. 1)	" and the first patient of Chinese ethnicity. Table 1 depicts the clinical features in our patient compared with the two other patients who had molecularly defined interstitial overlapping deletions.	  Graphic Table 1		 Deletions of 14q32 have been characterized by developmental delay"	 hypotonia and characteristic facial features such as a broad and flat nasal bridge	 broad philtrum	 thin upper lip and prominent forehead (Youngs et al.	 2011). Our patient shares some of these phenotypes	 as well as additional features such as hypertrichosis	 thick eyebrows and scimitar syndrome. Characterization of further 14q32 deletions by CMA delineates the genes affected and enables genotypeâ€“phenotype correlations. The 14q32 microdeletion in our patient deleted one copy of the entire DICER1 gene. DICER1 encodes an RNase endonuclease involved in the production of microRNA (miRNA). miRNA plays important roles in regulating protein expression in organogenesis and oncogenesis	 but also in metabolism	 morphogenesis	 cell fate determination	 cell proliferation and apoptosis. Mutations in DICER1 have been associated with DICER1 syndrome (Foulkes et al.	 2011; Slade et al.	 2011). DICER1 syndrome is associated with increased risk of developing tumours such as PPB	 ovarian Sertoliâ€“Leydig tumour	 cystic nephroma and multinodular goitre (Bahubeshi et al.	 2010; Foulkes et al.	 2011; Rio Frio et al.	 2011; Schultz et al.	 2011; Slade et al.	 2011; Doros et al.	 2014; De Kock et al.	 2014c). Other rarer tumours that have been reported include rhabdomyosarcoma	 pituitary blastoma	 nonepithelial ovarian tumours	 pineoblastoma	 medulloblastoma	 intraocular medulloepithelioma and Wilmâ€™s tumour (Bahubeshi et al.	 2010; Foulkes et al.	 2011; Slade et al.	 2011; Doros et al.	 2012; Heravi-Moussavi et al.	 2012; De Kock et al.	 2014a; 2014b). Overall	 the risk of malignancy is estimated to be low in individuals with mutations in DICER1 (Slade et al.	 2011). DICER1 has been shown to be a haploinsufficient tumour suppressor in a mouse model (Kumar et al.	 2009; Lambertz et al.	 2010). However	 exome sequencing and miRNA analysis of PPB mesenchymal tissue suggested a two-hit tumour suppressor model. Germline loss-of-function mutations in combination with somatic missense mutations in the RNase IIIb domain lead to defective cleavage of 5 prime-derived miRNA with retention of loop sequences. The retention is hypothesized to cause premature degradation of 5 prime-derived transcripts (Pugh et al.	 2014). Most of the reported abnormalities in DICER1 are point mutations (missense	 nonsense and frameshift) except for one family with multinodular goitre and Sertoliâ€“Leydig cell tumour	 which had an intragenic deletion of exon 21 of DICER1 (Sabbaghian et al.	 2014). Based on our current understanding of the pathophysiological mechanism	 our patient	 who has a deletion of the entire DICER1 gene	 may be at risk of developing these tumours. The mode and frequency of surveillance for PPB remains unclear. More than 90% of PPB occurs before the age of 6. Chest radiograph is unable to detect small cysts while MRI has limited value in detecting lung lesions. CT chest has the highest sensitivity but the radiation involved is significant. Sabapathy et al. (2015) proposed a PPB screening strategy for carriers of a DICER1 mutation using a combination of radiography and CT of the chest. Using decision analysis software	 they concluded that the risk of radiation-induced cancer in screened populations is lower compared with the risk of undetected cancers in unscreened populations. However	 this is yet to be proven on a prospectively recruited cohort. It remains unknown whether early detection will improve survival. The surveillance of ovarian	 renal and thyroid tumours can be performed with noninvasive ultrasound scans (Doros et al.	 2014)	 although there is no consensus on the frequency and duration of surveillance. The patient with interstitial 14q32 deletion described by Piccione et al. (2010) is currently about 13 years old. She is now obese and has no new dysmorphic features. She has not developed any tumour (M. Piccione	 personal communication). The patient with interstitial 14q32 deletion described by Youngs et al. has not developed any tumour either (M. G. Butler	 personal communication). In summary	 this is the first report of a patient of Chinese ethnicity with 14q32 microdeletion	 which includes the DICER1 gene. DICER1 is a tumour suppressor gene with low to moderate penetrance and a broad phenotype	 especially childhood cancer. The clinical utility of surveillance needs to be balanced against the risk of radiation-induced cancer. Further reports	 especially on long term follow-up of patients with deletion of the entire DICER1 gene	 will clarify whether these individuals should be screened routinely for tumours.  Tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) largely express an alternatively activated (or M2) phenotype	 which entails immunosuppressive and tumour-promoting capabilities. Reprogramming TAMs towards a classically activated (M1) phenotype may thwart tumour-associated immunosuppression and unleash anti-tumour immunity. Here we show that conditional deletion of the microRNA (miRNA)-processing enzyme DICER in macrophages prompts M1-like TAM programming	 characterized by hyperactive IFN-Î³/STAT1 signalling. This rewiring abated the immunosuppressive capacity of TAMs and fostered the recruitment of activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) to the tumours. CTL-derived IFN-Î³ exacerbated M1 polarization of Dicer1-deficient TAMs and inhibited tumour growth. Remarkably	 DICER deficiency in TAMs negated the anti-tumoral effects of macrophage depletion by anti-CSF1R antibodies	 and enabled complete tumour eradication by PD1 checkpoint blockade or CD40 agonistic antibodies. Finally	 genetic rescue of Let-7 miRNA activity in Dicer1-deficient TAMs partly restored their M2-like phenotype and decreased tumour-infiltrating CTLs. These findings suggest that DICER/Let-7 activity opposes IFN-Î³-induced	 immunostimulatory M1-like TAM activation	 with potential therapeutic implications.

In mouse models of cancer	 tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) sustain angiogenesis and suppress T-cell-mediated anti-tumour immunity2	 3. Although the attributes of TAMs in human cancer remain elusive	 their tumour-promoting functions in mouse models are consistent with clinical studies showing that high macrophage numbers are associated with increased angiogenesis	 metastasis	 and/or a poor prognosis in several cancer types4.  In mice	 the pro-tumoral functions of TAMs are in part instructed by T-helper (Th)-2 cytokines	 such as interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-10	 which can stimulate TAMs to acquire an alternatively activated	 or â€˜M2-likeâ€™	 phenotype5	 6. However	 molecularly distinct TAM subsets	 which populate different tumour microenvironments	 can be identified within the spectrum of M2-like activation7	8	 9. At one end of the spectrum are TAMs that exhibit a mixed M1/M2 phenotype (hereafter referred to as â€˜M1-likeâ€™)	 characterized by a more pronounced pro-inflammatory profile and higher expression of major histocompatibility class (MHC)-II and co-stimulatory molecules7	8	 9. The Th1 cytokine interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³) can induce naive monocytes/macrophages to acquire a markedly pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic M1 phenotype10	 suggesting a role for IFN-Î³ in M1-like TAM programming. However	 a number of M1-antagonizing tumour-derived factors prevent the full manifestation of anti-tumoral	 M1 macrophage activation in tumours5	 11. Enforcing M1 programming of TAMs may	 therefore	 curb their tumour-promoting functions and help stimulate anti-tumour immunity12	13	14	 15.  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a large class of small non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate transcript levels through sequence-dependent recognition mechanisms. Mature miRNAs are processed from hairpin-shaped precursor miRNAs by the RNAse-III enzyme DICER16. Dicer1 knockout mice	 which have impaired miRNA activity	 die early during development17. Although most miRNA knockout mice are viable or lack an obvious pathological phenotype18	 the conditional inactivation of DICER in selected adult tissues has shown the requirement of miRNA activity for cell homeostasis in various biological processes	 such as haematopoiesis and angiogenesis19.  Macrophages express detectable amounts of several hundred miRNA species20	21	22	 some of which modulate macrophage ontogeny	 differentiation and/or activation23. Recent reports have also begun to unravel the properties of individual miRNAs in TAMs. For example	 miR-511-3p	 miR-155-5p and miR-142-3p were all shown to limit M2-like macrophage activation in tumours9	24	25	 26. In this study	 we genetically inactivated DICER in macrophages to analyse the effects of broadly disrupting miRNA activity on the immunoregulatory functions of TAMs.  RESULTS Abstractâ€¢ Introductionâ€¢ RESULTSâ€¢ DISCUSSIONâ€¢ Methodsâ€¢ Referencesâ€¢ Acknowledgementsâ€¢ Author informationâ€¢ Supplementary information T-helper cytokines modulate macrophage DICER IFN-Î³	 with or without lipopolysaccharide	 detectably decreased DICER messenger RNA and protein levels in primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and immortalized macrophages (iBMMs20). Conversely	 IL-4 increased DICER expression (Fig. 1a	 b and Supplementary Fig. 1aâ€“c). Systemic IFN-Î³ slightly decreased Dicer1 transcript levels in subcutaneous Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC)-associated macrophages	 which exhibited a more M1-skewed phenotype (Fig. 1c	 d). However	 Dicer1 levels were similar in M1-like and M2-like TAMs isolated from subcutaneous LLC or MC38 colorectal carcinomas (Supplementary Fig. 1d). Together	 these observations suggest that supraphysiological	 acute availability of IFN-Î³ attenuates DICER activity in macrophages	 a condition that may be blunted by the variegated repertoire of opposing cytokines that typifies the tumour stroma under basal conditions.

Full size image (151 KB) Figures/tables index Next A LysMâ€“Cre transgene mediates efficient Dicer deletion and miRNA depletion in TAMs To investigate the contribution of DICER to the orientation of the macrophage phenotype in cancer	 we crossed homozygous LysMâ€“Cre27 with Dicer1lox/lox (ref. 28) mice to obtain mice with myeloid-cell-specific Dicer1 gene deletion (LysMâ€“Cre;Dicer1âˆ’/âˆ’	 referred to as Dâˆ’/âˆ’). To verify the myeloid-cell-specificity of the LysMâ€“Cre deleter	 we also generated LysMâ€“Cre;ROSAmT/mG mice29. In these mice	 we observed Tomato to green fluorescent protein (GFP) switch specifically in the myeloid cells of several organs and subcutaneous LLCs (Supplementary Fig. 2a	 b).  Dâˆ’/âˆ’ mice were viable and fertile	 and had unperturbed haematopoietic output compared to Dicer-proficient	 LysMâ€“Cre;Dicer1+/+ mice (referred to as D+/+)	 as shown by the similar frequency of mature circulating myeloid and lymphoid cells in the two genotypes (Supplementary Fig. 2c). We then established LLCs in Dâˆ’/âˆ’ and D+/+ mice and isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) F4/80+MRC1low/âˆ’CD11c+ M1-like TAMs	 F4/80+CD11clow/âˆ’MRC1+ M2-like TAMs	 CD11b+Ly6C+ monocytes	 F4/80âˆ’Gr1+ neutrophils	 CD31+CD45âˆ’ endothelial cells (ECs)	 and CD31âˆ’CD45âˆ’ non-endothelial/non-haematopoietic tumour-derived cells. PCR analysis showed biallelic Dicer1 deletion specifically in myeloid-lineage cells (Supplementary Fig. 2d). Furthermore	 miRNAs were depleted	 albeit non-exhaustively	 in both M1-like and M2-like TAMs	 but not in monocytes	 neutrophils or ECs (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 3a). We obtained similar results in subcutaneous MC38 carcinomas (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Thus	 Dâˆ’/âˆ’ mice provided an adequate model to examine the effects of DICER/miRNA deficiency in TAMs.  Figure 2: DICER inactivation in TAMs inhibits tumour growth and alters tumour-infiltrating immune cells.

Full size image (461 KB) Previous Figures/tables index Next DICER inactivation in TAMs inhibits tumour growth and alters tumour-infiltrating immune cells To study tumour growth in Dâˆ’/âˆ’ mice	 we employed three syngenic mouse tumour models: orthotopic MMTV-PyMT mammary adenocarcinomas; subcutaneous LLC; and subcutaneous MC38 carcinomas. In all models	 macrophage-specific Dicer1 deletion significantly delayed tumour development (Fig. 2bâ€“d). Mammary tumour growth was virtually suppressed in Dâˆ’/âˆ’ mice	 with most of the tumours regressing after a short-lived growth phase. Moreover	 there were significantly fewer pulmonary micrometastases in Dâˆ’/âˆ’ mice either carrying subcutaneous LLCs (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 3c) or injected intravenously with MMTV-PyMT tumour-derived cells (Fig. 2f and Supplementary Fig. 3d)	 compared with D+/+ mice.  We then analysed immune-cell infiltrates in LLC (Fig. 2g) and MC38 (Fig. 2h) tumours. Dicer1 deletion in TAMs did not block their recruitment to the tumours	 but markedly increased the proportion of TAMs expressing an M1-like phenotype. TAM skewing in Dâˆ’/âˆ’ mice was associated with heightened tumour infiltration by CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis showed that CD8+ CTLs sorted from Dâˆ’/âˆ’ tumours expressed higher Ifng	 Gzmb and Prf1 transcript levels	 and hence a more activated phenotype (Fig. 2i). Moreover	 the CD4+ T cells of Dâˆ’/âˆ’ tumours had a more Th1-oriented (TBET+GATA3âˆ’) phenotype (Fig. 2j). Thus	 suppressing DICER activity in macrophages broadly modulated the tumour immune microenvironment. This reprogramming was unlikely to be due to upstream effects on haematopoiesis. Indeed	 the frequency of the main circulating haematopoietic-cell types was similar in tumour-bearing Dâˆ’/âˆ’ and D+/+ mice (Fig. 2k and Supplementary Fig. 3e).  Dicer1-deficient TAMs express a prominent IFN-Î³/STAT1 gene signature We then isolated both total (F4/80+) and M1-like TAMs from LLCs of either Dâˆ’/âˆ’ or D+/+ mice	 and profiled their transcriptomes by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis highlighted a robust Th1/M1 signature in the Dicer1-deficient	 F4/80+ TAMs (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 1). The Dicer1 signature was characterized by prominent activation of type-I and -II IFN	 signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1)	 and IFN-regulatory factor (IRF) signalling	 along with suppression of transforming growth factor-Î² (TGF-Î²)	 IL-10 and STAT6 signalling.

Full size image (228 KB) Previous Figures/tables index Next STAT1 is a key mediator of macrophage responses to IFN-Î³ signalling5	 6. Among the IFN-Î³/STAT1-inducible genes	 the T-cell chemokines Cxcl9 and 10	 the co-stimulatory molecule Cd86	 the transcription factor Irf8	 and the Th1-promoting cytokine Il27 were all upregulated in the Dâˆ’/âˆ’ TAMs (Fig. 3b) and reverberated on whole-tumour cytokine profiles (Fig. 3c). Chemotaxis	 abundance and cytotoxicity of lymphocytes were among the top processes modulated by Dicer1 deletion (Supplementary Table 2). Therefore	 DICER inactivation had rewired the TAM transcriptomes towards a markedly polarized M1 phenotype.  DICER deficiency induces pro- to anti-tumoral TAM conversion The targeted elimination of M2-like TAMs inhibits angiogenesis	 alleviates immunosuppression	 and delays tumour growth in mice30	 31. On the other hand	 the roles of M1-like TAMs have remained more elusive. We used the anti-mouse colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R) antibody 2G2 (ref. 32) to broadly eliminate TAMs in tumour types that contain different proportions of M2 and M1-like TAMs.  Transgenic MMTV-PyMT mice33 develop multiple mammary adenocarcinomas largely populated by M1-like TAMs (Fig. 4a). Consistent with previous observations in a genetic model of macrophage deficiency33	 efficient TAM elimination by 2G2 (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 4a) did not inhibit mammary tumour growth in MMTV-PyMT mice (Fig. 4c)	 suggesting that TAMs are not obviously pro-tumoral in this breast carcinoma model. Conversely	 MC38 and LLC tumours contain greater infiltrates of M2-polarized TAMs (Fig. 4a). 2G2 efficiently depleted both MRC1+ and CD11c+ TAMs (Fig. 4d	 e and Supplementary Fig. 4b) and delayed MC38 and LLC growth in D+/+ mice	 but slightly accelerated tumour growth in Dâˆ’/âˆ’ mice (Fig. 4f and Supplementary Fig. 4c). These results strongly suggest that DICER inactivation had reprogrammed M2 TAMs to an M1-like	 anti-tumoral phenotype	 in LLC and MC38 tumours.

Full size image (553 KB) Previous Figures/tables index Next TAM elimination abated Cd86 and Cxcl9 transcript levels in the MC38 tumours of both D+/+ and Dâˆ’/âˆ’ mice (Fig. 4g)	 indicating that TAMs are the main cell type expressing CD86	 and main source of CXCL9	 in this tumour model. Furthermore	 TAM elimination restored normal (non-elevated) CTL numbers in the tumours of Dâˆ’/âˆ’ mice	 as shown by Cd8a and Ifng gene expression analysis and CD8 immunostaining (Fig. 4g	 h). These findings suggest that Dicer1-deficient TAMs had acquired an enhanced capacity to recruit and/or activate CTLs. Accordingly	 MC38-derived Dâˆ’/âˆ’ TAMs had lower suppressive activity on the proliferation of ovalbumin (OVA)-stimulated OT-I transgenic T cells	 compared with D+/+ TAMs (Fig. 4i).  Representative miRNA levels were similar in splenic CD8+ T cells of naive Dâˆ’/âˆ’and D+/+ mice (Supplementary Fig. 4d). Also	 Dicer1 was not deleted in the T cells of Dâˆ’/âˆ’ tumours (Supplementary Fig. 4e)	 arguing against the possibility that enhanced CTL recruitment and activation were due to T-cell-autonomous effects	 for example	 leakiness of the Cre transgene in the T-cell compartment.  DICER deficiency promotes cell-autonomous M1 macrophage programming BMDMs isolated from tumour-naive Dâˆ’/âˆ’ mice showed highly efficient Dicer1 deletion (Fig. 5a	 b) and miRNA depletion (Fig. 5c).

Furthermore	 Dâˆ’/âˆ’ BMDMs failed to suppress the proliferation of OVA-stimulated OT-I transgenic T cells (Fig. 5e). These findings in BMDMs indicate that DICER deficiency can cell-autonomously initiate M1 programming of macrophages.  Figure 5: DICER deficiency promotes cell-autonomous M1 macrophage programming.

Together	 these observations strongly suggest that cell-autonomous M1 TAM activation initiated by DICER/miRNA deficiency was sustained non-cell-autonomously through the de novo recruitment of IFN-Î³-producing CTLs.  Rescue of Let-7d-5p activity in TAMs opposes the effects of DICER inactivation Although individual miRNAs are predicted to modulate the stability of multiple transcripts	 only a fraction of the miRNAs expressed in a given cell exhibit detectable activity34. To identify candidate miRNAs whose depletion could account for the transcriptomic changes observed in Dâˆ’/âˆ’ TAMs	 we used two independent	 bioinformatics-based approaches.  As a first approach	 we searched for miRNAs whose top-300 predicted targets (ranked according to TargetScan-assigned score35) were significantly upregulated by Dicer1 deletion in TAMs. We found that the predicted targets of the Let-7-5p family members were globally upregulated in Dâˆ’/âˆ’ versus D+/+ TAMs (Fig. 7a	 b). We validated the robustness of the prediction approach by analysing in silico the effects of genetic miR-155 or miR-223 deletion on the transcriptome of B cells and neutrophils36	 respectively (Supplementary Fig. 6aâ€“d). As a second strategy37	 we analysed 171 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) samples with paired miRNA-Seq and mRNA-Seq TCGA data (see Methods). We first identified associations among miRNA and mRNA expression levels (miRNA/mRNA signatures) across the AML samples. We then used the AML miRNA/mRNA signatures to identify miRNAs putatively involved in the regulation of the gene signature of Dâˆ’/âˆ’ TAMs. Let-7 was among the miRNAs inferred to have their activity inhibited in Dâˆ’/âˆ’ versus D+/+ TAMs (Supplementary Fig. 6eâ€“g).

Full size image (398 KB) Previous Figures/tables index Next Motivated by the results in silico	 we sought to reintroduce Let-7-5p activity in Dicer1-deficient TAMs. To this aim	 we generated lentiviral vectors (LVs) that can express a mature miRNA in Dicer1-deficient cells by means of the DICER-independent miR-451 backbone38. We used a bidirectional spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) promoter	 which is preferentially active in myeloid cells9	24	25	26	 to coordinately express the hybrid miRNA and orange fluorescent protein (OFP; Fig. 7c). We validated the miRNA-rescue LV platform using Dâˆ’/âˆ’ immortalized endothelial cells20 (iECs) (Supplementary Fig. 7a). Also	 transduction of Dâˆ’/âˆ’ BMDMs with a hybrid miR-451/Let-7d-5p LV	 which expresses a representative Let-7-5p-family member	 restored Let-7d-5p levels to quasi-physiological levels in the macrophages (Fig. 7d).  To rescue Let-7d-5p activity in Dâˆ’/âˆ’ TAMs	 we transduced Dâˆ’/âˆ’ haematopoietic stem/progenitors cells (HS/PCs) with the hybrid miR-451/Let-7d-5p or a control LV not expressing miRNA sequences. We then transplanted the transduced HS/PCs into irradiated congenic CD45.1 mice	 to obtain LV-Let-7d and LV-control haematochimaeric mice respectively. Seven weeks post-HS/PC transplant	 we inoculated MC38 cancer cells subcutaneously in the mice. Re-expression of Let-7d-5p did not obviously alter haematopoiesis in the transplanted mice	 either before (Supplementary Fig. 7b	 c) or after (Supplementary Fig. 7d	 e) tumour challenge. Importantly	 Let-7d-5p expression was enhanced in TAMs (Fig. 7e) but not T cells (Fig. 7f) isolated from the tumours of LV-Let-7d mice.  Enforced expression of Let-7d-5p increased both M2-like TAMs and the M2/M1 TAM ratio	 and lowered CTL numbers	 in the tumours (Fig. 7g). Moreover	 it attenuated the expression of key Dâˆ’/âˆ’ signature genes	 such as Stat1	 Irf8	 Itgax (CD11c)	 Cd86	 Ifng and Cxcl9	 as well as IFN-Î³ protein (Fig. 7h	 i). These results suggest that Th1/M1 immune programming in Dâˆ’/âˆ’ tumours was	 at least partly	 dependent on impaired Let-7 activity in TAMs. However	 the rescue of wild-type parameters by Let-7d-5p was incomplete	 possibly owing to non-exhaustive reconstitution of haematopoiesis by LV-transduced HS/PCs (Supplementary Fig. 7b). Accordingly	 tumour growth kinetics did not differ between LV-Let-7d and LV-control mice (Supplementary Fig. 7f).  We then examined the immunostimulatory properties of Dâˆ’/âˆ’ and D+/+ BMDMs	 in which we respectively enforced or suppressed Let7-5p activity. Enforcing Let-7d-5p in Dâˆ’/âˆ’ BMDMs disabled their capacity to stimulate the proliferation of allogenic CD4+ T cells in a mixed leukocyte reaction (Fig. 7j). To suppress Let-7-5p activity in D+/+ macrophages	 we used a LV to overexpress LIN28A	 a miRNA-binding protein that blocks the maturation of primary Let-7 miRNAs39. LIN28A overexpression in iBMMs (Fig. 7k) efficiently inhibited representative Let-7 miRNAs (Fig. 7l) and increased the ability of wild-type BMDMs to stimulate the proliferation of allogenic CD4+ T cells in a mixed leukocyte reaction (Fig. 7m).  CD86 is a predicted target of Let-7-5p according to TargetScan35. Consistent with this notion	 enforcing Let-7d-5p significantly decreased CD86 expression in Dâˆ’/âˆ’ BMDMs	 whereas overexpression of LIN28A enhanced its levels in D+/+ macrophages (Fig. 7n	 o). These results agree with gene expression analysis of Dâˆ’/âˆ’ TAMs and flow cytometry analysis of M1 and M2-like LLC TAMs (Fig. 7p)	 and suggest that Let-7-5p may enhance the immunosuppressive functions of TAMs	 at least in part	 by negatively regulating the expression of CD86.  DICER deficiency in TAMs unleashes the efficacy of immunostimulatory antibodies and enables tumour eradication We finally challenged Dâˆ’/âˆ’ and D+/+ mice with immunogenic	 OVA-expressing MC38 tumours (MC38-OVA40). Whereas 90% (18/20) of the D+/+ mice had measurable tumours	 55% (11/20) of the Dâˆ’/âˆ’ mice were tumour-free at termination (day 22â€“24 post-tumour challenge; Fig. 8a). Moreover	 the tumours that had developed in Dâˆ’/âˆ’ mice were	 on average	 smaller than those of control mice.

On the other hand	 anti-CD40 agonistic antibodies can license antigen-presenting cells	 including TAMs	 to prime CTL-mediated anti-tumour responses43. We reasoned that anti-PD1 or CD40 antibodies could enhance CTL responses initiated by Dâˆ’/âˆ’ TAMs. We treated MC38-OVA tumours with either two spaced doses of anti-PD1 or a single dose of anti-CD40 antibodies. Of note	 neither PD1 blockade nor CD40 activation suppressed MC38-OVA tumour growth in most D+/+ mice (Fig. 8a). In contrast	 80% (16/20) and 100% (10/10) of the mice were tumour-free in anti-PD1- and CD40-treated Dâˆ’/âˆ’ mice	 respectively	 at termination. In a further study	 we analysed the survival of Dâˆ’/âˆ’ mice challenged with MC38-OVA tumours and treated with three spaced doses of anti-PD1 or IgG-control antibodies. Whereas 80% (8/10) of the tumours reached the termination criteria in the control group	 100% (10/10) of the tumours regressed in the anti-PD1 group during the 85-day observation window (Fig. 8b	 c). The Dâˆ’/âˆ’ TAMs of MC38 tumours exhibited overall higher PDL1 expression than D+/+ TAMs (Fig. 8d)	 possibly in response to elevated microenvironmental levels of CTL-derived IFN-Î³44	 suggesting a potential mechanism of therapeutic vulnerability to anti-PD1 antibodies.  Finally	 we analysed endogenous	 antigen-specific CTLs in the spleen of tumour-bearing mice. Overall	 Dâˆ’/âˆ’ mice had greater numbers of OVA-specific CTLs than D+/+ mice (Fig. 8e). Moreover	 anti-PD1 slightly increased OVA-specific CTLs in Dâˆ’/âˆ’ mice	 compared with control IgGs (Fig. 8f). As the tumours had regressed in anti-PD1- or CD40-treated Dâˆ’/âˆ’ mice after an initial growth phase	 we could not measure OVA-specific CTLs in the tumours. Taken together	 these results indicate that DICER deficiency in TAMs sensitized tumours to the immunostimulatory activity of two clinically relevant therapeutic antibodies	 achieving complete tumour regressions in mice.  DISCUSSION Abstractâ€¢ Introductionâ€¢ RESULTSâ€¢ DISCUSSIONâ€¢ Methodsâ€¢ Referencesâ€¢ Acknowledgementsâ€¢ Author informationâ€¢ Supplementary information In this study	 we employed a lysozyme-M (LysM)-driven Cre to delete Dicer1 in macrophages. Although the LysMâ€“Cre transgene was active in both monocyteâ€“macrophage and granulocyte-lineage cells	 miRNAs were preferentially depleted in TAMs among tumour-infiltrating myeloid cells. Indeed	 the developmental age and very short half-life of monocytes and neutrophils45 may not allow for the decay of mature miRNAs that had been expressed in LysM-negative haematopoietic progenitor/precursor cells.  Whereas Dicer1 deletion disrupts the repopulating capacity of mouse HSCs46	 its inactivation in myeloid-committed progenitors has less severe effects on haematopoiesis47. Suppression of DICER activity in lysozyme-M+ myeloid cells did not perturb monopoiesis detectably	 nor did it impair the development and recruitment of TAMs to the tumours. Of note	 most examined miRNAs were downregulated in Dicer1-knockout TAMs by about 50â€“70% of their wild-type levels. The lack of exhaustive miRNA depletion may be due to the relatively slow miRNA decay in monocyte-derived TAMs	 or the occurrence of DICER-independent miRNA biogenesis38. Irrespective of the mechanism	 residual miRNA activity in Dâˆ’/âˆ’ TAMs may have prevented more disruptive effects on their development and functions. Our findings are consistent with reports showing unimpeded macrophage/dendritic cell ontogeny on Dicer1 deletion in other monocyte/macrophage lineage cell types48	 49.  Unstimulated Dâˆ’/âˆ’ BMDMs exhibited increased levels of several IFN-Î³/STAT1-inducible genes	 suggesting that M1 macrophage orientation is initiated cell-autonomously in DICER-deficient cells. However	 CTL depletion studies revealed that M1 TAM activation in Dâˆ’/âˆ’ mice was dependent on CTL-derived IFN-Î³ and	 accordingly	 bioinformatics prediction of upstream regulators of the transcriptomes of Dâˆ’/âˆ’ TAMs identified IFN-Î³ as a main activator. On IFN-Î³ stimulation of macrophages	 STAT1 and IRF8 activate transcription of the T-cell chemoattractants Cxcl9 and Cxcl10 (refs 50	51). These chemokines were among the most upregulated genes in Dâˆ’/âˆ’ TAMs; they are critical for CTL recruitment and anti-tumour activity52 and their levels correlate with increased CTL numbers in human melanoma53.  Our findings suggest that DICER and Let-7 activity limit macrophage responsiveness to IFN-Î³ in tumours. Indeed	 the inactivation of DICER unleashed an IFN-Î³-dependent	 paracrine loop between TAMs and CTLs that exacerbated M1 TAM activation	 possibly through a STAT1/CXCL9â€“10 pathway (Fig. 8g). Contrary to unmanipulated TAMs	 which are largely immunosuppressive5	6	 Dâˆ’/âˆ’ TAMs exhibited marked immunostimulatory activity ex vivo	 indicative of a strongly polarized M1 phenotype. The relative contribution of enhanced T-cell chemoattraction (for example	 through CXCL9/10) and cross-priming (for example	 through CD86) to the immunostimulatory capacity of Dicer1-deficient TAMs remain to be investigated.  TAMs not only support tumour growth and progression	 but also influence the activity of anticancer agents	 at least in mouse models of cancer54	 55. Such knowledge has prompted clinical trials testing macrophage-depleting agents	 for example	 CSF1R inhibitors	 in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy56. However	 there is also evidence for TAMs to limit tumour progression in some contexts	 for example	 by facilitating cancer-cell killing in the presence of therapeutic antibodies54. Our results suggest that the relative abundance of M2- and M1-like TAMs determines the therapeutic outcome of TAM elimination in mice. Indeed	 whereas TAM depletion slowed MC38 and LLC growth in D+/+ mice	 it partially rescued tumour growth in Dâˆ’/âˆ’ mice	 consistent with the elimination of an enriched population of anti-tumoral M1 macrophages induced by DICER inactivation. Although little is known of TAM polarization	 activation and function in human cancer4	 our observations suggest that the M2/M1 ratio	 intra-tumoral IFN-Î³ levels	 and/or the DICER status of TAMs may all influence tumour response to macrophage targeting also in human cancer.  Several miRNAs have been implicated in the regulation of macrophage activation and polarization23	57	58	 59; however	 only a few have been studied in the context of cancer9	24	25	26	 60. Bioinformatics modelling of the transcriptional profiles of Dâˆ’/âˆ’ and D+/+ TAMs identified the Let-7-5p-family miRNAs as candidate negative regulators of M1 TAM activation. Restoring Let-7d-5p activity in Dâˆ’/âˆ’ TAMs was sufficient to partly rescue M2 TAM polarization	 attenuate Th1/M1 programming of the tumour microenvironment	 and decrease CTL numbers in the tumours. These findings also argue against the possibility that transcriptional reprogramming of Dicer1-deficient TAMs was largely due to miRNA-independent DICER functions.  Let-7 miRNAs were previously implicated in macrophage activation by inflammatory stimuli23. For example	 M2-polarized mouse BMDMs express higher Let-7c levels than their M1-polarized counterpart	 and transfection of Let-7c mimics into M1-polarized BMDMs enhances IL-4-mediated induction of the M2-associated markers arginase-1 and resistin-like molecule alpha59. Furthermore	 Let-7-5p was shown to negatively regulate M1 macrophage activation by directly repressing TLR4 during infection and inflammation61	62	 63. Our results establish a role for the Let-7-5p family in suppressing IFN-Î³-induced	 immunostimulatory macrophage programming in cancer. Therefore	 they motivate the development of new targeted treatments based on suppressing Let-7 or DICER activity in TAMs.  While the global down-regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) is a common feature of human tumors	 its genetic basis is largely undefined. To explore this question	 we analyzed the consequences of conditional Dicer1 mutation (Dicer1 â€œfloxedâ€ or Dicer1fl) on several mouse models of cancer. Here we show Dicer1 functions as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor gene. Deletion of a single copy of Dicer1 in tumors from Dicer1fl/+ animals led to reduced survival compared with controls. These tumors exhibited impaired miRNA processing but failed to lose the wild-type Dicer1 allele. Moreover	 tumors from Dicer1fl/fl animals always maintained one functional Dicer1 allele. Consistent with selection against full loss of Dicer1 expression	 enforced Dicer1 deletion caused inhibition of tumorigenesis. Analysis of human cancer genome copy number data reveals frequent deletion of DICER1. Importantly	 however	 the gene has not been reported to undergo homozygous deletion	 suggesting that DICER1 is haploinsufficient in human cancer. These findings suggest Dicer1 may be an important haploinsufficient tumor suppressor gene and	 furthermore	 that other factors controlling miRNA biogenesis may also function in this manner.  Keywords: MicroRNAs	 cancer	 Dicer	 tumor suppressor	 mouse models	 haploinsufficiency MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short	 noncoding RNAs that function to suppress post-transcriptionally the expression of target mRNAs	 predominately via inhibition of translation. Such translational inhibition relies on imperfect base-pairing between the miRNA and the target transcript	 with the interaction at nucleotides 2â€“8 (or the â€œseedâ€ region) of the miRNA being required for translational repression. Computational prediction of miRNA targets based on seed regions and sequence conservation has revealed a widespread potential for miRNA-mediated transcript regulation	 with hundreds of putative mRNA targets for an individual miRNA (Bartel 2004).  In line with their broad-based effects	 miRNAs have been proposed to function as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes based on their inhibition of a variety of tumor-suppressive and oncogenic mRNAs	 respectively (Plasterk 2006; Ventura and Jacks 2009). In particular	 three distinct mechanisms have been posited. First	 oncogenic miRNAs can undergo gain of function in tumors. This has been most clearly demonstrated for the miR-17âˆ¼92 cluster	 whose amplification in B-cell lymphomas promotes their development	 potentially through its control of B-cell differentiation (He et al. 2005; Koralov et al. 2008; Ventura et al. 2008). Furthermore	 tumor-suppressive miRNAs could undergo loss of function in tumors. This has been shown for several miRNAs	 including the let-7 family	 whose expression can limit lung tumorigenesis through inhibition of oncogenes like the Ras family and HMGA2 (Esquela-Kerscher et al. 2008; Kumar et al. 2008). In particular	 let-7 family members are in sites of frequent deletion in human tumors	 and their processing is inhibited by the oncogenic Lin-28 proteins (Heo et al. 2008; Newman et al. 2008; Viswanathan et al. 2008; Chang et al. 2009). Finally	 oncogenes can acquire mutations to remove miRNA-binding sites in tumors. This has been described for HMGA2	 whose translocation promotes lipoma development by releasing the transcript from let-7-mediated tumor suppression (Mayr et al. 2007).  We reported a global down-regulation of miRNAs in several types of human and murine cancer (Lu et al. 2005). From this initial study	 it was unclear whether this widespread loss of miRNAs was merely a consequence of tumor development or was functionally related to the disease process. We demonstrated previously that this global loss of miRNAs was functionally relevant to oncogenesis	 as impairment of miRNA maturation enhanced transformation in both cancer cells and a K-Ras-driven model of lung cancer (Kumar et al. 2007). While these studies provide a framework to explain inhibition of miRNA biogenesis in cancer	 the genetic basis of impaired miRNA processing in human cancer has been largely undefined. For a subset of miRNAs	 widespread silencing occurs at the transcriptional level via the c-Myc oncogene (Chang et al. 2008). However	 it has also been shown that such broad reductions in miRNAs can occur post-transcriptionally	 since changes in miRNA levels frequently occur without changes in the levels of the primary miRNA transcript (Thomson et al. 2006). Recently	 it was shown that mutations in the miRNA processing component TARBP2 occur frequently in mismatch repair-deficient colon cancer	 and that these mutations promote tumorigenesis by impaired processing of miRNAs (Melo et al. 2009). While interesting	 these limited cases do not resolve the common global reduction of miRNAs in human cancers. Moreover	 the precise genetics of such changes in tumors is poorly defined	 especially as no components of the miRNA processing pathway have been reported to be completely deleted in human tumors. This is not surprising	 since it has been shown that germline deletion of miRNA processing components Dicer1 and Dgcr8 in mice fails to produce viable progeny (Bernstein et al. 2003; Wang et al. 2007). Thus	 conditional deletion of miRNA processing components provides a powerful means of examining the role of miRNAs in tumorigenesis.  Go to: Results and Discussion We previously reported results using the KrasLSL-G12D strain	 which was either heterozygous or homozygous for a conditional allele of Dicer1 (hereafter referred to as KDfl/+ and KDfl/fl) (Jackson et al. 2001; Harfe et al. 2005). After intranasal infection with adenovirus expressing Cre (Ad-Cre)	 these compound mutant animals developed significantly more lung tumors compared with KrasLSL-G12D mice that were wild type for Dicer1 (hereafter referred to KD+/+); moreover	 Dicer1 mutant mice had a modest shift in histological grade	 further enforcing its role as a tumor suppressor (Kumar et al. 2007). To extend these observations of Dicer1-mediated tumor suppression	 we characterized survival of KD+/+	 KDfl/+	 and KDfl/fl animals after intranasal Ad-Cre infection. Both KDfl/+ and KDfl/fl animals had significantly reduced survival relative to KD+/+ mice (Fig. 1). Surprisingly	 we found that the survival of the KDfl/+ cohort was less than that of KDfl/fl animals. To extend these findings to additional cancer types	 we used a mouse model of soft-tissue sarcoma generated through intramuscular infection with Ad-Cre of KrasLSL-G12D; Trp53fl/fl mice (Kirsch et al. 2007). When we compared survival of KrasLSL-G12D; Trp53fl/fl mice either wild type or heterozygous or homozygous for the conditional allele of Dicer1 (hereafter referred to as KPD+/+	 KPDfl/+	 and KPDfl/fl) intramuscularly infected with Ad-Cre	 we observed a reduction in survival in only the KPDfl/+ cohort (Supplemental Fig. 1). Overall	 these results indicate that induction of heterozygosity for a Dicer1 mutation in tumors can enhance tumor development.  Figure 1. Figure 1. Dicer1 mutation reduces post-infection survival in a genetically engineered mouse model of K-Rasdriven lung cancer. KrasLSL-G12D mice	 either wild type or heterozygous or homozygous conditional for Dicer1 (KD+/+	 KDfl/+	 and KDfl/fl	 respectively)	 were ... These findings stand in opposition to traditional tumor suppressor genes	 in which a homozygous mutation provides a direct advantage to tumor cells while a heterozygous mutation promotes tumorigenesis only after subsequent mutation or inactivation of the remaining wild-type allele. In particular	 the survival disadvantage of KDfl/+ tumors to KDfl/fl suggests active selection against complete loss of Dicer1 in these tumors. To characterize precisely the mutation status of Dicer1 conditionally mutant tumors	 we generated lung cancer cell lines from KPDfl/+ animals and examined the Dicer1 locus for further deletion. As shown in Figure 2	 we observed recombination of the conditional allele of Dicer1 and retention of the wild-type allele	 generating KPD+/âˆ’ lung cancer cells (Fig. 2A). Similar maintenance of the wild-type allele was found in sarcoma cell lines from KPDfl/+ mice (Supplemental Fig. 2A).  Figure 2. Figure 2. Dicer1 undergoes hemizygous loss in lung tumors. (A) DNA was prepared from KrasLSL-G12D mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) either heterozygous conditional or mutant for Dicer1 (KDfl/+ and KD+/âˆ’) and lung cancer cell lines from KPDfl/+ mice	 and ... We further examined Dicer1 recombination in lung cancer cell lines from KPDfl/fl animals. In these cell lines	 we again found evidence of Cre-Lox recombination. However	 the recombination was incomplete	 generating KPDfl/âˆ’ lung cancer cells (Fig. 2B); this incomplete loss of Dicer1 was also observed in sarcoma cell lines from KPDfl/fl mice (Supplemental Fig. 2A). Thus	 it is likely that KDfl/fl lung tumors undergo selection against complete Dicer1 recombination during tumor progression. To determine if complete loss of Dicer1 product occurs	 Dicer1 protein levels were examined in lung cancer cells and sarcomas either wild type or mutant for Dicer1. Although we observed a general reduction in Dicer1 protein in Dicer1 mutant cancer cell lines	 all retained some expression of Dicer1 (Supplemental Fig. 2B). In addition	 resequencing of the Dicer1 ORF in lung cancer and sarcoma cell lines from KPDfl/+ and KPDfl/fl mice revealed no further mutations of the retained Dicer1 allele (data not shown)	 suggesting that complete loss of Dicer1 function is not achieved through second site mutation. In sum	 these data indicate that only partial loss of Dicer1 occurs in these genetically engineered mouse models during tumorigenesis.  Based on the protumorigenic effect of hemizygous mutation of Dicer1 in these tumor models	 we went on to assess the consequence of partial loss of Dicer1 on global miRNA expression. Comparing miRNA profiles in Dicer1 wild-type and heterozygous mutant lung cancer cells	 there was a global decrease in steady-state miRNA levels in KPD+/âˆ’ cells (Fig. 3A; Supplemental Table 1). A small RNA Northern blot analysis verified these reductions in miRNA levels (Fig. 3B). Thus	 a Dicer1 mutation is capable of significantly altering miRNA levels	 even when incomplete.  Figure 3. Figure 3. Hemizygous deletion of Dicer1 causes a global reduction in steady-state miRNA levels. (A) miRNA profiling and hierarchical clustering were performed on lung cancer cell lines either wild type (KPD+/+) or heterozygous for Dicer1 (KPD+/âˆ’ and KPD ... While the genetic analysis of the Dicer1 locus in our mouse cancer models suggested that Dicer1 was functioning as a haploinsufficient tumor suppression gene	 it was still formally possible that Dicer1 mutant tumors eventually underwent complete inactivation of Dicer1 via an alternative mechanism like epigenetic silencing. Thus	 we assessed the consequences of complete loss of Dicer1 in the genetically engineered mouse models. First	 to promote complete loss of Dicer1 in the lung	 we infected KDfl/+ and KDfl/fl mice with a lentivirus expressing Cre (Lenti-Cre). In contrast to the recombinant adenoviruses	 which do not integrate in the genome of the infected cells and are eventually lost	 lentiviral integration is expected to allow for stable	 longer-term expression of Cre and	 more likely	 complete recombination at the Dicer1 locus. Infection of mice with Lenti-Cre led to a striking decrease in tumor burden in KDfl/fl compared with KDfl/+ mice (Supplemental Fig. 3Aâ€“C). This result contrasts sharply with previous studies in which KDfl/+ and KDfl/fl mice created a similar tumor burden after Ad-Cre infection. Notably	 when we isolated DNA from the tumors that did arise in KDfl/fl mice and assessed Dicer1 loss	 all tumors were once again found to have undergone incomplete recombination	 suggesting that there is selection against total Dicer1 loss in lung tumors (Supplemental Fig. 3D).  To further examine the effects of complete Dicer1 loss	 we transduced a set of sarcoma cell lines with CreERT2 to permit tamoxifen-dependent Cre activity. Treatment with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) led to efficient deletion of Dicer1 in vitro (Fig. 4A). To assess the effect of complete Dicer1 loss on tumorigenesis	 we transplanted untreated KPDfl/âˆ’ sarcoma cells expressing CreERT2 into immune-competent hosts	 and recombination was induced by systemic tamoxifen administration. Compared with control treatments	 tamoxifen administration substantially slowed tumor growth in KPDfl/âˆ’ sarcomas (Fig. 4B). Of note	 this system allowed for Cre-mediated deletion of Dicer1	 as the tumors that developed in tamoxifen-treated animals had extensive Dicer1 recombination (Fig. 4C). Importantly	 tumor suppression was not merely an effect of tamoxifen- or Cre-mediated toxicity	 as tamoxifen treatment of animals injected with KPD+/+ sarcoma cells expressing CreERT2 did not impair tumor growth (Supplemental Fig. 4). Taken together	 these studies demonstrate that complete deletion of Dicer1 is deleterious to tumor development	 strongly suggesting that Dicer1 is a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor. Of note	 in a separate study using these cancer cell lines	 A Ravi	 MS Kumar	 C Chin	 T Jacks	 and PS Sharp (in prep.) have shown that full loss of Dicer1 function can be tolerated	 but that Dicer1-null cells have impaired proliferative capacity.  Figure 4. Figure 4. Complete deletion of Dicer1 inhibits sarcoma development. (A) KPDfl/+ and KPDfl/âˆ’ sarcoma cell lines were infected with MSCV.CreERT2.puro. Cre-mediated recombination was induced by treatment with 4-OHT for defined time points. DNA was prepared	 ... While these findings indicate that partial loss of Dicer1 promotes tumor development	 it was not clear whether a comparable situation occurs in human cancer. To explore this question	 we assessed DICER1 copy number data from the Cancer Genome Project at the Sanger Institute (Forbes et al. 2008). In these data sets	 there was frequent loss of one allele of DICER1 (via hemizygous deletion) in several different tumor types (Table 1); similar results were obtained from analysis of copy number data sets of glioblastomas and ovarian cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (data not shown). Although the deletions of DICER1 seen in human cancer were generally broad (>1 Mb)	 there were never high-level amplifications of the DICER1 locus in these tumor sets	 suggesting these losses were not due to random genome instability. More importantly	 homozygous deletion of DICER1 was never reported	 in line with our findings of Dicer1 functioning as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor (Hill et al. 2009; Melo et al. 2009).  Table 1. Table 1. DICER1 is frequently deleted in various human cancers Our results suggest a major cause for the global loss of miRNAs in human cancer (Lu et al. 2005)	 via partial loss of function of the miRNA processing machinery in human tumors. Although the frequent DICER1 single-copy deletion noted in human cancers provides a relevant mechanism of impairing miRNA biogenesis	 additional mechanisms may occur. In particular	 in light of the frequent mutation of TARBP2 in mismatch repair-deficient colon cancer (Hill et al. 2009) and heterozygous germline point mutations in DICER1 in patients with pleuropulmonary blastoma (Melo et al. 2009)	 it is possible that point mutations of DICER1 or other components of the miRNA processing machinery can occur in different types of human cancer. Indeed	 this has been described for DICER1 and DROSHA in a small number of ovarian cancer cell lines (Merritt et al. 2008). Importantly	 while this study describes Dicer1 as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor in the context of K-Ras-driven cancer	 the analysis of miRNA processing machinery mutations has found changes in cancers of a variety of genotypes	 suggesting a broad role for Dicer1 as a tumor suppressor.  Beyond such mutational analyses	 these results represent an expansion of the list of haploinsufficient tumor suppressors to include components of the miRNA processing machinery. The breadth of tumor suppressor genes that function via haploinsufficiency is only beginning to be appreciated (Santarosa and Ashworth 2004). In fact	 the traditional reliance on complete loss of tumor suppressor genes by heterozygous mutation and subsequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is likely to overlook factors whose effects do not require complete loss	 such as p27Kip1 and Dmp1 (Inoue et al. 2001; Muraoka et al. 2002). Moreover	 such analyses are certain to ignore genes like Dicer1	 for which partial loss is advantageous to tumors while complete loss is disadvantageous. As genome-wide studies begin to explore the functional role of chromosomal deletions in human cancer	 it will be important to consider haploinsufficiency of deleted genes in such contexts.  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have the potential to regulate cellular differentiation programs; however	 miRNA deficiency in primary hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) results in HSC depletion in mice	 leaving the question of whether miRNAs play a role in early-lineage decisions un-answered. To address this issue	 we deleted Dicer1	 which encodes an essential RNase III enzyme for miRNA biogenesis	 in murine CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein Î± (C/EBPA)â€“positive myeloid-committed progenitors in vivo. In contrast to the results in HSCs	 we found that miRNA depletion affected neither the number of myeloid progenitors nor the percentage of C/EBPAâ€“positive progenitor cells. Analysis of gene-expression profiles from wild-type and Dicer1-deficient granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs) revealed that 20 miRNA families were active in GMPs. Of the derepressed miRNA targets in Dicer1-null GMPs	 27% are normally exclusively expressed in HSCs or are specific for multipotent progenitors and erythropoiesis	 indicating an altered gene-expression landscape. Dicer1-deficient GMPs were defective in myeloid development in vitro and exhibited an increased replating capacity	 indicating the regained self-renewal potential of these cells. In mice	 Dicer1 deletion blocked monocytic differentiation	 depleted macrophages	 and caused myeloid dysplasia with morphologic features of Pelger-HuÃ«t anomaly. These results provide evidence for a miRNA-controlled switch for a cellular program of self-renewal and expansion toward myeloid differentiation in GMPs.  Introduction  Hematopoiesis is a tightly regulated process of proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) toward mature blood cells. Lineage commitment and differentiation of HSPCs are orchestrated by transcription factors that are expressed at specific developmental stages. For example	 CCAAT/Enhancer-Binding Protein-Alpha (C/EBPA) is a master regulatory transcription factor that is not expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)	 but starts to be expressed in a small fraction of multipotent progenitor (MPP) cells and increases steeply during the transition from the common myeloid progenitor (CMP) toward the GMP. C/EBPA drives granulopoiesis by controlling the expression of myeloid-specific genes.1â€“2  miRNAs belong to a class of small (approximately 22 nt) noncoding RNAs. The RNA-induced silencing complexâ€“bound miRNAs bind to complementary sequences that are predominantly located in the 3â€²-untranslated regions of target mRNAs and regulate gene expression by transcript destabilization and inhibition of protein translation.3 Recently	 the function of miRNAs in myeloid cells has been investigated using mouse models. For example	 miRs-17/20/93/106 promote progenitor cell expansion by targeting Sequestosome-1â€“regulated pathways.4 In addition	 miR-223 negatively regulates myeloid progenitor proliferation and fine-tunes granulocyte differentiation and activity.5 In addition	 miR-146a inhibits the activity of both myeloid and lymphoid cell lineages and plays key roles in the regulation of inflammation.6  DICER1 is an evolutionarily conserved member of the RNase III family of endoribonucleases that is critical for processing of specific precursor hairpin sequences	 the so-called pre-miRNAs	 into miRNAs.7 Genetic deletion of Dicer1 in mice results in early embryonic mortality due to depletion of the Oct-4â€“positive pluripotent embryonic stem cell pool at embryonic day 6-7 (E6-E7).8 A floxed Dicer1 allele (Dicer1fl) has been generated that allows conditional deletion of Dicer1 in a cell type- and developmental stageâ€“specific fashion.9 Hematopoietic lineageâ€“specific conditional deletion of Dicer1 has revealed the involvement of miRNAs in the survival	 maturation	 and homeostasis of peripheral T lymphocytes and in Ab diversity and survival of B lymphocytes.10â‡“â€“12 In addition	 conditional Dicer1 deletion in osteoprogenitors using mice that have Cre recombinase under the transcriptional control of the osterix promoter (Osx-GFP-Cre) results in myeloid dysplasia and acute myelogenous leukemia with acquired genetic abnormalities but intact Dicer1.13  Mouse primary HSCs are impaired by Dicer1 loss and are unable to reconstitute hematopoiesis.14 In addition	 conditional deletion of Ars2	 another gene required for miRNA biogenesis	 in HSCs results in BM failure and increased apoptosis of hematopoietic cells in thymus and spleen.15 Therefore	 the overall contribution of miRNAs to myeloid-lineage specification remains elusive. To address this issue	 we generated a myeloid-specific	 Cebpa-Creâ€“driven Dicer1 deleter mouse strain that also harbors a conditional CRE reporter containing a loxp-flanked stop sequence (LSL) and the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (Eyfp) in the ROSA26 locus (R26-LSL-Eyfp).16 We show that Cebpa-Creâ€“driven Dicer1 deletion did not affect the numbers of myeloid-committed progenitors	 but did play a critical role in the regulation of a developmental program required for normal granulocyte and monocyte/dendritic cell (DC)/macrophages in mice.  Methods  Mice and reconstitution experiments  To generate Cebpa-Cre;R26-LSL-Eyfp;Dicer1wt/fl/Dicer1fl/fl mice	 we crossed mice that contain floxed Dicer1 alleles (Dicer1fl9; a kind gift of Dr P. A. Sharp	 David H. Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research	 Cambridge	 MA) with Cebpa-Cre;R26-LSL-Eyfp reporter mice.2 Fetal livers were obtained on E13.5. Routine genotyping of Dicer1;Cebpa-Cre;R26-LSL-Eyfp mice was performed by PCR assays of DNA from tail or toe biopsies. Sequences of primers are available on request. All primers were obtained from Biolegio. For transplantation	 6- to 8-week-old recipient mice (C57Bl/6; The Jackson Laboratory) were irradiated (8.5 Gy) and tail-vein injected with fetal liver single-cell suspensions. Typically	 cells from each fetal liver were transplanted into 2 recipient mice. Hematopoietic tissues were analyzed 6-10 weeks after transplantation. The percentage chimerism in hematopoietic tissue was detected by flow cytometric analysis of CD45.1 (recipient) and CD45.2 (Dicer1fl/fl and Dicer1fl/wt donor) cells in a total of 8 mice. All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Welfare/Ethics Committee of the Erasmus Medical Center.  Cell culture	 colony assays	 and cytospins  DCs were derived from BM cultures in the presence of GM-CSF as described previously.17 GM-CSFâ€“induced colony formation assays with progenitors from E13.5 fetal livers were performed as described previously.4 Colonies were counted after 7 days of incubation at 37Â°C and 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. For liquid cultures	 E13.5 fetal liver cells were isolated and single-cell suspensions were grown in serum-free CellGro Stem Cell Growth Medium (CellGenix) supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and GM-CSF (10 ng/mL) at a density of 1 Ã— 106 cells/mL for 7 days. For morphologic analysis of the cells	 cytospins were stained with May-GrÃ¼nwald-Giemsa and examined with a Leica DMLB microscope (100Ã— and 40Ã— objectives) and Leica Application Suite Version 2.7.1 R1 software.  Abs	 cell staining	 flow cytometry	 and cell sorting  To obtain BM cell suspensions	 femurs and tibias were crushed in a mortar in PBS with 5% FCS. Cells were passed through a 70-Î¼m nylon sieve and erythrocytes were lysed. Lineage-positive (Lin+) cells were determined with Abs against the following lineage markers: CD3Ïµ	 CD11b	 CD45R/B220	 Ly-6G (Gr-1)	 and Ter119. To recognize HSPC populations	 BM cells were stained with Abs against c-Kit	 Sca-1	 CD34	 and FcÎ³RII/III(CD16/32). Myeloid progenitors were defined as Linâˆ’Sca-1âˆ’c-Kit+CD34+CD16/32low (CMPs)	 Linâˆ’Sca-1lowc-Kit+CD34+CD16/32hi (GMPs)	 and Linâˆ’Sca-1âˆ’c-Kit+CD34âˆ’CD16/32low (megakaryocyte/erythroid progenitor [MEPs]). For the analysis of differentiated EYFP+ myeloid cells in BM	 cells were stained with anti-CD11b and antiâ€“Ly-6G Abs. Peripheral blood obtained by submandibular bleeding was treated with erythrocyte lysis buffer and stained with Abs against CD11b	 Ly-6G	 and Ly-6C for the determination of granulocytes and monocytes. Spleen single-cell suspensions were stained with CD11b and Ly-6G. Macrophages were isolated from the peritoneal cavity with 1.5-mL washes using PBS/5% FCS. For identification of macrophages	 the cell suspensions were stained with Abs against F4/80. To identify the in vitro expansion and differentiation toward DCs	 whole BM cultures were stained with Abs against MHC class II and CD11c. To sort progenitors from BM	 Lin+ cells were depleted before staining with the Mouse Hematopoietic Progenitor (Stem) Cell Enrichment Set (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A forward-side scatter gate excluded cell debris and remaining red blood cells. All sorted populations were more than 95% pure as determined by reanalysis. A full list of Abs used for flow cytometry and suppliers is given in supplemental Table 5 (available on the Blood Web site; see the Supplemental Materials link at the top of the online article).  Gene and miRNA expression profiling  EYFP+ GMPs were sorted into RLT buffer (QIAGEN). RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Micro Kit (QIAGEN). After one step of linear amplification with the RNA MessageAmp II aRNA Kit (Applied Biosystems/AmbionX)	 aRNA was labeled and hybridized on the Mouse Genome 430 Affymetrix 2.0 Array according to standard protocols. Concentrations and purity of RNA samples were determined on a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Isogen Life Science). RNA integrity was confirmed on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with 6000 nano and pico chips. Microarray data were normalized with the Affymetrix Microarray Suite (MAS Version 5.0). All microarray data are available on the Gene Expression Omnibus under accession number GSE35844. To confirm the expression changes in some target genes	 cDNA was produced from 1Î¼g of aRNA using Superscript II (Invitrogen)	 and quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Kit (QIAGEN). Primers were obtained from Biolegio. The Î”Ct value of Dicer1Î”/Î” and Dicer1wt/Î” versus Dicer1 wild-type (Dicer1wt) cells was calculated. The fold induction was calculated by the 2âˆ’Î”Ct method.  miRNAs were isolated using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit and RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit (QIAGEN) according to manufacturer's protocols. For miRNA profiling	 TaqMan Array Rodent MicroRNA A Cards Version 2.0	 which enables quantification of 375 mouse miRNAs and 6 controls	 were used according to the manufacture's protocol for Megaplex Pools With Preamplification (Applied Biosystems) using the ABI PRISM 7900HT machine (Applied Biosystems).  Statistics  TargetScan Version 5.2 (http://www.targetscan.org) was used to identify putative miRNA targets. Profiling of mRNA expression was performed in triplicate for each experimental condition (Dicer1wt	 Dicer1wt/Î”	 or Dicer1Î”/Î”) and subsequently normalized with MAS5.0. Probe sets considered indistinguishable from the background signal were omitted from further analyses. Identification of the differentially expressed probe sets was performed using the false discovery rate (FDR)â€“corrected P values derived by Limma.18 P < .017 was considered statistically significant. We divided the necessary significance level (.05) by the number of pairwise comparisons	 in our case	 3. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to infer differences between cumulative distribution functions	 and P < .05 was considered significant. The Fisher exact test was used to infer enrichment of de-repression for mRNA targets from the identified miRNAs. A FDR-corrected P < .05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed with R Version 2.12 software (http://www.r-project.org).  Results  Cebpa-Creâ€“driven deletion of Dicer1 does not affect the number of HSPCs  In hematopoietic cells	 Cebpa starts to be expressed at the MPP stage and defines a subpopulation that is instructed to develop toward the myeloid lineage	2 making it a suitable promoter to drive Dicer1 deletion for studying the role of miRNAs in myelopoiesis. Whereas the Cebpa-Cre;Dicer1wt/fl mice were viable and born at Mendelian ratios	 the Cebpa-Cre;Dicer1fl/fl mice died rapidly after birth. This phenotype can be largely explained by the fact that the Cebpa promoter is highly active during the maturation of the respiratory epithelium in late gestation19 and deletes Dicer1. Lack of Dicer1 is detrimental to these cells	 similar to Sonic Hedgehog (Shh)â€“Cre conditional Dicer1-knockout mice.20  To investigate whether Dicer1 deletion affects hematopoiesis in the embryo	 we isolated fetal livers at E13.5. Cells containing recombined Dicer1fl alleles (Dicer1Î”) can be identified because they also harbor a conditional CRE reporter R26-LSL-Eyfp allele.16 The E13.5 fetal livers of Dicer1 mutants and wild-type were indistinguishable by eye. In addition	 flow cytometric analysis did not show any differences in the fraction of HSCs	 hematopoietic progenitors	 and lineage-negative (Linâˆ’) EYFP+ progenitors in the fetal livers of Dicer1fl/fl and Dicer1wt/fl mice compared with Dicer1wt controls (Figure 1A). To investigate the effects of Cebpa-Creâ€“driven Dicer1 ablation in hematopoietic cells in adult mice and to bypass early death	 E13.5 fetal liver cells were transplanted in lethally irradiated recipients. With this protocol	 the percentage of chimerism in hematopoietic tissue was at least 92% in the reconstituted mice (data not shown). CRE-dependent deletion of Dicer1fl alleles in EYFP+ cells was confirmed by PCR (Figure 1B). Furthermore	 more than 95% of total miRNAs were depleted in Dicer1Î”/Î”;EYFP+ cells (supplemental Table 1). The expression level of the remaining miRNAs was less than 10% compared with normal EYFP+ control cells (supplemental Table 1)	 indicating that Cebpa-Creâ€“mediated deletion of Dicer1 results in an efficient depletion of miRNAs in myeloid progenitor cells in vivo.

Bottom panel: Percentage of EYFP+ cells in the indicated fractions. Previous studies showed that IFN-responsive promoter-driven Cre (Mx-Cre)â€“induced Dicer1 ablation results in a complete depletion of functional HSCs.14 We wondered to what extent Cebpa-driven Dicer1 deletion affects the number of myeloid-committed progenitor cells. In contrast to the results published previously for HSCs	14 in the present study	 Dicer1 deletion did not affect the percentage of myeloid-committed EYFP+ cells in the LSK fraction significantly (Figure 1C and supplemental Figure 1). In addition	 no significant differences in the fraction of EYFP+ Dicer1Î”/Î” CMPs	 GMPs	 or MEPs compared with those of Dicer1wt/Î”-transplanted mice and Dicer1wt mice were observed (Figure 1C). Therefore	 unlike the effect of Dicer1 deletion on HSC maintenance	14 Cebpa-Creâ€“driven Dicer1 deletion did not affect the numbers of myeloid progenitors in mice.  Cebpa-Creâ€“driven deletion of Dicer1 affects GM-CFU outgrowth	 cellular replating capacity	 and myeloid differentiation  We performed GM-CFU assays to determine whether deletion of Dicer1 would affect the expansion and differentiation capacity of GMPs. The number of GM-CFUs obtained with Dicer1Î”/Î” progenitor cells was approximately 50% lower than with Dicer1wt/Î” or Dicer1wt cells (Figure 2A). Colony size also decreased as a result of Dicer1 deletion (data not shown). Morphologic analyses showed a more than 5-fold increase in the number of blast-like cells	 a strongly reduced capacity of the Dicer1Î”/Î” progenitors to differentiate toward macrophages	 and the appearance of dysplastic neutrophils (Figure 2B). Dicer1Î”/Î” progenitor cells gained the ability to form secondary and tertiary colonies after serial replatings	 which coincided with a regained self-renewal potential	 a blast-like morphology	 and a strongly reduced differentiation capacity of the cells (Figure 2A-B). In GM-CSFâ€“containing liquid cultures	 Linâˆ’;Dicer1Î”/Î” progenitors were unable to mature toward macrophages	 but instead showed features of dysplastic myeloid cells	 including the Pelger-HuÃ«t anomaly	 which is characterized by neutrophils with a hyposegmented nucleus Linâˆ’ Dicer1Î”/Î” BM cells failed to differentiate toward BM-derived DCs (Figure 2D). These results indicate that Dicer1 is essential for definitive maturation of GMPs toward both the neutrophil and monocyte/macrophage/BMâ€“derived DC lineage in vitro.

Cells were isolated from dishes	 counted	 and replated under the same conditions. Colonies consisting of more than 50 cells were counted after 7 days of growth.

Cebpa-Creâ€“driven deletion of Dicer1 causes myeloid dysplasia and monocyte/macrophage depletion in vivo  Next	 we investigated whether the aberrant myeloid differentiation of GMPs observed in vitro also occurs in vivo. Dicer1Î”/Î” BM neutrophils showed increased levels of CD11b (a marker for myeloid cells) and a reduced Ly-6G (a marker for neutrophilic differentiation) expression compared with Dicer1wt/Î” (similar to Dicer1wt; Figure 3A). Whereas Dicer1wt/Î” neutrophils appeared normal	 Dicer1Î”/Î” cells showed aberrant nucleus morphologies (Figure 3B) of which approximately 20% were hyposegmented or bilobed. Furthermore	 Ly-6G+Dicer1Î”/Î” granulocytes were nearly absent in the peripheral blood and spleen (Figure 3C-D	G)	 suggesting that the aberrant neutrophils were incapable of emigrating from the BM.

Concerning monocytic/macrophage development	 whereas Dicer1wt/Î” monocytes appeared in 3 stages of differentiation: high Ly-6C (immature)	 intermediate	 and low Ly-6C (mature)	22 the relative number of mature Dicer1Î”/Î” monocytes was strongly reduced (Figure 3E). Moreover	 we observed a strongly reduced percentage of EYFP+ macrophages in the abdominal cavity of Dicer1Î”/Î”â€“transplanted mice compared with EYFP+;Dicer1wt/Î” controls (Figure 3F). No CD11b+ cells could be detected in the spleen of Dicer1Î”/Î”â€“transplanted mice (Figure 3G). Dicer1Î”/Î” recipients survived for at least 10 months devoid of any sign of myeloproliferative disease or leukemia development.  Twenty miRNA families are active in GMPs and repress expression programs characteristic of HSCs and erythropoiesis  To determine how deletion of Dicer1	 and the resulting loss of miRNA expression	 affects the gene expression landscape of GMPs	 we performed gene-expression analyses of Dicer1 mutant and control GMPs. miRNA-expression profiling of EYFP+ Dicer1wt GMPs identified 104 miRNAs expressed in GMPs (supplemental Table 2). To examine the activities of these miRNAs	 we compared the transcriptome of Dicer1wt	 Dicer1wt/Î”	 and Dicer1Î”/Î” GMPs. Transcripts with predicted binding sites for identified miRNAs tended to be up-regulated in Dicer1-null GMPs compared with transcripts without such sites (P < 2.2 Ã— 10âˆ’16 by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; Figure 4A)	 which is indicative of the activity of the miRNAs in these cells. Transcripts containing putative binding sites for the identified miRNAs had a significant propensity to be up-regulated in the Dicer1Î”/Î” cells (P < 2.2 Ã— 10âˆ’16 by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test)	 but not in the Dicer1wt/Î” cells (Figure 4B). Deletion of Dicer1 in GMPs revealed 784 significant differentially expressed probe sets (FDR-corrected P < .05; Figure 4C). Unsupervised clustering of these probe sets showed that the gene-expression pattern of Dicer1wt/Î” GMPs was changed but still appeared very similar to wild-type GMPs (Figure 4C)	 again indicating that heterozygous deletion of Dicer1 did not strongly affect the miRNA-regulated targets in GMPs.

(A) Cumulative distribution plot of the log fold change of transcripts that contain miRNA-binding sites for the identified miRNAs (supplemental Table 2) and messages that do not contain sites compared with wild-type (P < 2.2 Ã— 10âˆ’16). (B) Cumulative distribution plot of log fold change for mRNA containing miRNA-binding sites for the identified miRNAs (supplemental Table 2) in the indicated populations. The expression ratio of most messages in Dicer1Î”/Î” cells over Dicer1wt/Î” and Dicer1wt are skewed toward higher positive fold changes compared with Dicer1wt/Î” over Dicer1wt (P < 2.2 Ã— 10âˆ’16). (C) Significant differentially expressed genes between GMP wild-type and Dicer1Î”/Î” cells (FDR-corrected P < .05) were unsupervised clustered with GPLOTS (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gplots/index.html). Cebpa-Creâ€“mediated deletion of Dicer1 in GMPs resulted in 300 significantly up-regulated transcripts (368 probe sets	 supplemental Table 3). The up-regulation of some of these genes was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (supplemental Figure 2). A set of transcripts that are experimentally confirmed miRNA targets	 such as Bcl2L11 (Bim)	11 K-Ras and Hmga2	23 Hoxa9	24 and Cdkn1a (p21)	25 also appeared to be regulated by Dicer1 in GMPs (supplemental Table 3). In agreement with data shown in Figure 4B-C	 only 11 transcripts (3%) were very sensitive to Dicer1 deletion	 because Dicer1 heterozygosity had a significant effect on their transcript levels (supplemental Table 3). Predicted targets of 20 miRNA families were significantly enriched in the fraction of messages that were up-regulated in Dicer1Î”/Î” cells compared with the fraction of nonregulated targets (Table 1; FDR-corrected P < .05 by Fisher exact test). Of the 300 genes that were de-repressed by Dicer1 depletion	 81 (> 25%) could be linked to signatures of HSCs	 MPPs	 and early erythropoiesis26 (supplemental Table 4). These findings imply that certain miRNA families control the switch of a cellular program for self-renewal and expansion toward a granulocyte/monocyte/macrophage differentiation program at the GMP stage.  View inlineView popup Table 1 Active miRNA families in GMPs Discussion  The results of the present study show that Cebpa-Creâ€“driven Dicer1 deletion in myeloid-committed progenitors	 and as a result depletion of miRNAs	 disrupts the differentiation program of GMPs that is required for normal myeloid development. This has been demonstrated in 3 ways. First	 normal numbers of Dicer1-null	 EYFP+ myeloid-committed progenitors were detected by flow cytometry	 indicating that depletion of miRNAs was not detrimental for these cells. Second	 gene-expression profiling of Dicer1-null GMPs identified an altered gene expression landscape of GMPs	 including enhanced expression of a set of genes that is characteristic for HSCs	 MPPs	 and early erythropoiesis. These data imply a disordered differentiation program in Dicer1-null GMPs. Finally	 flow cytometric analysis of myeloid cells from different hematopoietic tissues in mice showed a developmental block of monocytes	 strong reduction of mature macrophages in the abdominal cavity	 depletion of myeloid cells in the spleen	 and the presence of dysplastic neutrophils in the BM.  Recently	 Raaijmakers et al reported that deletion of Dicer1 specifically in mouse osteoprogenitors disrupts normal hematopoiesis	 resulting in myelodysplastic syndrome and secondary leukemias in mice.13 In these experiments	 Dicer1 was not deleted in HSPCs or in the myelodysplastic cells	 indicating that the observed dysplasia was initiated by osteoprogenitor dysfunction.13 Complementary to those findings	 we demonstrate herein a myeloid progenitor cellâ€“intrinsic role for miRNA processing in myelopoiesis in a system that leaves the BM environment intact. Our results indicate that Dicer1 may play dual roles in the control of myelopoiesis	 both of which are essential for normal myelopoiesis.  Pelger-HuÃ«t is characterized by abnormal nuclear shape and chromatin organization in blood granulocytes.21 A genome-wide linkage scan identified the lamin B receptor (LBR)	 a member of the sterol reductase family located on the linked genomic region 1q41-43	 to be mutated in patients suffering from Pelger-HuÃ«t disease.27 These mutations result in decreased expression of LBR	 which is strongly correlated with hyposegmentation of the nucleus in neutrophils.27â€“28 In our model	 Dicer1-null neutrophils were hyposegmented	 but LBR expression remained unchanged in Dicer1-null GMPs. This result suggests that other	 as-yet-undefined mechanisms may be involved in the observed developmental abnormalities or that downstream LBR pathways are controlled by Dicer1 and may cause features of Pelger-HuÃ«t anomaly.  In contrast to our results in GMPs	 recently published data show that Dicer1 deletion in hematopoietic cells from different origins causes cell death due to derepression of mRNAs coding for proteins involved in the induction of apoptosis. For example	 Dicer1 ablation in HSCs depletes functional HSCs	 induces rapid apoptosis in HSPCs	 and results in total disruption of hematopoiesis.14 These deleterious effects of miRNA depletion in HSCs can be largely circumvented by the reintroduction of a single miRNA	 miR-125a	 which targets the proapoptotic protein BAK1.14 In addition	 Dicer1 ablation in early B-cell progenitors induces apoptosis at the pre-B cell state because of de-repression of the miR-17-92 proapoptotic target Bcl2L11 (also known as Bim) as the consequence of Dicer1 loss.11 Strikingly	 although Bcl2L11 is approximately 1.8-fold up-regulated in Dicer1-null GMPs (supplemental Table 3)	 this did not induce an increase in apoptosis. In T cells	 Dicer1 is also essential for cell viability	10	12	29 suggesting that Dicer1-dependent RNAs in HSCs and cells from lymphoid origin regulate cell survival	 which agrees with our data in myeloid-committed progenitors. In addition to the regulation of apoptosis	 Dicer1 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of activation	 migration	 lineage choice	 and differentiation of T cells.10	12	29 To our knowledge	 this is the first report describing an exclusive role for Dicer1 in the developmental switch of myeloid-committed progenitors toward mature neutrophils	 macrophages	 and myeloid DCs.  A limitation of the Dicer1-deletion models is the global depletion of miRNAs that presumably results in disruption of many cellular pathways simultaneously	 which hampers the analysis of individual miRNA functions. Our data showed that Cebpa-Creâ€“driven Dicer1 ablation in GMPs depleted 20 active miRNA families simultaneously	 resulting in de-repression of at least 300 potential miRNA targets in GMPs. Because some miRNAs regulate expression by translational inhibition without affecting mRNA stability to a detectable level	 the determined level of miRNA activity is most likely an underestimation. In addition	 transcripts can be regulated by multiple miRNAs	 and the action of miRNAs is dependent on both miRNA and target gene levels	 which complicates the functional analysis of single miRNAs in this model.30 Despite the limitations of our model	 a set of miRNA target genes in GMPs is normally exclusively expressed in HSCs and	 when derepressed due to Dicer1 deletion in GMPs	 might explain	 at least in part	 some of the phenotypic features of the Dicer1-null GMPs. For example	 HOXA9	 a confirmed target of miR-126	24 is up-regulated in Dicer1-null GMPs	 and forced expression in myeloid progenitors blocks differentiation and results in enhanced replating capacity.31 In addition	 the Let-7 target HMGA223 is strongly up-regulated by Dicer1 depletion in GMPs	 and overexpression or truncation of HMGA2 has been found in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.32 In addition	 the robust de-repression of the HSC-specific genes HMGA2 (8-fold) and HOXA9 (3-fold)	 instead of the moderate regulation shown for most miRNA targets	 suggests a miRNA-driven	 switch-like transition from stem cell fate toward differentiation	 as shown for miRNAs lin-4 and let-7 targeting the genes lin-14 and lin-41	 respectively	 in Caenorhabditis elegans.33 Therefore	 our data suggest that the inability to silence stem cell genes in myeloid-committed progenitors interferes with the switch of stemness toward a myeloid differentiation program. Although these findings suggest that some miRNAs function as myeloid progenitors	 an extensive miRNA add-back screen in Dicer1-null cells is needed to identify their specific role in the control of myeloid development	 and this one of the challenges in the field.  In conclusion	 this study has demonstrated that Dicer1 ablation by C/ebpa-Cre does not affect the numbers of HSCs	 CMPs	 and GMPs	 but results in defective GMPs	 which are unable to mature toward monocytes	 macrophages	 and myeloid DCs	 and leads instead to neutrophil dysplasia. We have identified a set of 20 highly active miRNA families in GMPs and provided evidence that Dicer1 controls a gene-expression program that is normally active in HSCs and MPPs and counteracts the expression of messages that are linked to early erythropoiesis. Our data uncover a Dicer1-controlled differentiation program in GMPs that is required for normal myelopoiesis. 																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
4	44||Tyrosine phosphorylation	 regulated by protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) and kinases (PTKs)	 is important in signaling pathways underlying tumorigenesis. A mutational analysis of the tyrosine phosphatase gene superfamily in human cancers identified 83 somatic mutations in six PTPs (PTPRF	 PTPRG	 PTPRT	 PTPN3	 PTPN13	 PTPN14)	 affecting 26% of colorectal cancers and a smaller fraction of lung	 breast	 and gastric cancers. Fifteen mutations were nonsense	 frameshift	 or splice-site alterations predicted to result in truncated proteins lacking phosphatase activity. Five missense mutations in the most commonly altered PTP (PTPRT) were biochemically examined and found to reduce phosphatase activity. Expression of wild-type but not a mutant PTPRT in human cancer cells inhibited cell growth. These observations suggest that the mutated tyrosine phosphatases are tumor suppressor genes	 regulating cellular pathways that may be amenable to therapeutic intervention. Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues is a central feature of many cellular signaling pathways	 including those affecting growth	 differentiation	 cell cycle regulation	 apoptosis	 and invasion (1	 2). This phosphorylation is coordinately controlled by protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and phosphatases (PTPs). Although a variety of PTK genes have been directly linked to tumorigenesis through somatic activating mutations (3â€“6)	 only a few PTP genes have been implicated in cancer (7â€“10). Moreover	 it is not known how many or how frequently members of the PTP gene family are altered in any particular cancer type. We have systematically addressed these issues by comprehensive mutational analysis of the PTP gene superfamily in colorectal tumors.  The PTP gene superfamily is composed of three main families: (i) the classical PTPs	 including the receptor PTPs (RPTPs) and the nonreceptor PTPs (NRPTPs); (ii) the dual specificity phosphatases (DSPs)	 which can dephosphorylate serine and threonine in addition to tyrosine residues; and (iii) the low molecular weight phosphatases (LMPs) (1). Using an approach similar to that described in a recent bioinformatic analysis of PTPs in the mouse genome (11)	 we employed a combination of Hidden Markov Models representing catalytic domains of members of the PTP superfamily to identify 53 classical PTPs (21 RPTPs and 32 NRPTPs)	 33 DSPs	 and one LMP in the human genome (12). This analysis revealed a set of genes representing all known human PTPs (13) as well as seven putative PTPs.  As an initial screen to evaluate whether these phosphatases are genetically altered in human cancer	 we analyzed the coding exons of all 87 members of this gene superfamily in 18 colorectal cancers. A total of 1375 exons from all annotated RPTPs	 NRPTPs	 DSPs	 and LMPs were extracted from genomic databases (12). These exons were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from cancer genomic DNA samples and directly sequenced with dye terminator chemistry (12). Whenever a presumptive mutation was identified	 we attempted to determine whether it was somatically acquired (i.e.	 tumor specific) by examining the sequence of the gene in genomic DNA from normal tissue of the relevant patient.  From the 3.3 Mb of sequence information obtained	 we identified six genes containing somatic mutations	 including three members of the RPTP subfamily (PTPRF	 PTPRG	 and PTPRT) and three members of the NRPTP subfamily (PTPN3	 PTPN13	 and PTPN14). These six genes were then further analyzed for mutations in another 157 colorectal cancers. Through this strategy	 we identified 77 mutations in the six genes	 in aggregate affecting 26% of the colorectal tumors analyzed (table S1 and Fig. 1). Examination of these six genes in seven other tumor types identified PTPRT mutations in two of 11 (18%) lung cancers and two of 12 gastric cancers (17%)	 and PTPRF mutations in one of 11 (9%) lung cancers and one of 11 (9%) breast cancers. No mutations were identified in 12 pancreatic cancers	 12 ovarian cancers	 12 medulloblastomas	 or 12 glioblastomas (table S1 and Fig. 1). In total	 83 nonsynonymous mutations were observed	 all of which were somatic in the cancers that could be assessed (12).    Download high-res image  Open in new tab  Download Powerpoint Fig. 1. Distribution of mutations in PTPRT	 PTPN13	 PTPN14	 PTPRG	 PTPRF	 and PTPN3.

Black stars indicate PTPRT mutants evaluated for phosphatase activity (Fig. 2)	 and the red star indicates PTPRT mutant evaluated for effects on cell proliferation (Fig. 3).  Fifteen of the 83 mutations were nonsense	 frameshift	 or splice-site alterations	 all of which were predicted to result in aberrant or truncated proteins. In 16 tumors both alleles of the phosphatase gene appeared to be mutated	 a characteristic often associated with tumor suppressor genes. The majority of tumors with PTP gene mutations also contained mutations in KRAS or BRAF	 and nine tumors contained alterations in previously reported tyrosine kinase genes (table S1). Thus	 the mutant phosphatases identified in this study are likely to operate through cellular pathways distinct from those associated with previously identified mutant kinases.  Analysis of mutations in tumors is complicated by the fact that mutations can arise either as functional alterations affecting key genes underlying the neoplastic process or as nonfunctional â€œpassengerâ€ changes. The multiple waves of clonal expansion and selection that occur throughout tumorigenesis lead to fixation of any mutation that had previously occurred in any predecessor cell	 regardless of whether the mutation was actually responsible for the clonal expansion. Two independent lines of evidence suggest that the sequence alterations we observed are functional. First	 the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations provides an indication of selection	 as synonymous alterations usually do not exert a growth advantage. There were no somatic synonymous mutations detected in the colorectal cancers analyzed	 resulting in a ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations of 77 to 0	 much higher than the expected 2:1 ratio for nonselected passenger mutations (P < 1 Ã— 10â€“6). Second	 the prevalence of mutations in the coding regions of the analyzed genes was âˆ¼19 per Mb of tumor DNA	 similar to the prevalence of functional somatic alterations observed in other gene families [e.g.	 the tyrosine kinome (6)] and significantly higher than the prevalence of nonfunctional alterations previously observed in the cancer genomes (âˆ¼1 per Mb	 P < 0.01) (14). These data support the idea that these mutations were the targets of selection during tumorigenesis.  The great majority of the nonsense and frameshift mutations (Fig. 1) would result in polypeptides devoid of C-terminal phosphatase catalytic domains	 thereby leading to inactivation of the phosphatase. To evaluate whether tumor-specific point mutations alter phosphatase activity	 we biochemically tested mutant versions of PTPRT	 the most frequently mutated PTP in the superfamily. Mutations in both intracellular PTP domains (D1 and D2) were evaluated. His-tagged versions of the catalytic region of wild-type PTPRT	 two D1 mutants (Q987K and N1128I)	 and three D2 mutants (R1212W	 R1346L	 and T1368M) were produced in bacteria and analyzed for phosphatase activity by using 6	8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (DiFMUP) as a substrate (Fig. 2) (12). All D1 and D2 mutants had reduced phosphatase activity compared with the wild-type protein (Fig. 2). The kinetic parameter Kcat was reduced in both D1 mutants	 while Km was increased in all three D2 mutants	 suggesting that mutations in the two domains may have different effects on enzymatic activity. Although it has been thought that the D2 domain is usually catalytically inactive (1)	 our results are consistent with recent studies that show that the D2 domain is important for phosphatase activity in some receptor phosphatases (15).

His-tagged versions of PTPRT protein segments comprising the two catalytic domains containing wild-type (WT) and tumor-specific mutant sequences were expressed in bacteria and purified using nickelaffinity chromatography. Equal amounts of WT and mutant proteins were used to evaluate enzyme kinetics. The rate of hydrolysis of substrate (DiFMUP) is plotted against increasing substrate concentration. Data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menton equation	 and the resulting kinetic parameters of WT and mutant proteins are indicated in (B).  These biochemical data on missense mutations	 coupled with the large number of truncating mutations	 suggested that PTPRT functions as a tumor suppressor gene. To determine whether PTPRT expression can inhibit tumor cell growth	 we transfected wild-type PTPRT into HCT116 colorectal cancer cells (12). An identical expression vector containing an R632X mutant of PTPRT was used for comparison. Wild-type PTPRT potently inhibited cell growth in this assay	 as seen by the substantial decrease in the number of neomycin-resistant colonies compared with the R632X mutant or with vector alone (Fig. 3	 A and B). Similar results with wild-type and mutant PTPRT were also observed in DLD1 colorectal cancer cells.    Download high-res image  Open in new tab  Download Powerpoint Fig. 3.

The photographs show colonies stained with crystal violet after 14 days of geneticin selection. (B) Number of resistant colonies (mean of two 25 cm2 flasks) for WT PTPRT	 mutant PTPRT	 and empty vector.  The combination of these genetic	 biochemical	 and cellular data suggest that PTPRT and the other identified phosphatases are likely to act as tumor suppressors. This is consistent with the function of other phosphatases implicated in tumorigenesis (7	8	 16) and with the general role of phosphatases in inhibiting various growth-promoting signaling pathways (2). The absence of biallelic mutations in a subset of the analyzed tumors suggests that some alterations may act in a dominant-negative fashion or may affect gene dosage	 mechanisms that have been previously involved in inactivation of other tumor suppressor genes (17	 18).  Little is known about the functional role of the tyrosine phosphatases discussed here. PTPN13 appears to be involved in apoptosis (19) and may be partly responsible for the antitumor effects of tamoxifen (20). Overexpression of PTPN3 inhibits growth of NIH/3T3 cells	 possibly through interaction with valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97) (21). PTPN14 and PTPRF are thought to play a role in cell adhesion by regulating tyrosine phosphorylation of adherens junction proteins (22	 23). Because increased phosphorylation of adherens junctions has been shown to increase cell motility and migration (22	 24)	 mutational inactivation of these genes may be an important step in cancer cell invasion and metastasis. PTPRG maps to chromosome 3p14.2	 a region frequently lost in lung	 renal	 and early-stage breast tumors	 and is thought to be a target of the translocation at 3p14 in familial renal cell carcinoma (25â€“27). However	 no point mutations in PTPRG (28) or any of the other genes identified here have been previously described in any cancer. PTPRT is expressed in the developing central nervous system and in the adult cerebellum (29) and had not been thought to play a role in the growth or differentiation of other tissues. We have found that PTPRT is expressed in a variety of human tissues	 including normal colon epithelium as well as cells derived from colorectal cancers (fig. S1).  Phosphatases affect signaling pathways that may be amenable to therapeutic intervention in cancer cells (2). Although reactivation of incapacitated phosphatases is likely to be pharmacologically challenging	 identification of the corresponding kinases that phosphorylate substrates normally regulated by the mutant phosphatases could provide novel therapeutic targets. Like the analysis of genetic alterations in tyrosine kinases (6)	 the present study suggests the possibility of individualized therapy based on the mutant phosphatases present in specific tumors. Conceivably	 this approach would have broad therapeutic use	 because more than 50% of colorectal tumors analyzed to date have alterations in at least one member of the tyrosine phosphatome or kinome. 																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							
1	45||The receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase T (PTPRT/PTPÏ) is the most frequently mutated tyrosine phosphatase in human cancer. PTPÏ mediates homophilic cell-cell aggregation. In its extracellular region	 PTPÏ has cell adhesion molecule-like motifs	 including a MAM domain	 an immunoglobulin domain and four fibronectin type III (FNIII) repeats. Tumor-derived mutations have been identified in all of these extracellular domains. Previously	 we determined that tumor-derived mutations in the MAM and immunoglobulin domains of PTPÏ reduce homophilic cell-cell aggregation. In this manuscript	 we describe experiments in which we evaluated the contribution of the FNIII repeats to PTPÏ-mediated cell-cell adhesion. Our results demonstrate that deletion of the FNIII repeats of PTPÏ result in defective cell-cell aggregation. Furthermore	 all of the tumor-derived mutations in the FNIII repeats of PTPÏ also disrupt cell-cell aggregation. These results further support the hypothesis that mutational inactivation of PTPÏ may lead to cancer progression by disrupting cell-cell adhesion.  Keywords: Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase	 PTPRT	 PTPÏ	 fibronectin type III repeat	 cell-cell aggregation	 cell-cell adhesion Go to: 1. Introduction Cancer progression and metastasis is in part influenced by changes in cell adhesion and tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) (Paschos et al. 2009; Wheelock et al. 2008)	 as well as tyrosine kinases and tyrosine phosphatases	 respectively (Freiss and Vignon 2004; Ostman et al. 2006). Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) comprise a family of proteins that have extracellular CAM domains coupled to cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatase domains	 and thus can impact cancer progression by regulating both cell adhesion and tyrosine phosphorylation (Brady-Kalnay 2001; Ostman et al. 2006).  The type IIB PTPÎ¼-like subfamily of RPTPs includes PTPÎ¼	 PTPÏ	 PTPÎº	 and PCP-2 (PTPÎ») (Aricescu et al. 2008; Brady-Kalnay 2001). The extracellular segment of the PTPÎ¼-like RPTPs contain motifs found in CAMs	 including a MAM domain	 an immunoglobulin (Ig) domain and four fibronectin type III (FNIII) repeats (Aricescu et al. 2008; Brady-Kalnay 2001; Ostman et al. 2006). PTPÎ¼ subfamily members bind homophilically (i.e. the â€œligandâ€ for PTPÎ¼ is an identical PTPÎ¼ molecule on an adjacent cell) (Brady-Kalnay et al. 1993; Cheng et al. 1997; Gebbink et al. 1993; Sap et al. 1994; Yu et al. 2008; Zondag et al. 1995). The Ig domain of PTPÎ¼ is responsible for promoting homophilic interactions (Brady-Kalnay and Tonks 1994)	 and proper cell surface localization (Del Vecchio and Tonks 2005). However	 both the MAM and Ig domains as well as the first two FNIII repeats are required for efficient cell-cell adhesion of PTPÎ¼ (Aricescu et al. 2006; Aricescu et al. 2007; Aricescu et al. 2008; Brady-Kalnay and Tonks 1994; Cismasiu et al. 2004; Zondag et al. 1995). PTPÏ and PTPÎº also mediate homophilic cell-cell adhesion (Sap et al. 1994; Yu et al. 2008). However	 PCP2 has not yet been demonstrated to mediate cell-cell adhesion or aggregation although in vitro binding studies indicate it can bind homophilically (Cheng et al. 1997).  All type IIB RPTPs are potential tumor suppressor genes (Burgoyne et al. 2009a; Flavell et al. 2008; McArdle et al. 2001; Yan et al. 2006). Notably	 PTPÏ is the most frequently mutated phosphatase gene in human cancers including colon	 lung	 skin and stomach cancers (Forbes et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2004). Defective adhesion mediated by PTPÏ may be at least one mechanism of cancer progression. In fact	 cancer derived mutations in the MAM and Ig domains of PTPÏ are defective in mediating cell-cell aggregation (Yu et al. 2008).  In addition to the tumor-derived mutations in the MAM and Ig domains of PTPÏ previously described (Wang et al. 2004; Yu et al. 2008)	 the majority of extracellular domain mutations are located in the FNIII repeats of PTPÏ (Wang et al. 2004). Given the importance of FNIII repeats in PTPÎ¼-mediated adhesion and aggregation (Aricescu et al. 2007)	 we tested the contribution of the FNIII repeats of PTPÏ to PTPÏ-mediated adhesion. We determined that deletion constructs where each of the extracellular domains of PTPÏ is removed	 including the FNIII repeats	 are defective in mediating cell-cell aggregation of Sf9 cells. Furthermore	 when we engineered the cancer-derived mutations in the FNIII repeats of these PTPÏ mutant proteins	 they also result in defective cell-cell aggregation. These results demonstrate the importance of the FNIII repeats in contributing to proper cell-cell adhesion and suggest that adhesion mediated by PTPÏ is likely important for the tumor suppressor activity of PTPÏ.

Materials and methods 2.1 Baculovirus generation  Baculoviruses were generated by transfecting cells with the BaculoGoldâ„¢ Linearized Baculovirus DNA (BD Biosciences	 San Diego	 CA) according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. The baculovirus for wild-type PTPÏ was previously described (Yu et al. 2008).  2.2 Sf9 cell culture  Insect Sf9 cells from (BD Biosciences) were maintained at 27Â°C in Graces Insect Medium (BD Biosciences). The medium was supplemented with 10% FBS from (Hyclone	 Logan	 UT) and Gentamicin (MP Biomedicals	 Solon	 OH). Viruses were added to Sf9 cell medium to induce the expression of proteins of interest. Cells were harvested 30 hours post-infection for further analysis.  2.3 Generation of PTPRT deletion constructs  The PTPÏ-Î”MAM	 PTPÏ-Î”Ig	 PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-1	 PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-2	 PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-3 and PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-4 constructs were generated by fusion PCR using the full-length PTPRT pVL1393-V5-His vector as the template. The primers 5â€™-GAAGATCTATGGCGAGCCTCGCCGCG-3â€™ and 5â€™-CCGGAATTCGGATCCTGGGGCGCTCTGAGCCCGGG-3â€™ were used to generate the PTPÏ-Î”MAM construct; the primers 5â€™-GCGTGGGAGGCTCTCTGCATGGATGAGCAAGGAC-3â€™ and 5â€™-CAATGGGTCTTGCTCATCCATGCAGAGAGCCTCCCACGCCCATTG-3â€™ were used to generate the PTPÏ-Î”Ig construct; the primers 5â€™-CTGCACACTTGGTCCTGGTTTTCACGATCAGCTCCGCGTA-3â€™ and 5â€™-TACGCGGAGCGTCGTGAAAACCAGGACCAAGTGTGCAG-3â€™ were used to generate the PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-1 construct; the primers 5â€™-CCGCCAGGGCCTCCCCTCACCGAGGAAGACGTTCCAGGAG-3â€™ and 5â€™-CTCCTGGAACGTCTTCCTCGGTGAGGGGAGGCCCTGGCGG-3â€™ were used to generate the PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-2 construct; the primers 5â€™-GAGGAGCTGGTGGTGCAGACTAAAATTTCAGCTCCATCCA-3â€™ and 5â€™-TGGATGGAGCTGAAATTTTAGTCTGCACCACCAGCTCCTC-3â€™ were used to generate the PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-3 construct and the 5â€™-GTCACCACTCGGATTGCCACCGGTGCCTCCACCCAGAATT-3â€™ and 5â€™-AATTCTGGGTGGAGGCACCGGTGGCAATCCGAGTGGTGAC-3â€™ were used to generate the PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-4 construct.  2.4 Immunoblotting  Sf9 cells were lysed in a standard lysis buffer (20 mM TrisÂ·HCl	 pH 7.5	 1% Triton X-100	 150 mM sodium chloride	 2 mM Benzamidine	 2.5Î¼g/ml Aprotinin	 2.5Î¼g/ml Leupeptin	 and 0.5Î¼g/ml Pepstatin). Samples were solubilized in 2X SDS loading buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Samples were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman	 Piscataway	 NJ) and immunoblotted with SK18 (Brady-Kalnay et al. 1993)	 which cross-reacts with PTPÏ.  2.5 Cell surface expression of PTPÏ  Cell surface expression of PTPÏ protein in baculovirus infected Sf9 cells was determined using a modified biotin-avidin reaction with the Cell Surface Protein Isolation Kit (catalog# 89991	 Pierce	 Rockford	 IL)	 as previously described (Yu et al. 2008). Briefly	 Sf9 cell media was removed and the flasks were incubated with rocking for 30 minutes at 4Â°C in 5ml of 0.25mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin in 1X PBS. The cells were mechanically removed from the flask	 centrifuged	 washed	 and lysed according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocols. To isolate cell surface expressed PTPÏ the cell lysate was added to a NeutrAvidin Gel column and incubated for 60 min at room temperature (RT) with rocking prior to washing and eluting proteins with 200Î¼l of sample buffer containing a final concentration of 55mM DTT for 60min at RT. The flow through was run on 6% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Total cell surface protein levels were normalized by immunoblotting cell lysates with an anti-actin antibody (JLA20). The normalized cell surface protein was run on 6% SDS-PAGE gels	 transferred to nitrocellulose and immunoblotted with antibodies to PTPÎ¼ that also recognized PTPÏ (SK18) followed by secondary antibody conjugated to HRP. The HRP signal was detected using a Fluor-S MAX MultiImager (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.	 Hercules	 CA).  2.6 Aggregation Assays  Sf9 cells were harvested by trituration. The cell suspensions were added to glass scintillation vials and incubated at 27Â°C at 90 rpm in a gyratory shaker for 30 minutes. For a given condition	 the cell suspension was transferred to a 100mm petri dish either prior to (0 time point) or 30 minutes after aggregation. Images were captured at 10X magnification with a Nikon TE-200 inverted fluorescent microscope (Tokyo	 Japan). To quantify cell aggregates	 pictures of four randomly selected fields were taken per dish. The area of each object (single cells and aggregates) was determined by the Metamorph software (Molecular Devices) using an auto-threshold setting for light objects and appropriate size filters that allowed the counting of cells and aggregates but not debris. The four replicates were combined to yield average readings per condition. The percent aggregation was then calculated as the average aggregate area at 30 minutes minus the average aggregate area at zero minutes divided by the average aggregate area at 30 minutes [(N30-N0)/N30].

Mutations probed in this study were mapped using this sequence alignment onto the PTPÎ¼ structure (PDB ID: 2V5Y). The figure was prepared utilizing PyMOL 1.2r1 (http://pymol.org).  Go to: 3. Results 3.1 Deletions in the MAM	 Ig	 and FNIII repeat domains of PTPÏ result in defective cell-cell aggregation  To test whether a protein mediates cell-cell aggregation or adhesion	 one has to express the protein of interest in the non-adhesive cells. Otherwise	 one cannot measure the aggregation or adhesion of a single molecule in the sea of other adhesion molecules naturally expressed in adhesive cells. This is the main reason that the non-adhesive Sf9 or Drosophila S2 cells are widely used models for such studies. To our knowledge	 nearly all cell lines of epithelial origin are adhesive cells and thus are not suitable for these studies. Introduction of putative adhesion molecules into non-adhesive Drosophila S2 insect cells has been used to demonstrate adhesive functions for fasciclin II	 connectin	 Dtrk	 ARK	 Neuroglian	 and Capricious molecules directly (Bellosta et al. 1995; Hortsch et al. 1995; Nose et al. 1992; Pulido et al. 1992; Shinza-Kameda et al. 2006; Snow et al. 1989). In a similar approach	 we and others demonstrated that the full-length form of PTPÎ¼ induced aggregation	 via a homophilic binding mechanism	 when expressed in nonadhesive Sf9 insect cells	 which are derived from the Fall army-worm Spodoptera frugiperda (Brady-Kalnay et al. 1993; Gebbink et al. 1993; Zondag et al. 1995). We have also used this system for analyzing PTPRT/PTP rho (Yu et al.	 2008). Examples of other cell adhesion molecules that have been studied in Sf9 cells include L1 (Gouveia et al. 2008)	 Galectin-3 (Inohara and Raz 1995) and C-CAM1 (Phan et al. 2001). Insect S2 and Sf9 cells are extremely useful systems to analyze adhesive mechanisms of cell adhesion molecules.  The MAM domain	 Ig domain	 and first two-FNIII repeats are essential for PTPÎ¼ cell-cell aggregation (Brady-Kalnay and Tonks 1994; Zondag et al. 1995). To test whether these domains are the minimal essential regions required for PTPÏ cell-cell aggregation	 baculoviral PTPÏ deletion constructs of the MAM domain	 Ig domain	 and each of the four individual FNIII repeats were made and expressed in non-adhesive Sf9 insect cells (Figure 1). All the PTPÏ deletion constructs were expressed and appropriately trafficked to the cell surface (Figure 1). To test whether these domains contribute to PTPÏ-dependent adhesion	 Sf9 cells were evaluated for their ability to mediate cell-cell aggregation when expressing the deletion constructs. Aggregation assays with Sf9 cells expressing the deletion constructs were conducted alongside aggregation assays using Sf9 cells expressing wild-type PTPÏ	 which mediates cell-cell aggregation (Figure 2) and serves as a positive control (Yu et al. 2008). Deletion of any of the extracellular domains of PTPÏ resulted in defective cell-cell aggregation compared to aggregation of wild-type PTPÏ expressing Sf9 cells (Figure 2). Deletion of the fourth FNIII repeat was the least severe where ~23% aggregation was observed. Deletion of the MAM domain	 Ig domain and FNIII repeats 1	 2 or 3 resulted in 5â€“16% aggregation. When the level of aggregation was quantified	 we determined that all of the deletion constructs resulted in a large and statistically significant reduction in cell-cell aggregation (Figure 2	 p-value<0.005). Together with our previous study	 these results demonstrate that all of the extracellular domains of PTPÏ are necessary for PTPÏ-mediated cell-cell aggregation.  Figure 1 Figure 1 PTPÏ deletion constructs are all expressed at the cell surface. Constructs containing deletions of one extracellular domain of PTPÏ each were generated and expressed in Sf9 cells. Total cellular protein and cell surface protein were isolated ... Figure 2 Figure 2 Deletion of any of the extracellular domains of PTPÏ disrupts cell-cell aggregation. Sf9 cells expressing deletion constructs of the individual extracellular domains of PTPÏ were allowed to aggregate for 30 minutes prior to imaging. Scale ... 3.2 Tumor-Derived PTPÏ Mutations in the FNIII repeats result in defective cell-cell aggregation  We next tested the effects of human tumor-derived mutations in the FNIII repeats of PTPÏ on PTPÏ-mediated cell-cell aggregation. We recently demonstrated that tumor-derived mutations in the MAM and Ig domains of PTPÏ are defective in cell-cell aggregation using the Sf9 aggregation assay (Yu et al. 2008)	 and given the above results	 we hypothesized that mutations in the FNIII domains would likewise result in defective aggregation. Ten human tumor-derived mutations are located in the second	 third and fourth FNIII repeats of PTPÏ (Wang et al. 2004). To test whether these mutations also affect cell-cell aggregation	 we engineered the ten human mutations by site-directed mutagenesis using the full-length PTPÏ baculoviral construct as a template (see Figure 3). The ten mutations are expressed in Sf9 cells at the expected molecular weight and at similar levels to full-length human PTPÏ (Figure 3). All of these mutants are expressed at the cell surface (Figure 3). When these mutant PTPÏ proteins were expressed in Sf9 cells and tested in aggregation assays	 we observed that all of the mutant PTPÏ proteins resulted in fewer and smaller aggregates than wild type PTPÏ (Figure 4). When the level of aggregation was quantified	 we determined that all of the FNIII mutations significantly reduced cell-cell aggregation (16â€“43%) compared to cells expressing wild type PTPÏ (68% aggregation	 p-value<0.008	 Figure 4).  Figure 3 Figure 3 PTPÏ proteins containing tumor-derived mutations in their FNIII domains are expressed at the cell surface. Ten mutations in the FNIII domains of PTPÏ were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in Sf9 cells. Total cellular ...

Discussion PTPRT/PTPÏ is the most highly mutated tyrosine phosphatase in human colon carcinomas. We and others found that PTPRT/ PTPÏ is also mutated in lung	 gastric and skin (melanoma) cancers (Forbes et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2004). The spectrum of mutations	 which included nonsense mutations and frameshifts	 suggested that these mutations were inactivating (Wang et al. 2004). Biochemical analyses demonstrated that missense mutations in the catalytic domains of PTPRT diminished its phosphatase activity and overexpression of PTPRT inhibited colon cancer cell growth. Moreover	 we showed previously that the tumor-derived mutations in the MAM and Ig domains of PTPÏ are defective in cell-cell adhesion (Yu et al. 2008). All these data suggest that PTPRT/PTPÏ normally functions as a tumor suppressor gene. The experiments presented in this manuscript evaluate the contribution of the individual extracellular domains of PTPÏ to PTPÏ-mediated adhesion. We demonstrate that in addition to the MAM and Ig domains	 the FNIII repeats are required for PTPÏ-mediated adhesion. Importantly	 we also show that PTPÏ-mediated adhesion is impaired by human tumor-derived mutations in those FNIII repeats. These studies indicate that all the tumor-derived mutations located in the extracellular domain of PTPRT are loss-of-function mutations	 thereby providing further evidence that PTPRT is a tumor suppressor. This notion is further supported by our recent study showing that PTPRT knockout mice are highly susceptible to colon specific carcinogen azoxymethane (AOM)-induced colon cancer (Zhao et al.).  PTPÎ¼-mediated cell-cell aggregation requires the MAM domain	 Ig domain	 and the first two FNIII repeats (Aricescu et al. 2006; Aricescu et al. 2007; Brady-Kalnay and Tonks 1994; Cismasiu et al. 2004; Zondag et al. 1995). The entire extracellular domain of PTPÎ¼ is predicted to make a rigid conformation with extensive interfaces between each of the domains (Aricescu et al. 2006). The minimal adhesive unit for functional cell-cell aggregation is the MAM domain	 Ig domain and the first two FNIII repeats (Aricescu et al. 2006; Brady-Kalnay and Tonks 1994; Zondag et al. 1995). However	 the FNIII repeats appear to play a role in spacing the key homophilic interaction domain(s) a certain distance from the plasma membrane. Deletion of the FNIII repeats changed the intercellular spacing of two apposing membranes (Aricescu et al. 2007). Cell-cell aggregation assays of the FNIII deletion constructs were not performed in that study (Aricescu et al. 2007). The amino acid residues of the interfaces between the extracellular domains are highly conserved between members of the type IIB RPTP subfamily (Aricescu et al. 2006; Aricescu et al. 2007) therefore it is likely that the PTPÏ adhesive interface resembles that of PTPÎ¼. Together our data support the hypothesis that the essential regions for PTPÏ-mediated adhesion resemble those of PTPÎ¼.  To gain insight into how the point mutations may alter the adhesive function of PTPÏ	 we modeled the human tumor derived PTPÏ mutations onto the crystal structure of PTPÎ¼ (Figure 5). The crystal structure of PTPÎ¼ includes only the first three FNIII repeats (Aricescu et al. 2007). Four of these mutations fall within the second FNIII (FNIII-2) repeat (I395V	 Y412F	 R453C	 Q479E). It is important to note that FNIII-2 is required for efficient cell-cell adhesion (Aricescu et al. 2006). Two of the mutations fall in the third FNIII (FNIII-3) repeat (S492F	 N510K). The mutation within the linker region between FNIII-1 and FNII-2 (Y412F) could alter the flexibility or positioning between the two domains. The other mutations (I395V R453C	 Q479E	 S492F	 N510K) appear to be clustered in surface exposed regions and/or near the linker regions between FNIII-2 and FNIII-3 that could alter flexibility	 position of individual FNIII repeats and/or protein-protein interactions. While these mutations do not correspond to the adhesive interface hypothesized for PTPÎ¼ based upon a single static crystal structure (Aricescu et al. 2007)	 some of the mutations fall within the FNIII-2 repeat which is required for adhesion	 and all of these surface modifications would likely alter either the three-dimensional topology and/or cis/trans interactions of PTPÏ.  Figure 5 Figure 5 Structural modeling of the point mutations of PTPÏ. The point mutations (indicated in red) evaluated in this manuscript were modeled onto the equivalent sites in the crystal structure of PTPÎ¼. The PTPÏ mutations likely alter cell-cell ... Other type IIB RPTPs also function as tumor suppressor genes	 by regulating adhesion and/or tyrosine phosphorylation of effector proteins. Expression of PTPÎ¼ is reduced in human glioblastomas (GBM) and cell lines (Burgoyne et al. 2009a). Reduction in full-length PTPÎ¼ expression with a concomitant increase in a proteolytically processed cytoplasmic fragment of PTPÎ¼ is observed in GBM cells and both are correlated with decreased adhesion and increased migration observed in the disease (Burgoyne et al. 2009a; Burgoyne et al. 2009b). Over-expression of the full-length form of PTPÎ¼ suppressed migration of GBM cells and reduces their survival (Burgoyne et al. 2009b). Of note	 at the same time that stable cell adhesion is reduced due to the loss of full-length PTPÎ¼ expression in GBM cells	 a catalytically active cytoplasmic fragment of PTPÎ¼ is released and translocates to the nucleus (Burgoyne et al. 2009b). Catalytic activity of this fragment is also necessary for cell migration and viability of GBM cells (Burgoyne et al. 2009b). Therefore	 both the tyrosine phosphatase activity of the cytoplasmic fragment of PTPÎ¼ and the loss of PTPÎ¼-mediated adhesion may contribute to the invasiveness of GBM cells.  PTPÎº is also implicated in tumor progression. PTPÎº expression is reduced in melanoma cell lines and human tissue biopsies (McArdle et al. 2001)	 and in Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma cells (Flavell et al. 2008). Over-expression of PTPÎº in Hodgkin lymphoma cells reduces cellular proliferation and survival (Flavell et al. 2008). Like PTPÎ¼	 PTPÎº is proteolytically processed (Anders et al. 2006)	 potentially as a result of aberrant glycosylation (Kim et al. 2006). It is not clear whether adhesion or catalytic activity of PTPÎº is required for its tumor suppressor activity (Flavell et al. 2008; Kim et al. 2006). Of note	 the cleaved cytoplasmic domain fragment of PTPÎº is catalytically active	 translocates to the nucleus and promotes Î²-catenin-mediated transcription (Anders et al. 2006). Signaling via the PTPÎº cytoplasmic fragment might augment the loss of stable cell-cell adhesion and may promote tumor progression.  Although speculative	 it is interesting to postulate that tyrosine phosphatase activity and or cleavage of PTPÏ will also be an important element of its tumor suppressor activity	 as has been demonstrated for PTPÎ¼ and PTPÎº. Interestingly	 we identified and validated STAT3 as a direct substrate of PTPRT (Zhang et al. 2007). STAT3 is latent transcription factor that translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus after being phosphorylated at the Y705 residue. It is possible that the cleaved intracellular fragment of PTPÏ	 which contains the phosphatase domains	 translocates to nucleus and dephosphorylates STAT3. Besco and colleagues found that PTPRT associates with the adhesion molecule E-cadherin and its binding partner p120 catenin	 which are PTPRT substrates (Besco et al. 2006). p120 also translocates to the nucleus and associates with the Kaiso transcription factor (Daniel and Reynolds 1999). Given the frequency and distribution of mutations in PTPRT/PTPÏ in human colon and other cancers	 a more thorough understanding of its biological function is warranted. 																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
4	46||Introduction  Preceding hematologic disorders are documented in one-quarter of adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).1 However	 an unknown proportion of AMLs that apparently arise de novo may have developed from undiscovered abnormal hematopoiesis.  Mutations in CBL	 encoding an E3 ubiquitin ligase	 are found in 10% to 20% of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) or juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) patients.2â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“-7 Germline CBL mutations cause the CBL syndrome that recapitulates features of other RAS-MAPK pathway disorders and predisposes to JMML.8â‡“-10 In AML	 CBL mutations are rare but associated with inv(16).11â‡“â‡“-14  Here we describe the development of AML in an adult with CBL syndrome and JMML-typical loss of wild-type (WT) CBL in bone marrow.  Methods  Written informed consent of the patient included in the present study was obtained for sample storage and analyses before sampling	 as approved by the local ethics committee. This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Karyotype; mutations in NPM1	 FLT3 (tyrosine kinase domain	 internal tandem duplication)	 CEBPA	 and CBL; and CBFB-MYH11 expression relative to ABL1 were assessed as described elsewhere.15â‡“â‡“-18 CBL mutated-to-WT allelic ratios were determined using the PyroMark Q96MD (Qiagen)	 and chromosomal copy numbers using CytoScanHD arrays (Affymetrix). Data were deposited at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/ (E-MEXP-3997). Whole-exome sequencing was performed as reported19; variants were validated by Sanger sequencing. Methods are detailed in the supplemental data available on the Blood Web site.  Results and discussion  Characteristics of the AML  A 40-year-old man was diagnosed with AML in June 2011. His preexisting conditions were hereditary spherocytosis (diagnosed in 1996)	 coagulopathy (low FVII	 X	 XII	 XIII)	 atrial fibrillation	 and hypocholesterolemia; a splenomegaly was considered a consequence of the spherocytosis. At AML diagnosis	 his white blood cell count was 19â€‰390/ÂµL	 with approximately 30% blasts and 30% dysplastic monocytes (supplemental Figure 1). The marrow contained 50% CD117+ blasts and 30% CD14+ monocytes; the karyotype was 46	XY	add(4)(q?31)	inv(16)(p13q22)[21]/46	XY	inv(16)(p13q22)[1]. CBFB-MYH11 (type D) was detected with a ratio of 46.23 in blood. NPM1	 CEBPA	 and FLT3 mutations were absent.  The patient received â€œ3+7â€ induction followed by dasatinib (clinicaltrials.gov #NCT00850382). Six weeks after the start of therapy	 complete remission (CR) was documented. The patient received 4 consolidation courses with high-dose cytarabine. At last follow-up (September 2013)	 he was in continuous CR	 with no CBFB-MYH11 detectable.  Identification of a germline CBL mutation  Between the treatment courses	 the patientâ€™s monocyte counts rose to extraordinarily high levels. Although monocytes were within normal limits after treatment and in blood counts dating back to 1996 (supplemental Table 1)	 this observation prompted the question of whether the patient had an underlying monocytic disorder.  Because monocytosis is a hallmark of JMML and CMML	 we examined the mutation status of CBL exons 8 and 9 in blood collected at the AML diagnosis. We indeed found a p.D390V-mutation	 located in the frequently mutated RING finger domain. Assessing the germline origin of the mutation	 we also identified it in buccal mucosa and hair follicles. We concluded that the patient had a previously undiagnosed CBL syndrome	 with the preexisting coagulopathy and atrial fibrillation being part of the phenotype (supplemental Table 2).8â‡“-10  No CBL mutations were detected in the blood of both of his parents	 indicating de novo occurrence in the patientâ€™s germline. The patient has no siblings.  Zygosity of the CBL mutation  Copy numberâ€“neutral loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) of the CBL-containing chromosomal band 11q23.3 is common in children with CBL syndrome and JMML.8	10 11q-LOH was also detectable in marrow mononuclear cells from our patient during AML. Moreover	 the 11q-LOH persisted in B lymphocytes	 granulocytes	 and monocytes collected later during CR (Table 1 and supplemental Figure 2). This is reminiscent of the situation in children with CBL syndrome and JMML whose myeloproliferation spontaneously improves.8 Notably	 the AML in our patient exhibited an additional gain of 11q material	 indicating that the LOH had existed before the AML. In skin and T lymphocytes	 11q retained heterozygosity.  View inlineView popup Table 1 Chromosome 11q aberrations assessed by single nucleotide polymorphism array and CBL D390V allele burden determined by sequencing in different cell populations To complement the LOH findings	 we determined the allelic burden of the CBL mutation by pyrosequencing (Table 1). In agreement with the LOH data	 the mutation was heterozygous in skin and T lymphocytes but homozygous in AML cells and in granulocytes	 monocytes	 and B lymphocytes collected during CR	 where it remained homozygous until last follow-up	 underlining the stability of the genetically aberrant hematopoiesis. Notably	 LOH and pyrosequencing data suggested the presence of a small fraction of T lymphocytes also harboring the 11q-LOH (Table 1 and supplemental Figure 2).  Identification of cooperating mutations by whole-exome sequencing  Similar to our patient	 children with CBL syndrome and transient JMML feature normal blood counts and persistent homozygous CBL mutation in their hematopoiesis.8 Little is known about mechanisms that could be responsible for normal hematopoiesis despite oncogenic features characteristic of JMML. We wondered whether this was associated with the acquisition of mutations that overcome the myeloproliferative impact of the homozygous CBL mutation. We therefore subjected granulocytes from CR and skin to whole-exome sequencing but identified no additional mutations.  We also performed whole-exome sequencing of AML cells to identify mutations that were acquired during AML development	 in addition to inv(16) and 11q-gain. We detected somatic mutations in 12 genes (Table 2)	 three of which (CAND1	 NID2	 PTPRT) were previously found mutated in AML.20â‡“-22 However	 no gene has an established role in leukemogenesis (eg	 as cooperating partner of mutant CBL or CBFB-MYH11).  View inlineView popup Table 2 Gene mutations in AML acquired in addition to the germline CBL mutation and the chromosomal aberrations Biological impact of the CBL mutation  JMML features the formation of colonies at low concentrations of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF).23 We observed no spontaneous growth or hypersensitivity to GM-CSF of mononuclear cells collected from our patient during CR (data not shown)	 which underlines the lacking or only subtle impact of the homozygous CBL mutation on hematopoiesis. Moreover	 granulocytes showed normal production of reactive oxygen species and interleukin-8 to stimuli	 and adhesion and migration/chemotaxis were normal (data not shown).  In summary	 we diagnosed a CBL syndrome in an adult	 who	 as observed in children with CBL syndrome developing JMML	8	10 had lost the CBL WT allele in the bone marrow. Whether this leads to overt JMML only under certain circumstances is not well understood.24 Because the LOH persisted in the various hematopoietic cell lineages in our patient	 it likely conferred a clonal advantage at one point. Thus	 the patient may have indeed gone through a JMML or related hematologic disorder during infancy	 which spontaneously resolved. However	 medical information to support this assumption is unavailable. Following the hypothesis that normal blood counts in our patient could be associated with the acquisition of mutations counterbalancing the mutant CBL	 we performed whole-exome sequencing but identified no acquired mutations. On the background of the CBL mutation	 the patient developed AML through the acquisition of inv(16)	 gain of 11q-material	 and at least 12 gene mutations. The AML was eradicated by chemotherapy	 leaving a hematopoiesis with homozygous CBL mutation.  Although the CBL syndrome is known to predispose to JMML	 this is the first description of a different myeloid neoplasia occurring at adult age. It cannot be determined whether the AML was mere coincidence or caused by a predisposition conferred by the CBL mutation. However	 the latter is supported by the specific gain of CBL-encoding 11q-material	 and occurrence of inv(16)	 which associates with CBL mutations.11â‡“â‡“-14 If substantiated by future studies	 the association between CBL syndrome and AML should be considered in clinical practice. CBL would then join other genes (eg	 RUNX1 or CEBPA) with germline mutations that were linked to a predisposition to AML.25  Overall	 the case highlights the possibility of genetically aberrant hematopoiesis despite normal blood counts and provides insight into myeloid neoplasias in the CBL syndrome. Because of potential health problems associated with a CBL syndrome	 germline analyses may be generally warranted in younger adults with CBL-mutated neoplasias. 																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													
1	47||The receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase T (PTPRT/PTPÏ) is the most frequently mutated tyrosine phosphatase in human cancer. PTPÏ mediates homophilic cell-cell aggregation. In its extracellular region	 PTPÏ has cell adhesion molecule-like motifs	 including a MAM domain	 an immunoglobulin domain and four fibronectin type III (FNIII) repeats. Tumor-derived mutations have been identified in all of these extracellular domains. Previously	 we determined that tumor-derived mutations in the MAM and immunoglobulin domains of PTPÏ reduce homophilic cell-cell aggregation. In this manuscript	 we describe experiments in which we evaluated the contribution of the FNIII repeats to PTPÏ-mediated cell-cell adhesion. Our results demonstrate that deletion of the FNIII repeats of PTPÏ result in defective cell-cell aggregation. Furthermore	 all of the tumor-derived mutations in the FNIII repeats of PTPÏ also disrupt cell-cell aggregation. These results further support the hypothesis that mutational inactivation of PTPÏ may lead to cancer progression by disrupting cell-cell adhesion.  Keywords: Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase	 PTPRT	 PTPÏ	 fibronectin type III repeat	 cell-cell aggregation	 cell-cell adhesion Go to: 1. Introduction Cancer progression and metastasis is in part influenced by changes in cell adhesion and tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) (Paschos et al. 2009; Wheelock et al. 2008)	 as well as tyrosine kinases and tyrosine phosphatases	 respectively (Freiss and Vignon 2004; Ostman et al. 2006). Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) comprise a family of proteins that have extracellular CAM domains coupled to cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatase domains	 and thus can impact cancer progression by regulating both cell adhesion and tyrosine phosphorylation (Brady-Kalnay 2001; Ostman et al. 2006).  The type IIB PTPÎ¼-like subfamily of RPTPs includes PTPÎ¼	 PTPÏ	 PTPÎº	 and PCP-2 (PTPÎ») (Aricescu et al. 2008; Brady-Kalnay 2001). The extracellular segment of the PTPÎ¼-like RPTPs contain motifs found in CAMs	 including a MAM domain	 an immunoglobulin (Ig) domain and four fibronectin type III (FNIII) repeats (Aricescu et al. 2008; Brady-Kalnay 2001; Ostman et al. 2006). PTPÎ¼ subfamily members bind homophilically (i.e. the â€œligandâ€ for PTPÎ¼ is an identical PTPÎ¼ molecule on an adjacent cell) (Brady-Kalnay et al. 1993; Cheng et al. 1997; Gebbink et al. 1993; Sap et al. 1994; Yu et al. 2008; Zondag et al. 1995). The Ig domain of PTPÎ¼ is responsible for promoting homophilic interactions (Brady-Kalnay and Tonks 1994)	 and proper cell surface localization (Del Vecchio and Tonks 2005). However	 both the MAM and Ig domains as well as the first two FNIII repeats are required for efficient cell-cell adhesion of PTPÎ¼ (Aricescu et al. 2006; Aricescu et al. 2007; Aricescu et al. 2008; Brady-Kalnay and Tonks 1994; Cismasiu et al. 2004; Zondag et al. 1995). PTPÏ and PTPÎº also mediate homophilic cell-cell adhesion (Sap et al. 1994; Yu et al. 2008). However	 PCP2 has not yet been demonstrated to mediate cell-cell adhesion or aggregation although in vitro binding studies indicate it can bind homophilically (Cheng et al. 1997).  All type IIB RPTPs are potential tumor suppressor genes (Burgoyne et al. 2009a; Flavell et al. 2008; McArdle et al. 2001; Yan et al. 2006). Notably	 PTPÏ is the most frequently mutated phosphatase gene in human cancers including colon	 lung	 skin and stomach cancers (Forbes et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2004). Defective adhesion mediated by PTPÏ may be at least one mechanism of cancer progression. In fact	 cancer derived mutations in the MAM and Ig domains of PTPÏ are defective in mediating cell-cell aggregation (Yu et al. 2008).  In addition to the tumor-derived mutations in the MAM and Ig domains of PTPÏ previously described (Wang et al. 2004; Yu et al. 2008)	 the majority of extracellular domain mutations are located in the FNIII repeats of PTPÏ (Wang et al. 2004). Given the importance of FNIII repeats in PTPÎ¼-mediated adhesion and aggregation (Aricescu et al. 2007)	 we tested the contribution of the FNIII repeats of PTPÏ to PTPÏ-mediated adhesion. We determined that deletion constructs where each of the extracellular domains of PTPÏ is removed	 including the FNIII repeats	 are defective in mediating cell-cell aggregation of Sf9 cells. Furthermore	 when we engineered the cancer-derived mutations in the FNIII repeats of these PTPÏ mutant proteins	 they also result in defective cell-cell aggregation. These results demonstrate the importance of the FNIII repeats in contributing to proper cell-cell adhesion and suggest that adhesion mediated by PTPÏ is likely important for the tumor suppressor activity of PTPÏ.

The baculovirus for wild-type PTPÏ was previously described (Yu et al. 2008).  2.2 Sf9 cell culture  Insect Sf9 cells from (BD Biosciences) were maintained at 27Â°C in Graces Insect Medium (BD Biosciences). The medium was supplemented with 10% FBS from (Hyclone	 Logan	 UT) and Gentamicin (MP Biomedicals	 Solon	 OH). Viruses were added to Sf9 cell medium to induce the expression of proteins of interest. Cells were harvested 30 hours post-infection for further analysis.  2.3 Generation of PTPRT deletion constructs  The PTPÏ-Î”MAM	 PTPÏ-Î”Ig	 PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-1	 PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-2	 PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-3 and PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-4 constructs were generated by fusion PCR using the full-length PTPRT pVL1393-V5-His vector as the template. The primers 5â€™-GAAGATCTATGGCGAGCCTCGCCGCG-3â€™ and 5â€™-CCGGAATTCGGATCCTGGGGCGCTCTGAGCCCGGG-3â€™ were used to generate the PTPÏ-Î”MAM construct; the primers 5â€™-GCGTGGGAGGCTCTCTGCATGGATGAGCAAGGAC-3â€™ and 5â€™-CAATGGGTCTTGCTCATCCATGCAGAGAGCCTCCCACGCCCATTG-3â€™ were used to generate the PTPÏ-Î”Ig construct; the primers 5â€™-CTGCACACTTGGTCCTGGTTTTCACGATCAGCTCCGCGTA-3â€™ and 5â€™-TACGCGGAGCGTCGTGAAAACCAGGACCAAGTGTGCAG-3â€™ were used to generate the PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-1 construct; the primers 5â€™-CCGCCAGGGCCTCCCCTCACCGAGGAAGACGTTCCAGGAG-3â€™ and 5â€™-CTCCTGGAACGTCTTCCTCGGTGAGGGGAGGCCCTGGCGG-3â€™ were used to generate the PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-2 construct; the primers 5â€™-GAGGAGCTGGTGGTGCAGACTAAAATTTCAGCTCCATCCA-3â€™ and 5â€™-TGGATGGAGCTGAAATTTTAGTCTGCACCACCAGCTCCTC-3â€™ were used to generate the PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-3 construct and the 5â€™-GTCACCACTCGGATTGCCACCGGTGCCTCCACCCAGAATT-3â€™ and 5â€™-AATTCTGGGTGGAGGCACCGGTGGCAATCCGAGTGGTGAC-3â€™ were used to generate the PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-4 construct.  2.4 Immunoblotting  Sf9 cells were lysed in a standard lysis buffer (20 mM TrisÂ·HCl	 pH 7.5	 1% Triton X-100	 150 mM sodium chloride	 2 mM Benzamidine	 2.5Î¼g/ml Aprotinin	 2.5Î¼g/ml Leupeptin	 and 0.5Î¼g/ml Pepstatin). Samples were solubilized in 2X SDS loading buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Samples were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman	 Piscataway	 NJ) and immunoblotted with SK18 (Brady-Kalnay et al. 1993)	 which cross-reacts with PTPÏ.  2.5 Cell surface expression of PTPÏ  Cell surface expression of PTPÏ protein in baculovirus infected Sf9 cells was determined using a modified biotin-avidin reaction with the Cell Surface Protein Isolation Kit (catalog# 89991	 Pierce	 Rockford	 IL)	 as previously described (Yu et al. 2008). Briefly	 Sf9 cell media was removed and the flasks were incubated with rocking for 30 minutes at 4Â°C in 5ml of 0.25mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin in 1X PBS. The cells were mechanically removed from the flask	 centrifuged	 washed	 and lysed according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocols. To isolate cell surface expressed PTPÏ the cell lysate was added to a NeutrAvidin Gel column and incubated for 60 min at room temperature (RT) with rocking prior to washing and eluting proteins with 200Î¼l of sample buffer containing a final concentration of 55mM DTT for 60min at RT. The flow through was run on 6% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Total cell surface protein levels were normalized by immunoblotting cell lysates with an anti-actin antibody (JLA20). The normalized cell surface protein was run on 6% SDS-PAGE gels	 transferred to nitrocellulose and immunoblotted with antibodies to PTPÎ¼ that also recognized PTPÏ (SK18) followed by secondary antibody conjugated to HRP. The HRP signal was detected using a Fluor-S MAX MultiImager (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.	 Hercules	 CA).  2.6 Aggregation Assays  Sf9 cells were harvested by trituration. The cell suspensions were added to glass scintillation vials and incubated at 27Â°C at 90 rpm in a gyratory shaker for 30 minutes. For a given condition	 the cell suspension was transferred to a 100mm petri dish either prior to (0 time point) or 30 minutes after aggregation. Images were captured at 10X magnification with a Nikon TE-200 inverted fluorescent microscope (Tokyo	 Japan). To quantify cell aggregates	 pictures of four randomly selected fields were taken per dish. The area of each object (single cells and aggregates) was determined by the Metamorph software (Molecular Devices) using an auto-threshold setting for light objects and appropriate size filters that allowed the counting of cells and aggregates but not debris. The four replicates were combined to yield average readings per condition. The percent aggregation was then calculated as the average aggregate area at 30 minutes minus the average aggregate area at zero minutes divided by the average aggregate area at 30 minutes [(N30-N0)/N30]. A minimum of three independent experiments was performed per condition. Statistical significance was determined in Microsoft Excel using Studentâ€™s T-test. Error bars indicate standard error.  2.7 Site-directed mutagenesis  The I395V	 Y412F	 R453C	 Q479E	 S492F	 N510K	 T605M	 V648G	 A707T	 and L708P tumor-derived mutations (Wang et al. 2004) were generated by fusion PCR using the full-length PTPRT pVL1393-V5-His vector as the template. The primers 5â€™-TGGCCCACAGAACGTGGAAGTCGTAGACATCAGAGCC-3â€™ and 5â€™-CTTCCACGTTCTGTGGGCCA-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the I395V mutant; the primers 5â€™-CAGTGGGAGCCCTTCGGCTTCGCGGTGACCCGCTGCCAT-3â€™ and 5â€™-AAGCCGAAGGGCTCCCACTG-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the Y412F mutant; the primers 5â€™-CTACACCCTGCGAGGCCTGTGCCCCTTCATGACCATCCG-3â€™ and 5â€™-ACAGGCCTCGCAGGGTGTAG-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the R453C mutant; the primers 5â€™-GAGCGAGGAGCTGGTGGTGGAGACTGAGGAAGACGTTCC-3â€™ and 5â€™-CCACCACCAGCTCCTCGCTC-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the Q479E mutant; the primers 5â€™-TGTTCCTCTAGAATTCATCCAAGGGGGGCCCT TT-3â€™ and 5â€™-ATGAATTCTAGAGGAACA-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the S492F mutant; the primers 5â€™-TCCAGTGGAAACCTCCCAAGGAGACCAATGGGGTCATCA-3â€™ and 5â€™-CTTGGGAGGTTTCCACTGGA-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the N510K mutant; the primers 5â€™-CCATTGAATGAGACAGACATGACC ATCACAGTGATGCTG3-â€™ and 5â€™-ATGTCTGTCTCATTCAATGG-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the T605M mutant; the primers 5â€™-ATTATTGAGTGCTTTTC GGGGCCCGTGAGCTATCGGAAT-3â€™ and 5â€™-CCCGAAAAGCACTCAATAAT-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the V648G mutant; the primers 5â€™-CTACAGCATCTACTTCCAGACACTCAGCAAAGCCAATGG-3â€™ and 5â€™-TCTGGAAGTAGATGCTGTAG-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the A707T mutant; the primers 5â€™-AGCATCTACTTCCAGGCACCCAGCAAAGCCAATGGAGAG-3â€™ and 5â€™-GGTGCCTGGAAGTAGATGCT-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the L708P mutant.  2.8 Mapping of PTPÏ mutations onto the PTPÎ¼ crystal structure  The sequence of PTPÎ¼ and PTPÏ were aligned using CLUSTALW. Mutations probed in this study were mapped using this sequence alignment onto the PTPÎ¼ structure (PDB ID: 2V5Y). The figure was prepared utilizing PyMOL 1.2r1 (http://pymol.org).  Go to: 3. Results 3.1 Deletions in the MAM	 Ig	 and FNIII repeat domains of PTPÏ result in defective cell-cell aggregation  To test whether a protein mediates cell-cell aggregation or adhesion	 one has to express the protein of interest in the non-adhesive cells. Otherwise	 one cannot measure the aggregation or adhesion of a single molecule in the sea of other adhesion molecules naturally expressed in adhesive cells. This is the main reason that the non-adhesive Sf9 or Drosophila S2 cells are widely used models for such studies. To our knowledge	 nearly all cell lines of epithelial origin are adhesive cells and thus are not suitable for these studies. Introduction of putative adhesion molecules into non-adhesive Drosophila S2 insect cells has been used to demonstrate adhesive functions for fasciclin II	 connectin	 Dtrk	 ARK	 Neuroglian	 and Capricious molecules directly (Bellosta et al. 1995; Hortsch et al. 1995; Nose et al. 1992; Pulido et al. 1992; Shinza-Kameda et al. 2006; Snow et al. 1989). In a similar approach	 we and others demonstrated that the full-length form of PTPÎ¼ induced aggregation	 via a homophilic binding mechanism	 when expressed in nonadhesive Sf9 insect cells	 which are derived from the Fall army-worm Spodoptera frugiperda (Brady-Kalnay et al. 1993; Gebbink et al. 1993; Zondag et al. 1995). We have also used this system for analyzing PTPRT/PTP rho (Yu et al.	 2008). Examples of other cell adhesion molecules that have been studied in Sf9 cells include L1 (Gouveia et al. 2008)	 Galectin-3 (Inohara and Raz 1995) and C-CAM1 (Phan et al. 2001). Insect S2 and Sf9 cells are extremely useful systems to analyze adhesive mechanisms of cell adhesion molecules.  The MAM domain	 Ig domain	 and first two-FNIII repeats are essential for PTPÎ¼ cell-cell aggregation (Brady-Kalnay and Tonks 1994; Zondag et al. 1995). To test whether these domains are the minimal essential regions required for PTPÏ cell-cell aggregation	 baculoviral PTPÏ deletion constructs of the MAM domain	 Ig domain	 and each of the four individual FNIII repeats were made and expressed in non-adhesive Sf9 insect cells (Figure 1). All the PTPÏ deletion constructs were expressed and appropriately trafficked to the cell surface (Figure 1). To test whether these domains contribute to PTPÏ-dependent adhesion	 Sf9 cells were evaluated for their ability to mediate cell-cell aggregation when expressing the deletion constructs. Aggregation assays with Sf9 cells expressing the deletion constructs were conducted alongside aggregation assays using Sf9 cells expressing wild-type PTPÏ	 which mediates cell-cell aggregation (Figure 2) and serves as a positive control (Yu et al. 2008). Deletion of any of the extracellular domains of PTPÏ resulted in defective cell-cell aggregation compared to aggregation of wild-type PTPÏ expressing Sf9 cells (Figure 2). Deletion of the fourth FNIII repeat was the least severe where ~23% aggregation was observed. Deletion of the MAM domain	 Ig domain and FNIII repeats 1	 2 or 3 resulted in 5â€“16% aggregation. When the level of aggregation was quantified	 we determined that all of the deletion constructs resulted in a large and statistically significant reduction in cell-cell aggregation (Figure 2	 p-value<0.005). Together with our previous study	 these results demonstrate that all of the extracellular domains of PTPÏ are necessary for PTPÏ-mediated cell-cell aggregation.  Figure 1 Figure 1 PTPÏ deletion constructs are all expressed at the cell surface. Constructs containing deletions of one extracellular domain of PTPÏ each were generated and expressed in Sf9 cells. Total cellular protein and cell surface protein were isolated ... Figure 2 Figure 2 Deletion of any of the extracellular domains of PTPÏ disrupts cell-cell aggregation. Sf9 cells expressing deletion constructs of the individual extracellular domains of PTPÏ were allowed to aggregate for 30 minutes prior to imaging. Scale ... 3.2 Tumor-Derived PTPÏ Mutations in the FNIII repeats result in defective cell-cell aggregation  We next tested the effects of human tumor-derived mutations in the FNIII repeats of PTPÏ on PTPÏ-mediated cell-cell aggregation. We recently demonstrated that tumor-derived mutations in the MAM and Ig domains of PTPÏ are defective in cell-cell aggregation using the Sf9 aggregation assay (Yu et al. 2008)	 and given the above results	 we hypothesized that mutations in the FNIII domains would likewise result in defective aggregation. Ten human tumor-derived mutations are located in the second	 third and fourth FNIII repeats of PTPÏ (Wang et al. 2004). To test whether these mutations also affect cell-cell aggregation	 we engineered the ten human mutations by site-directed mutagenesis using the full-length PTPÏ baculoviral construct as a template (see Figure 3). The ten mutations are expressed in Sf9 cells at the expected molecular weight and at similar levels to full-length human PTPÏ (Figure 3). All of these mutants are expressed at the cell surface (Figure 3). When these mutant PTPÏ proteins were expressed in Sf9 cells and tested in aggregation assays	 we observed that all of the mutant PTPÏ proteins resulted in fewer and smaller aggregates than wild type PTPÏ (Figure 4). When the level of aggregation was quantified	 we determined that all of the FNIII mutations significantly reduced cell-cell aggregation (16â€“43%) compared to cells expressing wild type PTPÏ (68% aggregation	 p-value<0.008	 Figure 4).  Figure 3 Figure 3 PTPÏ proteins containing tumor-derived mutations in their FNIII domains are expressed at the cell surface. Ten mutations in the FNIII domains of PTPÏ were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in Sf9 cells. Total cellular ... Figure 4 Figure 4 Tumor derived mutations in FNIII domains of PTPÏ are defective in cell-cell aggregation. Sf9 cells expressing the mutated PTPÏ proteins were allowed to aggregate for 30 minutes prior to imaging. Scale bar equals 100Î¼m. The percentage ... Go to: 4. Discussion PTPRT/PTPÏ is the most highly mutated tyrosine phosphatase in human colon carcinomas. We and others found that PTPRT/ PTPÏ is also mutated in lung	 gastric and skin (melanoma) cancers (Forbes et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2004). The spectrum of mutations	 which included nonsense mutations and frameshifts	 suggested that these mutations were inactivating (Wang et al. 2004). Biochemical analyses demonstrated that missense mutations in the catalytic domains of PTPRT diminished its phosphatase activity and overexpression of PTPRT inhibited colon cancer cell growth. Moreover	 we showed previously that the tumor-derived mutations in the MAM and Ig domains of PTPÏ are defective in cell-cell adhesion (Yu et al. 2008). All these data suggest that PTPRT/PTPÏ normally functions as a tumor suppressor gene. The experiments presented in this manuscript evaluate the contribution of the individual extracellular domains of PTPÏ to PTPÏ-mediated adhesion. We demonstrate that in addition to the MAM and Ig domains	 the FNIII repeats are required for PTPÏ-mediated adhesion. Importantly	 we also show that PTPÏ-mediated adhesion is impaired by human tumor-derived mutations in those FNIII repeats. These studies indicate that all the tumor-derived mutations located in the extracellular domain of PTPRT are loss-of-function mutations	 thereby providing further evidence that PTPRT is a tumor suppressor. This notion is further supported by our recent study showing that PTPRT knockout mice are highly susceptible to colon specific carcinogen azoxymethane (AOM)-induced colon cancer (Zhao et al.).  PTPÎ¼-mediated cell-cell aggregation requires the MAM domain	 Ig domain	 and the first two FNIII repeats (Aricescu et al. 2006; Aricescu et al. 2007; Brady-Kalnay and Tonks 1994; Cismasiu et al. 2004; Zondag et al. 1995). The entire extracellular domain of PTPÎ¼ is predicted to make a rigid conformation with extensive interfaces between each of the domains (Aricescu et al. 2006). The minimal adhesive unit for functional cell-cell aggregation is the MAM domain	 Ig domain and the first two FNIII repeats (Aricescu et al. 2006; Brady-Kalnay and Tonks 1994; Zondag et al. 1995). However	 the FNIII repeats appear to play a role in spacing the key homophilic interaction domain(s) a certain distance from the plasma membrane. Deletion of the FNIII repeats changed the intercellular spacing of two apposing membranes (Aricescu et al. 2007). Cell-cell aggregation assays of the FNIII deletion constructs were not performed in that study (Aricescu et al. 2007). The amino acid residues of the interfaces between the extracellular domains are highly conserved between members of the type IIB RPTP subfamily (Aricescu et al. 2006; Aricescu et al. 2007) therefore it is likely that the PTPÏ adhesive interface resembles that of PTPÎ¼. Together our data support the hypothesis that the essential regions for PTPÏ-mediated adhesion resemble those of PTPÎ¼.  To gain insight into how the point mutations may alter the adhesive function of PTPÏ	 we modeled the human tumor derived PTPÏ mutations onto the crystal structure of PTPÎ¼ (Figure 5). The crystal structure of PTPÎ¼ includes only the first three FNIII repeats (Aricescu et al. 2007). Four of these mutations fall within the second FNIII (FNIII-2) repeat (I395V	 Y412F	 R453C	 Q479E). It is important to note that FNIII-2 is required for efficient cell-cell adhesion (Aricescu et al. 2006). Two of the mutations fall in the third FNIII (FNIII-3) repeat (S492F	 N510K). The mutation within the linker region between FNIII-1 and FNII-2 (Y412F) could alter the flexibility or positioning between the two domains. The other mutations (I395V R453C	 Q479E	 S492F	 N510K) appear to be clustered in surface exposed regions and/or near the linker regions between FNIII-2 and FNIII-3 that could alter flexibility	 position of individual FNIII repeats and/or protein-protein interactions. While these mutations do not correspond to the adhesive interface hypothesized for PTPÎ¼ based upon a single static crystal structure (Aricescu et al. 2007)	 some of the mutations fall within the FNIII-2 repeat which is required for adhesion	 and all of these surface modifications would likely alter either the three-dimensional topology and/or cis/trans interactions of PTPÏ.  Figure 5 Figure 5 Structural modeling of the point mutations of PTPÏ. The point mutations (indicated in red) evaluated in this manuscript were modeled onto the equivalent sites in the crystal structure of PTPÎ¼. The PTPÏ mutations likely alter cell-cell ... Other type IIB RPTPs also function as tumor suppressor genes	 by regulating adhesion and/or tyrosine phosphorylation of effector proteins. Expression of PTPÎ¼ is reduced in human glioblastomas (GBM) and cell lines (Burgoyne et al. 2009a). Reduction in full-length PTPÎ¼ expression with a concomitant increase in a proteolytically processed cytoplasmic fragment of PTPÎ¼ is observed in GBM cells and both are correlated with decreased adhesion and increased migration observed in the disease (Burgoyne et al. 2009a; Burgoyne et al. 2009b). Over-expression of the full-length form of PTPÎ¼ suppressed migration of GBM cells and reduces their survival (Burgoyne et al. 2009b). Of note	 at the same time that stable cell adhesion is reduced due to the loss of full-length PTPÎ¼ expression in GBM cells	 a catalytically active cytoplasmic fragment of PTPÎ¼ is released and translocates to the nucleus (Burgoyne et al. 2009b). Catalytic activity of this fragment is also necessary for cell migration and viability of GBM cells (Burgoyne et al. 2009b). Therefore	 both the tyrosine phosphatase activity of the cytoplasmic fragment of PTPÎ¼ and the loss of PTPÎ¼-mediated adhesion may contribute to the invasiveness of GBM cells.  PTPÎº is also implicated in tumor progression. PTPÎº expression is reduced in melanoma cell lines and human tissue biopsies (McArdle et al. 2001)	 and in Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma cells (Flavell et al. 2008). Over-expression of PTPÎº in Hodgkin lymphoma cells reduces cellular proliferation and survival (Flavell et al. 2008). Like PTPÎ¼	 PTPÎº is proteolytically processed (Anders et al. 2006)	 potentially as a result of aberrant glycosylation (Kim et al. 2006). It is not clear whether adhesion or catalytic activity of PTPÎº is required for its tumor suppressor activity (Flavell et al. 2008; Kim et al. 2006). Of note	 the cleaved cytoplasmic domain fragment of PTPÎº is catalytically active	 translocates to the nucleus and promotes Î²-catenin-mediated transcription (Anders et al. 2006). Signaling via the PTPÎº cytoplasmic fragment might augment the loss of stable cell-cell adhesion and may promote tumor progression.  Although speculative	 it is interesting to postulate that tyrosine phosphatase activity and or cleavage of PTPÏ will also be an important element of its tumor suppressor activity	 as has been demonstrated for PTPÎ¼ and PTPÎº. Interestingly	 we identified and validated STAT3 as a direct substrate of PTPRT (Zhang et al. 2007). STAT3 is latent transcription factor that translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus after being phosphorylated at the Y705 residue. It is possible that the cleaved intracellular fragment of PTPÏ	 which contains the phosphatase domains	 translocates to nucleus and dephosphorylates STAT3. Besco and colleagues found that PTPRT associates with the adhesion molecule E-cadherin and its binding partner p120 catenin	 which are PTPRT substrates (Besco et al. 2006). p120 also translocates to the nucleus and associates with the Kaiso transcription factor (Daniel and Reynolds 1999). Given the frequency and distribution of mutations in PTPRT/PTPÏ in human colon and other cancers	 a more thorough understanding of its biological function is warranted. 																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
4	48||Metastasis is the leading cause of death for gastric carcinoma (GC). An epigenetic biomarker panel for predicting GC metastasis could have significant clinical impact on the care of GC patients. The main purpose of this study is to characterize the methylation differences between GCs with and without metastasis.  Experimental Design  Genome-wide DNA methylation profiles between 4 metastatic and 4 non-metastatic GCs and their surgical margins (SM) were analyzed using methylated-CpG island amplification with microarray. The methylation states of 73 candidate genes were further analyzed in GC patients in a discovery cohort (n=108) using DHPLC	 bisulfite-sequencing	 and MethyLight. The predictive values of potential metastasis-methylation biomarkers were validated in GC patient cohorts in China (n=330)	 Japan (n=129)	 and Korea (n=153).  Results  The GC genome showed significantly higher proportions of hypomethylation in the promoter and exon-1 regions	 as well as increased hypermethylation of intragenic fragments when compared to SMs. Significant differential methylation was validated in the CGIs of 15 genes (Ps<0.05) and confirmed using bisulfite-sequencing. These genes included BMP3	 BNIP3	 CDKN2A	 ECEL1	 ELK1	 GFRA1	 HOXD10	 KCNH1	 PSMD10	 PTPRT	 SIGIRR	 SRF	 TBX5	 TFPI2	 and ZNF382. Methylation changes of GFRA1	 SRF and ZNF382 resulted in up- or down-regulation of their transcription. Most importantly	 the prevalence of GFRA1	 SRF	 and ZNF382 methylation alterations was consistently and coordinately associated with GC metastasis and the patientsâ€™ overall survival throughout discovery and validation cohorts in China	 Japan and Korea.  Conclusion  Methylation changes of GFRA1	 SRF	 and ZNF382 may be a potential biomarker set for prediction of GC metastasis.  Keywords: gastric cancer	 metastasis	 DNA methylation Go to: Introduction Gastric carcinoma (GC) is the second leading cause of cancer death throughout the world (1). Global statistics showed that in 2008 alone	 nearly 989	000 people were diagnosed with GC	 and approximately 464	000 people died from this disease (2). Currently	 GC prognosis is primarily determined based on the clinical data and pathological stages of patients at the time of diagnosis and treatment (3). However	 successful management of GC patients is still hampered by the lack of highly sensitive and specific biomarkers capable of predicting prognosis and likelihood of metastasis. Epigenetic alterations	 including aberrant DNA methylation changes	 may play an important role in gastric carcinogenesis as indicated by the increased hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes in GC patients (4â€“6). Given their important functions in cancer initiation and progression	 methylation changes are being investigated as potential biomarkers for the early detection of cancers	 the prediction of cancer progression	 and the prediction of chemotherapeutic sensitivity (7).  Recent advances in high-throughput technologies have significantly expanded our capability of interrogating genome-wide DNA methylation changes in cancer (6	8	 9). Methylated-CpG island amplification with microarray (MCAM) is one of the most powerful tools available for displaying differential methylation related to pathogenesis (10). A number of DNA methylome studies have been reported in a variety of primary cancers	 including GC. However	 few studies have been conducted to vigorously validate the methylation changes of the candidate genes at the single molecule level in numerous tumor samples (6	 11). Therefore	 despite the long list of differentially methylated genes in GC patients	 a promising DNA methylation biomarker has not yet reached to the clinical utility.  In the present study	 genome-wide DNA methylation analysis using the MCAM assay was performed in GCs (10). A large number of differentially methylated regions were identified between GCs and their corresponding surgical margin (SM). In addition	 differential methylation profiles between metastatic and non-metastatic GCs were identified. Most importantly	 the methylation status of promoter CpG islands (CGIs) from 73 candidate genes was characterized using denatured high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) in 48 pairs of gastric samples from GC and non-cancer patients (12). The predictive values of three potential metastasis-related candidates were further validated in multiple cohorts from China	 Japan	 and Korea following the Reporting Prognostic Tumor Marker Study (REMARK) guidelines. We demonstrated that the methylation status of GFRA1	 SRF and ZNF382 could be used as potential synergistic biomarkers for the prediction of GC metastasis.  Go to: Materials and Methods Patient characteristics and sample collection  A total of 504 patients with GC from 3 academic medical centers in China	 Japan	 and Korea were included in this study. The study was approved by the local Institution Review Boards (IRB) at each institution	 and all patients were given written informed consent unless the IRB permitted a waiver. The 2003 UICC-TNM (tumor-node-metastasis) system was used for the classification of GCs (13). 330 Chinese GC inpatients that underwent surgical treatment at Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute between 1999 and 2006 were enrolled in the discovery and validation cohorts based on the following criteria: a) availability of frozen	 fresh GC and SM samples; b) follow-up available for at least 5 years; c) falls into the proper pathological TNM (pTNM) stages as described in the results section. In the validation cohort from Korea	 153 GC inpatients that received surgical treatment were selected from Seoul National University Hospital during 2004 with a follow-up of at least 3 years. Paraffin-embedded SM samples were used in the Korea study. The validation cohort from Japan included 78 GC inpatients that acquired surgical treatment between 1995 and 2002 with a follow-up of at least 5 years	 as well as an additional 79 GC patients between 2010 and 2011 who did not have survival data. The SM samples were not available for these Japanese patients. GCs were classified as cardiac or non-cardiac in terms of location (14). Patients with pre-operative chemotherapy were not included in the discovery or independent validation cohorts. Normal/gastritis biopsies (NorG) from 56 outpatients at Peking University Cancer Hospital were used as the cancer-free controls.  Study design  The discovery patient cohort from Peking University Cancer Hospital consisted of 54 randomly selected patients with non-metastatic GCs and 54 matched patients with distant metastatic GCs. Among them	 8 paired GC and the corresponding SM samples from patients with or without distant and lymph metastasis were analyzed using MCAM on a customized Agilent promoter array. The clinical and histological features of these 8 patients can be found in Supplementary Table S1. The remaining GC and SM samples from 100 patients were used for the characterization of 73 CGIs using DHPLC and bisulfite clone sequencing. The methylation states of the three most promising candidate CGIs were analyzed in three analogous independent validation cohorts from China (n=222)	 Japan (n=129)	 and Korea (n=153). The overall study design is outlined in Supplementary Fig. S1. Genomic DNA was isolated using phenol/chloroform extraction.  Cell lines and culture  MKN74 cell line was kindly provided by Dr. Yasuhito Yuasa at Tokyo Medical and Dental University in 2010; RKO cell line	 from Dr. Guoren Deng	 at University California in San Francisco in 2001; AGS	 by Dr. Chengchao Shou in 2009	 HeLa and MGC803	 by Dr. Yang Ke in 2004	 at Peking University Cancer Hospital. All cells were grown in monolayer in appropriate medium supplemented with 10% FBS and maintained at 37Â°C in humidified air with 5% CO2. These cell lines were tested and authenticated by Beijing JianLian Genes Technology Co.	 LTD before they were used in this study. STR patterns were analyzed using Goldeneyeâ„¢20A STR Identifiler PCR Amplification Kit. Gene Mapper v3.2 software (ABI) was used to match the STR pattern with the online databases of National Platform of Experimental Cell Resources for Sci-Tech for MGC803 cell and the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) for other cells.  Genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in GC tissues using MCAM  Genomic DNA (2 Î¼g) from 8 pairs of fresh GC and SM samples was analyzed using the MCAM approach (10). Briefly	 genomic DNA was digested consecutively with SmaI and XmaI which cut unmethylated and methylated CCCGGG sites	 respectively. The XmaI digestion produces sticky ends that can be ligated to linkers	 while SmaI digestion results in blunt ends that are unable to be ligated to linkers. The ligation-mediated PCR products from GC and SM samples were purified and labeled with Alexafluor647 or 555	 respectively	 using the Bioprime Plus Array CGH Indirect Genomic Labeling kit (Invitrogen	 Carlsbad	 CA) according to the manufacturersâ€™ instructions. The labeled DNA was co-hybridized to a custom designed Agilent Oligonucleotide Array	 and the slides were washed and scanned as described previously (15). Data was extracted using the Feature Extraction Tool (Agilent Technologies	 Santa Clara	 CA) and exported for further analysis. The custom designed Agilent oligonucleotide array was designed using Agilent eArray service (https://earray.chem.agilent.com/earray). The array consisted of approximately 99	028 probes (44â€“60mers) that covered 29	879 in silico SmaI-digested DNA fragments (>60bp and <2000bp) in the human genome. The probes were tiled within each fragment with 100bp spacing. The methylation states of 6177 genes were determined using this custom methylation array.  Microarray data normalization and probe/gene selection  The raw array data was processed and normalized by the Beijing CO-FLY Bioinformatic Company. Background model adjustment was carried out using the minimum normalization algorithm. Systematic differences between arrays were normalized using the quantile method as described (16	 17). The methylation array data	 as well as the probe information	 have been deposited into the Gene Expression Omnibus under accession number GSE47724.  The mean intensity of the normalized array hybridization (methylation) signal of each probe for sex-related chromosomes and autosomes in the SM samples from 4 males and 4 females (Supplementary Fig. S2Aâ€“C) were analyzed. As expected	 the intensities of 784 of 2390 X chromosome-probes (32.8%) were significantly higher in the female samples than the male samples (Studentâ€™s t-test	 P<0.05); in contrast	 35 of 87 Y chromosome-probes (40.2%) were significantly higher in the male samples when compared to the female samples. These sex-specific differences were only observed in 1250 of 96	550 (1.3%) probes in the 22 autosomes. These results confirmed that the quality of the normalized data is sufficient to differentiate sex-specific DNA methylation and suitable for studying GC- or metastasis-related methylation changes.  The methylation signal ratio ([GC]/[SM]) was calculated for each array probe. The Studentâ€™s paired t-test (P<0.01) was used to identify the differentially methylated probes between GC and SM samples from the 8 patients analyzed. The Mann-Whitney U-test (P<0.029) was used to identify the metastasis-specific differentially methylated probes between the 4 metastatic and 4 non-metastatic GC patients. The methylation ratio data including the adjusted P-values for each probe are included in the data file S1.  The difference between GC-related hypermethylated and hypomethylated probes was calculated for each sliding window (sequence or region) using 51 probe-matched fragments	 which included the target probe along with 25 probes both upstream and downstream of the target. Probes near the centromeres and telomeres of each chromosome were not included due to the absence of the 25 upstream or downstream probes. The numerical differences for 99K probes were charted to display the detailed regional methylation trend (or net methylation signal) for the corresponding chromosome arm.  Identification of differentially methylated candidate genes  In order to identify GC and metastasis-specific differentially methylated candidate genes for further evaluation	 the promoter and exon-1 regions were focused on due to their known inverse correlation to epigenetic repression of gene transcription. The differentially methylated probes in these regions were defined as the top-100 probes and used in hierarchical clustering analysis and preparation of a heatmap	 when their P-values were less than 0.05	 and their absolute mean difference-values were within the top 100. Candidate genes were selected from these GC- or metastasis-related probes according to their function information in the public databases.  Hot-start PCR and DHPLC analysis  CpG-free universal primer sets and bisulfite-modified DNA (18) were used to amplify the genes of interest. The PCR reaction mixture (30 Î¼l) included 20 ng DNA template	 0.15 mmol/L dNTP	 0.15 Î¼mol/L of each primer	 and 0.9 U of HotStart Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen GmbH	 Hilden	 Germany). The PCR products were then analyzed quantitatively by DHPLC using the WAVEÂ® DNA Fragment Analysis System (12	 19). PCR products of hypermethylated and hypomethylated genes were separated using a DNASepÂ® analytical column (Transgenomic) at the corresponding partial denaturing temperature as listed in the supplementary materials and methods). M.SssI-methylated genomic DNA	 obtained from blood samples	 was used as a positive control. A sample containing a methylated PCR product peak was defined as methylation-positive and used to calculate methylation positive rate [ratio of methylation-positive sample number to total sample number]. The peak areas corresponding to the methylated and unmethylated PCR products were used to calculate the percentage of methylated copies [proportion of hypermethylated copies = methylation-peak area/ total peak area] for each gene analyzed.  MethyLight  The methylation states of GFRA1	 SRF	 and ZNF382 were determined using the MethyLight assays. Gene-specific probes labeled with 6FAM and TAMRA were employed to quantify the relative copy number of methylated alleles compared to the COL2A1 control (20). The sequences of the primer set and gene-specific probes can be found in the supplementary materials and methods.  Statistical analysis  The SPSS 16.0 Trend-test and Pearsonâ€™s Chi-square test were used to analyze the difference in methylation frequency between GC and SM samples and between metastatic and non-metastatic GC samples. Studentâ€™s paired t-test	 Kruskal-Wallis H-test	 and One-Way ANOVA were used to identify differentially methylated regions between the different groups of samples. The Mann-Whitney U-test and Studentâ€™s t-test were used to analyze the association between the percentage of methylated copies and the clinicopathological features. All statistical tests were two-sided	 and P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. The cutoff value was calculated according to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve using the percentage of methylated copies to predict GC metastasis. The log-rank test was used to compare survival time between groups. Cox-proportional hazards models were used to identify independent predictors of survival (month) with adjustment for relevant clinical covariates. Functional annotation of the differentially methylated regions was performed using EpiExplorer (21).  Go to: Results Genome-wide analysis of GC-related differential DNA methylation  In order to identify differentially methylated genes related to GC development and metastasis	 genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was conducted in 8 pairs of GC and SM samples using the MCAM assay utilizing a 99K custom-designed Agilent oligonucleotide microarray as described above (10). Through this method	 9860 probes in 4047 genes were identified with significant methylation differences between the 8 GC and 8 SM samples (Paired t-test	 P<0.01). Of the differentially methylated probes	 4177 showed hypermethylation (42%; [GC]>[SM])	 while the remaining probes were hypomethylated (58%; [GC]<[SM]) (Data file S1). Nearly half of the hypomethylated probes (49%) were found to be within a 102~3 bp region of the transcription start site (TSS)	 while 42% of the hypermethylated probes were within a 103~4 bp region of the TSS (Supplementary Fig. S2D; P<0.0000001). When compared to the hypermethylated probes	 the hypomethylated probes showed a considerably higher GC content than the hypermethylated ones (Median	 0.68 vs. 0.50)	 indicating the hypomethylation lies mainly in typical CGIs (Supplementary Fig. S2E). The promoter and exon-1 regions showed significantly higher proportions of hypomethylation to hypermethylation (26.8% vs. 23.4% for the promoter	 P=1.2Ã—10âˆ’4; 13.8% vs. 3.0% for exon-1	 P=5.5Ã—10âˆ’75) in GCs compared to SMs. The opposite trend was seen in the intragenic regions	 which showed a significantly lower proportion of hypomethylation to hypermethylation (32.1% vs. 41.5%	 P=5.4Ã—10âˆ’22) (Fig. 1A). A heatmap displaying the top-100 differentially methylated probes between GCs and SMs in the promoter and exon-1 regions is provided in Fig. 1B.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Distribution of probes with significant GC-related differential methylation changes in the human GC genome Most GC-related differentially methylated probes were clustered in specific chromosomal regions	 especially sub-telomeric regions (Data File S2). Although the presence of SmaI/XmaI restriction sites primarily determined the distribution patterns of probes with GC-related methylation changes	 certain chromosomal locations showed increased hypomethylation with little to no overlapping hypermethylation. After being normalized with respect to the probe density	 chromosomes 7	8	 and 20 were clearly shown to harbor multiple long-range hypermethylated domains. In contrast	 most regions in chromosomes 3	4	14	15	 and 18 were found to be more favorable to long-range hypomethylation (Fig. 1C).  Genome-wide analysis of GC metastasis-related differential DNA methylation  Among the 8 pairs of GC and SM samples analysed	 half were metastatic GCs and the other half were sex-	 age-	 location-	 and differentiation-matched non-metastatic control GCs (Supplementary Table S1). The MCAM analysis identified 8553 probes that were differentially methylated between the metastatic and non-metastatic GC groups (Mann-Whitney U-test	 P<0.029). Among these metastasis-related candidate probes	 623 probes corresponded to 480 genes that overlapped with the GC-related genes identified above. A heatmap displaying the top 100 metastasis-related	 differentially methylated probes is provided in Fig. 1D.  Identification in 15 GC-related aberrantly methylated genes  From the list of differentially methylated CGIs	 63 candidate genes were selected for further analysis based on their known functions and statistical significance of differential methylation signals between metastatic and non-metastatic GCs or between GCs and SMs (Supplementary Table S2). Ten known tumor-related genes that were not included in the oligonucleotide array were also selected as complementary and control genes for the validation study. The CGIs of these 73 genes were amplified using CpG-free primer sets. The bisulfite-PCR products were then analyzed using DHPLC to quantify the methylation levels of these CGIs in the 8 paired GC and SM samples (Fig. 2A; Data file S3). Differential methylation was observed in 37 CGIs between the 8 pairs of samples (Supplementary Table S2	 underlined). The methylation levels of these 37 CGIs were further examined in additional 40 pairs of GC and SM samples	 as well as 56 NorG samples. Significant differential methylation between paired GC/SM and NorG samples was observed in 15 CGIs (Ps<0.05; Table 1). The number of samples with hypermethylated CGIs in the promoter and exon-1 of BMP3	 BNIP3	 ECEL1	 HOXD10	 KCNH1	 PSMD10	 PTPRT	 SRF	 TBX5	 TFPI2	 and ZNF382 gradually increased from the NorG â†’ SM â†’ GC samples (Trend or Chi-square test	 Ps<0.040). These results suggest that hypermethylation of these 11 genes may play significant roles in GC development. Furthermore	 the GC samples showed a significantly higher percentage of hypermethylated CDKN2A and GFRA1 (Ps<0.050) and significantly lower levels of methylation in ELK1 and SIGIRR when compared to the SM samples.  Figure 2 Figure 2 DNA methylation of GFRA1	 SRF	 and ZNF382 in GC samples Table 1 Table 1 Prevalence of CGI methylation in gastric mucosa samples containing various pathological changes from GC patients and non-cancerous control patients The positive rate of methylation in CDKN2A and PSMD10 was significantly higher in the GC and SM samples than was seen in the NorG samples. In contrast	 the positive-rate and proportion of methylated ELK1 and GFRA1 in the NorG samples were strikingly higher than in the GC and SM samples	 indicating that hypomethylation of these genes occurs in gastric carcinogenesis as field effects. Furthermore	 the positive rates of BNIP3	 KCNH1	 and ZNF382 methylation in the GC samples were more than 3-times higher than the SM and NorG samples (29% vs. 7~4%	 42% vs. 4~14%	 and 69% vs. 18~23%	 respectively). Based on this information	 these genes are most likely involved in GC-specific methylation changes.  The methylation states of these CGIs were further confirmed using traditional bisulfite sequencing. The bisulfite sequencing results were consistently in agreement with the DHPLC analysis (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S3). In addition	 quantitative MethyLight assays using fresh or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples further validated the DHPLC results (Supplementary Fig. S4A; Spearman test	 P<0.020). To understand if methylation changes in these CGIs affect gene expression	 the mRNA levels of SRF	 ZNF382	 and GFRA1 were analyzed in matched tissue samples using quantitative RT-PCR. The qRT-PCR results showed that mRNA expression of all three genes was inversely correlated with the prevalence of methylation in their CGIs (Supplementary Fig. S4B; Spearman test	 P<0.050).  Confirmation of GC metastasis-related DNA methylation markers  Among the above 48 pairs of GC and SM samples	 24 pairs were from patients with lymphatic and distant metastasis	 and 24 pairs were from sex-	 age-	 location-	 and GC differentiation grade-matched patients without metastasis. Thus	 the methylation states of these 15 CGIs were further analyzed to determine if they are associated with GC metastasis. DHPLC results showed that the methylation states of the BMP3	 GFRA1	 SRF	 and ZNF382 CGIs were significantly different between metastatic and non-metastatic GC samples. The proportion of methylated BMP3 and GFRA1 was lower in the metastatic GC samples than the non-metastatic GC samples (median	 1.8% vs. 5.9%; 8.6% vs. 38.6%; Mann-Whitney U-test	 Ps<0.040). The positive rate of SRF and ZNF382 methylation was also lower in the metastatic GC samples than the non-metastatic GC samples (4% vs. 33%; 54% vs. 79%	 P=0.020/0.066). Therefore	 the relationship between GC metastasis and methylation of these four CGIs was tested in additional GC and SM samples obtained from Chinese patients (n=50~60). When these samples were taken together as a discovery cohort	 the relationship between GC lymph/distant metastasis and the methylation changes in GFRA1	 SRF	 and ZNF382 was statistically significant (Table 2); however	 such an association was not observed for BMP3 (data not shown).  Table 2 Table 2 SRF	 ZNF382	 and GFRA1 methylation prevalence comparison in SM and GC samples from Chinese patients in the discovery cohort with various clinicopathological characteristics To investigate whether the methylation status of the three potential biomarkers mentioned above had an impact on overall survival	 Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed on each gene individually. Results showed that the overall survival of GC patients with GFRA1 or ZNF382 methylation-high (cut-off value: percentage of methylated copies >26.4% for GFRA1 or 1.3% for ZNF382) or SRF methylation-positive was elongated when compared to methylation-low or methylation-negative patients in the discovery cohort (log-rank test	 P=0.068	 Fig. 3A; P=0.010	 Fig. 3B; P=0.001	 Fig. 3C	 respectively). Sub-stratification analysis revealed that SRF methylation was only correlated with overall survival in patients with non-cardiac GCs (P<0.033) but not with cardiac GCs (P=0.146). Therefore	 only non-cardiac GC patients were included in the survival analysis in the following SRF methylation validation cohorts.  Figure 3 Figure 3 Kaplan-Meier survival curves of GC patients with different GFRA1	 SRF	 and ZNF382 methylation states The predictive value of these methylation markers for GC metastasis was further confirmed using three independent validation cohorts in China (n=222)	 Japan (n=129)	 and Korea (n=153). Because the proportion of both methylated and unmethylated alleles of CGIs can be quantitatively and simultaneously determined using DHPLC	 this method was consistently used to detect the methylation levels within these CGIs in freshly-frozen gastric samples from Chinese and Japanese patients. However	 MethyLight was used to analyze the paraffin-embedded samples from the Korean patients	 as fresh samples were not available. Results from these cohorts showed that the methylation positive rates of GFRA1	 SRF	 and ZNF382 were inversely and significantly correlated with pTNM stage and lymph metastasis in all three cohorts (Table 3). Kaplan-Meier analysis also showed that the overall survival of GC patients with higher methylation levels of GFRA1 and SRF CGIs was consistently longer than those without methylation of these two genes across all three validation cohorts (Fig. 3A and 3B). However	 correlation between ZNF382 methylation and overall survival of GC patients was not statistically significant in all three validation cohorts (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that ZNF382 methylation may be a weak GC metastasis biomarker when compared with GFRA1 and SRF methylation.  Table 3 Table 3 Comparison of SRF	 ZNF382	 and GFRA1 methylation positive rates in GC patients with various clinicopathological characteristics in the Chinese	 Japanese and Korean validation cohorts* In addition	 after adjustment for age	 sex	 differentiation	 location	 pTNM stage	 and vascular embolus	 GFRA1 or SRF methylation was still an adequate prognostic indicator in multivariate analysis among all patients in these validation cohorts (hazard ratios [HR]=0.543 or 0.395; 95%CI [0.304â€“0.938] or [0.165â€“0.945]; n=300 or 452).  Sub-stratification analysis showed that the overall survival of stage-I&II GC patients with methylated SRF was significantly elongated when compared to SRF methylation-negative patients in all four cohorts (HR=0.357	 95%CI [0.164â€“0.778]	 n=198). Similar difference was also observed for GFRA1 or ZNF382 methylation-high	 but not statistically significant (HR=0.608 or 0.498	 95%CI [0.336â€“1.099] or [0.243â€“1.023]	 n=173 or 167). Among GC patients from Korea whose histological types of GCs were available	 GFRA1 methylation-high was significantly associated with low-risk of metastasis of both intestinal- and diffuse-types of GCs (positive rate: 82.4% and 76.5% for non-metastatic GCs; 43.2% and 43.1% for metastatic GCs	 Ps<0.05). GFRA1 methylation-high was also significantly correlated with longer overall survival of diffuse-type GC patients (HR=0.482	 95%CI [0.247â€“0.938]	 n=67). However	 ZNF382 methylation-high was significantly associated with low-risk of metastasis of intestinal-type GCs (93.8% vs. 62.5%	 P=0.036)	 but not diffuse-type GCs.  Synergic analysis of three methylation markers  In order to investigate if a combination of the methylation markers (GFRA1	 SRF	 and ZNF382) has a synergistic effect on predicting GC metastasis	 the merged data was reanalyzed in the above 4 patient cohorts. As expected	 the number of patients with one or more methylated genes among the three-gene panel was significantly decreased in GC samples with lymph/distant metastasis (Fig. 3D left; linear-trend test	 P<0.00001; one gene vs. two genes	 P=0.046). The sensitivity and specificity of 2~3 positive-methylation changes of 3 genes for detection of non-metastatic GCs were 60% and 67%	 respectively. The positive and negative predictive values were 57% and 69%. In addition	 multivariate analysis also showed that the number of combined methylation changes of GFRA1	 SRF	 and ZNF382 was an independent predictor of overall survival for GC patients (n=246) after adjusting for the pTNM stage	 GC location	 differentiation	 vascular embolus	 age	 and sex (HR=0.734; 95%CI [0.562â€“0.958]) (Fig. 3D right). The pTNM stage and GC location were also independent survival factors (HR=3.608; 95%CI [2.648â€“4.917] and HR=2.723; 95%CI [1.608â€“4.613]	 respectively). These results suggest that using a combination of this three-gene panel may function as a synergic biomarker set for predicting GC prognosis.  GFRA1	 SRF	 and ZNF382 expression changes in gastric carcinogenesis  The protein expression of the three genes in the paired GC and SM samples in both regular tissue sections and tissue microarray (TMA) were analyzed using the IHC assay as described in the supplementary methods (22). IHC analysis revealed that GFRA1 expression was predominantly observed in the cytoplasm of stromal cells	 especially in the vessel cells in GCs (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Among 38 pairs of IHC-informative cases	 the proportion of GCs with strong GFRA1-staining was significantly higher than SMs (24/38 vs. 12/38	 P<0.01). Among 28 pairs of informative cases	 the proportion of GCs with strong ZNF382-staining in epithelial cells was lower than SMs (4/28 vs. 11/28	 P<0.07) (Supplementary Fig. S5B). Statistically significant association was not observed between GFRA1 (or ZNF382) staining and clinical parameters	 such as invasion	 lymph metastasis	 embolus	 differentiation	 and overall survival. SRF-staining was only observed in the nucleus of some stromal fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells in both regular GC and SM sections (Supplementary Fig. S5C). Therefore	 SRF expression was not further examined using TMA.  Go to: Discussion Over a four-year period	 a comprehensive epigenetic biomarker discovery and validation study involving over 500 patient samples from three large academic medical centers in China	 Japan	 and Korea had been conducted. The biomarker discovery effort started off with a genome-wide analysis of differentially methylated genes between metastatic and non-metastatic GCs in a small number of patient samples. The microarray-based methylation profiling identified a large number of GC-specific and metastasis-specific candidate genes that were differentially methylated. From the list of differentially methylated genes	 a step-by-step elimination process identified a 15-gene panel associated with GC/metastasis-specific DNA methylation changes. The 15 genes were validated using multiple independent methods from a discovery cohort of GC patient samples. Finally	 a methylation biomarker-set consisting of GFRA1	 SRF	 and ZNF382 was validated for the prediction of GC metastasis and patientsâ€™ overall survival in four cohorts from China	 Japan	 and Korea. This novel epigenetic biomarker set may be used in the decision making process for personalized post-operational therapy. To our knowledge	 this is the first such study which specifically focuses on the metastasis of gastric cancer.  A large number of genome-wide DNA methylation studies have been reported for many different tumor types in recent years (6	10	 11). However	 most of the studies failed to perform large-scale and in-depth follow-up studies to validate the candidate genes discovered through the genome-wide analyses. As a result	 few methylation markers have been developed from the large number of DNA methylation studies published so far. The present study represents the most comprehensive and quantitative characterization of DNA methylation biomarkers in GC to date. Moreover	 the three methylation biomarkers associated with GC metastasis and patientsâ€™ survival were validated not only in multiple cohorts	 but also in freshly frozen and paraffin-embedded samples using several independent methods such as DHPLC and MethyLight. The vigorous testing performed in this study ensures the high reliability and feasibility of these novel biomarkers in different clinical settings.  It has been previously reported that 2	540 of 17	800 tested genes are differentially expressed between 80 pairs of GC and SM samples. Furthermore	 it was found that there are four times as many upregulated genes in GCs than there are downregulated genes (1983 vs. 557; GSE27342) (23). Therefore	 the frequent DNA hypomethylation in the promoter and exon-1 regions of the GC methylome observed in this study may account for the prevalent increase in gene expression. In fact	 an increasing number of studies have reported reactivation of proto-oncogenes by DNA hypomethylation in several cancers (24â€“26).  Long-range epigenetic silencing and large epigenetic structures have been reported in different cancers (27â€“29). Differential long-range hypermethylation and hypomethylation trends may be related to cancer/tissue-specific DNA methylation (11	 30). In the present study	 it was found that chromosomes 7	8	 and 20 appeared more favorable for long-range hypermethylation (or amplification of methylated-regions). In contrast	 chromosomes 3	4	14	15	 and 18 had an affinity for long-range hypomethylation (or deletion of methylated-regions). Further studies are warranted to determine which of these long-range hypermethylated and hypomethylated- regions are GC-specific changes and which are changes across cancer-types.  Most of the 15 aberrantly methylated genes identified in GCs are involved in cell proliferation	 differentiation	 apoptosis	 adhesion	 and embryonic development (Supplementary Table S2). Previous reports have demonstrated that silencing of BMP3	 BNIP3	 CDKN2A	 HOXD10	 TFPI2	 and ZNF382 via methylation correlates with both the development and progression of cancers (12	19	 31â€“34). Similar associations were also observed in GC samples used in the present study. Methylation changes of KCNH1	 PSMD10	 and SRF in cancer tissues have not previously been reported. Furthermore	 BNIP3	 KCNH1	 and ZNF382 methylation levels were more than 3-times higher in the GC samples than in SM and NorG samples. It is needed to study whether methylation of these genes may affect their expression states in gastric carcinogenesis. In addition	 though TBX5 and ELK1 methylation is not associated with GC metastasis	 the overall survival of GC patients with methylated TBX5 or ELK1 was longer than those without methylation (P=0.017 or 0.003; data not shown). Because some methylation changes may occur in both GC and SM samples from cancer patients	 more GC-related methylation changes could potentially be identified if the NorG samples were used as the normal stomach reference.  Among three genes identified with GC development- and metastasis-related methylation changes	 GFRA1 is a cell surface GDNF/neurturin receptor and a tyrosine kinase that is normally expressed in the nervous system and kidney. However	 this gene is over-expressed in gut neural crest stem cells and in many cancers (35â€“41). The present study provides the first evidence that hypomethylation of GFRA1 CGIs may account for its overexpression in cancers. SRF is a master regulator of myogenesis and multiple cellular processes including cell proliferation and migration. Furthermore	 SRF is known to play important roles in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and experimental invasion through cancer and stromal cells (42â€“48). The present study shows	 for the first time	 that methylation in the exon-1 region of its CGIs may epigenetically inactivate SRF transcription. Most importantly	 we found that SRF methylation was correlated with overall survival in non-cardiac GC patients	 but not in cardiac GC patients. It is well known that H. pylori infection increases risk of non-cardiac GC	 but not cardiac GC (49). The incidence of cardiac GC is also gradually increased in Western countries coincided with a decrease in prevalence of H. pylori infection	 (50). Therefore	 whether H. pylori infection contributes to SRF methylation and its biological subsequence warrants future study.  GFRA1 and SRF are two crucial genes in the GDNF-GFRA-RET-RAS-MEK-ERK-ELK-SRF pathway involved in cell migration and cancer invasion (37	41	 46â€“48). Therefore	 epigenetic alterations of GFRA1 and SRF may play important roles in GC metastasis through modulating this important pathway. ZNF382 is a candidate tumor suppressor gene	 and its methylation is associated with GC development (34). However	 its link with cancer metastasis has not previously been reported. In the present study	 it was found that the methylation status of GFRA1	 SRF or ZNF382 was consistently and significantly associated with GC metastasis and patientsâ€™ overall survival in multiple cohorts from different populations	 suggesting that they may be used as potential biomarkers for predicting GC metastasis and prognosis. Most importantly	 the combination of the three markers was not only identified as an independent survival factor	 but also as a strong synergistic biomarker set helping to distinguish metastatic GCs from non-metastatic GCs. The TMA analysis of GFRA1 and ZNF382 from 40 GC patients failed to demonstrate statistically significant association of their protein expression with clinicopathological parameters and overall survival of these patients; however	 up-regulation of GFRA1 protein and down-regulation of ZNF382 was indeed observed in the GCs compared to SMs	 which is in agreement with hypo- and hyper-methylation of GFRA1 and ZNF382 observed in GCs. Our results suggest that DNA methylation analysis mighty be a more suitable diagnostic tool than IHC for these genes. To further prove the clinical utility of this marker panel on early prediction for GC metastasis	 a prospective followup study among non-metastatic GC patients is being conducted.  In conclusion	 through a comprehensive and collaborative epigenetic biomarker discovery effort	 we have demonstrated that the DNA methylation changes of GFRA1	 SRF	 and ZNF382 were coordinately associated with GC metastasis and overall patient survival	 and this three gene panel has potential to be used as a synergistic biomarker set capable of improving the prognosis and treatment for GC patients.   Statement of translational relevance  Gastric carcinoma (GC) is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the world	 with many occurring in East Asia. To identify DNA methylation biomarkers for prediction of GC metastasis	 scientists and oncologists from China	 USA	 Japan	 and Korea have carried out a five-year collaborative study to profile differential methylation patterns in metastatic and non-metastatic GCs and perform an in-depth characterization of methylation changes in the CpG islands of 73 candidate genes. From this study	 we established a methylation biomarker-set composed of three genes GFRA1	 SRF	 and ZNF382 that could be used to synergistically predict GC metastasis and patientsâ€™ overall survival from multiple patient cohorts in China	 Japan	 and Korea. The established marker set will be a useful clinical tool for decision-making on personalized post-operational therapy that is currently not available.  STAT3 overactivation is a common event in many cancers	 including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)	 where STAT3 represents a promising therapeutic target. HNSCC is not characterized by frequent kinase mutations	 in contrast to some malignancies where mutational activation of kinases upstream of STAT3 is common. Instead	 STAT3 may be activated by loss-of-function (LOF) of negative regulators of STAT3	 including by promoter hypermethylation of PTPRT. Here we first analyzed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data and determined that the PTPRT promoter is frequently hypermethylated in several cancers	 including HNSCC (60.1% of tumors analyzed) in association with downregulation of PTPRT mRNA expression and upregulation of pSTAT3 expression. These findings were confirmed in an independent cohort of HNSCC tumors by methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and immunohistochemistry. We demonstrate that PTPRT promoter methylation and gene silencing is reversible in HNSCC cells	 leading to PTPRT-specific downregulation of pSTAT3 expression. We further show that PTPRT promoter methylation is significantly associated with sensitivity to STAT3 inhibition in HNSCC cells	 suggesting that PTPRT promoter methylation may serve as a predictive biomarker for responsiveness to STAT3 inhibitors in clinical development.  Keywords: head and neck cancer	 phosphatase	 methylation	 biomarker Go to: Introduction Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is an invasive malignancy with more than 40	000 expected diagnoses and more than 8	000 expected deaths in 2014 in the United States alone. 1 Most cancers	 including HNSCC	 are characterized by constitutive activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) via phosphorylation of tyrosine 705 (Y705). STAT3 is a transcription factor and potent oncoprotein that activates or maintains many cancer phenotypes including abnormal growth	 proliferation	 angiogenesis	 and invasion as well as evasion of apoptosis and the anti-tumor immune response. 2 While aberrant activation of kinases upstream of STAT3 likely contributes to constitutive activation of STAT3 in cancer	 the role of loss-of-function (LOF) of downstream regulators	 especially protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs)	 remains incompletely understood.  The PTP superfamily is a large group of enzymes that	 in close coordination with tyrosine kinases	 tightly regulates diverse signaling pathways by catalyzing the removal of a phosphate group from specific signaling proteins. The largest class of PTPs in the human genome is comprised of the receptor-like PTP (PTPR) family	 which contains 21 distinct members. PTPR family members span the membrane once and contain one or two intracellular catalytic domains	 as well as a modular extracellular region that typically contains several protein-protein interaction domains. A role for PTPRs in the context of cancer is increasingly apparent	 with many members implicated as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. 3 We recently reported that members of the PTPR family are frequently somatically mutated across all solid tumors analyzed	 including HNSCC	 with PTPR type T (PTPRT) representing the single most commonly mutated PTP in HNSCC and across all cancers. 4 Importantly	 pSTAT3 is a validated direct substrate of PTPRT	 and LOF mutations of PTPRT lead to increased pSTAT3 expression and enhanced HNSCC cell growth/survival. 4	 5 As these LOF PTPRT mutations are found in relatively few HNSCC tumors (5.6% of tumors analyzed)	 we sought to determine if loss of PTPRT expression by aberrant promoter methylation contributes to pSTAT3 overexpression and sensitivity to STAT3 inhibition in HNSCC.  Herein	 we report a high frequency of aberrant PTPRT promoter hypermethylation in HNSCC and other cancers. We demonstrate that PTPRT promoter methylation significantly downregulates PTPRT expression	 with an associated increase in expression of the PTPRT substrate pSTAT3 in HNSCC. We show that this methylation is reversible	 leading to specific downregulation of pSTAT3 in HNSCC cells. Further	 we demonstrate a correlation between PTPRT promoter methylation and sensitivity to STAT3 inhibition in HNSCC cell lines	 suggesting that PTPRT methylation may serve as a predictive biomarker of responsiveness to STAT3 inhibitors currently in clinical development.  Go to: Results Frequent PTPRT promoter hypermethylation leads to decreased PTPRT mRNA expression  To assess aberrant PTPRT promoter methylation in HNSCC	 we analyzed TCGA data derived from the Illumina HumanMethylation450 platform. We first determined which CG dinucleotide methylation event was most negatively correlated with PTPRT mRNA expression (Figure 1A). We then defined aberrant hypermethylation as a fractional methylation level (beta value) at least three standard deviations above the mean methylation level of the same genetic locus in organ-matched normal tissue samples and found that 60.1% (256/426 tumors analyzed) of HNSCC tumors were hypermethylated (Figure 1B). By this stringent measure	 hypermethylated tumors exhibit significantly decreased PTPRT mRNA expression levels as determined by RNA-Seq (Figure 1C)	 suggesting the validity of the above definition and that PTPRT hypermethylation has the expected biologic effect. In contrast	 copy number alterations of the PTPRT gene are relatively infrequent and are not significantly associated with altered PTPRT mRNA expression (Supplemental Figure 1). As human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is an etiologic and prognostic factor in a subset of HNSCC	 we sought to determine if PTPRT promoter hypermethylation is associated with HPV status and observed no significant association (P = 1.00	 Fisherâ€™s exact test; PTPRT promoter hypermethylation in 21/36 [58.3%] HPV-positive tumors versus 145/243 [59.7%] HPV-negative tumors)	 suggesting that HPV infection is not a driver of PTPRT promoter methylation. 6  Figure 1 Figure 1 Frequent PTPRT promoter hypermethylation is associated with downregulation of PTPRT mRNA in HNSCC tumors In order to validate TCGA findings in an independent HNSCC human cohort	 we performed methylation-specific PCR (MSP) on 45 formalin-fixed	 paraffin-embedded oral squamous cell cancers with primers directed at the promoter region of PTPRT (representative analysis in Figure 2A). Using this semi-quantitative analysis	 a similar high frequency of methylation was observed in this cohort (71.1%	 32/45 tumors analyzed; Figure 2B)	 further suggesting that PTPRT promoter methylation represents a common mechanism of PTPRT downregulation in HNSCC.  Figure 2 Figure 2 The PTPRT promoter is frequently methylated in an independent cohort of HNSCC tumors The PTPRT promoter is frequently hypermethylated across human cancers  Further analysis of TCGA data reveals that the PTPRT promoter is frequently hypermethylated across a broad array of cancer types when hypermethylation is defined as a fractional methylation level (beta value) at least three standard deviations above the mean methylation level of the same genetic locus in organ-matched normal tissue samples. The highest incidence of PTPRT promoter hypermethylation occurs in colon adenocarcinoma (78.7%	 289/367 tumors analyzed)	 while HNSCC exhibits the second highest incidence (60.1%) (Figure 3A). Of the cancers analyzed	 four exhibit significant downregulation of PTPRT mRNA in hypermethylated tumors (HNSCC	 colon adenocarcinoma	 lung adenocarcinoma	 and breast invasive carcinoma; P < 0.05)	 suggesting a functional role for aberrant PTPRT promoter methylation across several cancer types (Figure 3B).  Figure 3 Figure 3 The PTPRT promoter is frequently hypermethylated across cancer types in association with downregulated PTPRT mRNA PTPRT expression is inversely associated with STAT3 activation in HNSCC  Additional analysis of TCGA data indicates that PTPRT mRNA expression is inversely correlated with pSTAT3 expression as determined by reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) (Figure 4A). Since pSTAT3 is known to be a direct substrate of PTPRT	 we hypothesized that PTPRT promoter methylation may contribute to increased STAT3 activation. 5 Indeed	 representative immunohistochemical staining of an independent cohort of HNSCC tumors demonstrated that those with PTPRT promoter methylation	 as determined by MSP	 express elevated levels of pSTAT3 relative to tumors without PTPRT methylation (Figure 4B). Together	 these findings suggest that PTPRT promoter methylation may be a frequent mechanism that contributes to STAT3 activation in HNSCC.  Figure 4 Figure 4 PTPRT promoter methylation and mRNA expression are associated with pSTAT3 expression PTPRT promoter methylation is reversible	 leading to PTPRT-specific pSTAT3 downregulation  To further investigate the association between PTPRT promoter methylation and STAT3 activation	 we selected a HNSCC cell line (Cal27) that exhibits nearly complete methylation as determined by MSP. Treatment of Cal27 cells with 5-azacytidine (5-aza)	 a non-specific DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor	 led to an increase in the unmethylated signal as determined by MSP (Figure 5A)	 concurrent with overexpression of endogenous wild-type PTPRT and downregulation of pSTAT3 expression (Figures 5B and 5C). Transfection of Cal27 cells with shRNA directed against PTPRT (shPTPRT) following 5-aza treatment also resulted in an increase in the unmethylated signal (Figure 5A)	 but the expression of PTPRT was significantly downregulated relative to 5-aza treatment alone. Further	 pSTAT3 expression remained unaffected under these conditions (Figures 5B and 5C)	 suggesting that 5-aza-mediated downregulation of pSTAT3 is dependent upon demethylation and re-expression of PTPRT in these cells. These results provide mechanistic evidence that PTPRT promoter methylation contributes directly to STAT3 activation in HNSCC by downregulation of PTPRT expression.  Figure 5 Figure 5 PTPRT promoter methylation is reduced by 5-azacytidine treatment	 leading to PTPRT-specific pSTAT3 downregulation in HNSCC cells PTPRT promoter methylation is associated with increased sensitivity to STAT3 inhibition in HNSCC cells  To evaluate whether PTPRT promoter methylation may serve as a predictive biomarker for STAT3 targeted therapies	 we first determined EC50 values for selective STAT3 inhibitors in a panel of 8 HNSCC cell lines (Figures 6A and 6B) that exhibit varying levels of PTPRT promoter methylation as determined by MSP (summarized in Figures 6C and 6D). Figures 6E and 6F illustrate that PTPRT promoter methylation and sensitivity to Stattic (a STAT3 SH2 domain inhibitor) or JSI-124 (a JAK/STAT3 pathway inhibitor) are significantly correlated (P < 0.05)	 indicating that HNSCC tumors that exhibit PTPRT promoter hypermethylation may be most sensitive to treatment with STAT3 inhibitors. A similar trend was observed with the JAK2 inhibitor LY2784544	 though this observation was not statistically significant (Supplemental Figure 2). Notably	 we observe no direct correlation between PTPRT promoter methylation and pSTAT3 expression in this cell line panel	 suggesting that high pSTAT3 expression per se may not be predictive of sensitivity to STAT3 inhibitors. Thus	 inhibition of STAT3 directly rather than through upstream kinases may be more efficacious in tumors with PTPRT promoter hypermethylation.  Figure 6 Figure 6 Increased PTPRT promoter methylation is associated with increased sensitivity to STAT3 inhibition We next sought to determine whether PTPRT methylation may serve as a predictive biomarker of sensitivity to STAT3 inhibition in a heterotopic tumorgraft model of HNSCC. We inoculated 16 nude mice with 3Ã—106 BICR 18 cells (which exhibit total PTPRT unmethylation) on one flank	 and 3Ã—106 UMSCC 1 cells (which exhibit near total PTPRT methylation) on the other flank. After 10 days	 the unmethylated cells had not formed any tumors	 while the methylated cells had formed palpable masses in 15/16 mice (mean volume = 100.3 mm3). As BICR 18 cells are the only HNSCC cells identified to date with total (or near total) PTPRT unmethylation	 we are therefore unable to determine the relative sensitivities of unmethylated versus methylated HNSCC cells in vivo. Nevertheless	 starting on day 10 post-inoculation	 8 mice were randomized to receive 50 mg/kg Stattic by oral gavage five times per week	 with serial tumor measurements performed three times per week. After 9 days of treatment	 a large and statistically significant (P < 0.01) reduction in tumor volume was observed in the Stattic treatment arm relative to the no treatment group (Supplemental Figure 3)	 confirming that a PTPRT-methylated HNSCC heterotopic tumorgraft is indeed sensitive to STAT3 inhibition in vivo.  Go to: Discussion The survival rate for HNSCC patients has remained stagnant in recent decades despite advances in the understanding of the biological underpinnings of this disease and improved therapeutic strategies. In 2006	 the Food and Drug Administration approved cetuximab	 a monoclonal antibody targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)	 for the treatment of HNSCC patients. 7 Unfortunately	 cetuximab has produced limited success in the clinic	 at least in part due to the lack of predictive biomarkers	 including EGFR expression or copy number gain. 8 There is therefore a need for the identification of both novel targets for pharmacologic inhibition and biomarkers for sensitivity to emerging therapeutics. STAT3 is a promising target for pharmacologic inhibition	 and STAT3 inhibitors are being tested in early phase clinical trials. 2 We previously reported that STAT3 activation contributed to cetuximab resistance in HNSCC preclinical models and tumors from patients treated on cetuximab-containing protocols. 9 It is increasingly apparent that most molecular targeted agents will be most effective in subgroups of patients identified by specific genomic/transcriptomic/proteomic characteristics. The identification of biomarkers that identify those individuals most likely to benefit from these agents would allow the design of more scientifically rational clinical trials.  Here we report that the PTPRT promoter is frequently hypermethylated in HNSCC and other cancers in association with decreased PTPRT expression. A high rate of PTPRT promoter hypermethylation has also been reported in sporadic colorectal cancer	 where nearly all tumors analyzed were methylated in contrast to no observed methylation in matched normal tissues	 as well as in hepatocellular carcinoma	 where the PTPRT methylation levels progressively increase from adjacent tissue to tumor. 10	 11 Our present findings indicate that PTPRT promoter methylation may represent a common event across many cancer types	 suggesting that the development of a therapeutic strategy informed by this event may be of wide clinical benefit.  To date	 the functional signaling consequences downstream of PTPRT promoter methylation have not been described	 and as such	 no strategies to mitigate the effects of this event have been proposed. Here we demonstrate that PTPRT promoter methylation is associated with a decrease in PTPRT mRNA expression	 which in turn is associated with an increase in expression of the PTPRT substrate pSTAT3. We further evaluated PTPRT promoter methylation in an independent cohort of HNSCC and observed a similar frequency to that observed by TCGA	 thus confirming the high incidence of this event. We also confirm that PTPRT methylation significantly contributes to pSTAT3 upregulation in HNSCC cells. Together	 these studies suggest that HNSCC cells and tumors that exhibit high levels of PTPRT promoter methylation may be more dependent on STAT3 signaling for growth and survival	 thus offering the opportunity to exploit PTPRT methylation as a predictive biomarker of sensitivity to STAT3 inhibition. Importantly	 we have established an association between PTPRT promoter methylation and sensitivity to inhibitors of the STAT3 signaling pathway. These studies therefore suggest that screening for PTPRT promoter methylation may ultimately allow the identification of patients who are most likely to benefit from treatment with STAT3 targeting agents and provide a rationale for designing future clinical trials that select for patients with a high degree of PTPRT promoter methylation.   The activity of phosphatases could be influenced by genetic	 as well as epigenetic alterations. In our study	 we have investigated the methylation status of four PTPRs: PTPRM	 PTPRT	 PTPRR and PTPRZ1	 which were pre-selected using microarray techniques as being alternatively methylated in sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC). The analyses were carried out on 131 surgical specimens obtained from sporadic CRC patients. The methylation status of the four genes was examined using methyl specific PCR (MSP). The analysis of promoter methylation using an Illumina 27K microarray revealed four protein tyrosine phosphatases PTPRM	 PTPRT	 PTPRR and PTPRZ1 as being hypermethylated with Î²-value â‰¥0.2 and Pâ‰¤0.05. Subsequent analysis using MSP confirmed these observations-the frequency of promoter methylation was significantly higher in tumor cells compared with matched normal tissue for each of the analyzed genes. There was no association observed between the methylation status of PTPRs and either CIMP	 K-ras (codon 12) and BRAF (exon 15	 V600E) mutations or tumor localization (proximal/distal). The results of our study show a statistically significant difference between promoter methylation in cancerous and healthy tissue. This result supports the hypothesis that the PTPR family has an important role in the etiology of CRC.

4	49||Tyrosine phosphorylation	 regulated by protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) and kinases (PTKs)	 is important in signaling pathways underlying tumorigenesis. A mutational analysis of the tyrosine phosphatase gene superfamily in human cancers identified 83 somatic mutations in six PTPs (PTPRF	 PTPRG	 PTPRT	 PTPN3	 PTPN13	 PTPN14)	 affecting 26% of colorectal cancers and a smaller fraction of lung	 breast	 and gastric cancers. Fifteen mutations were nonsense	 frameshift	 or splice-site alterations predicted to result in truncated proteins lacking phosphatase activity. Five missense mutations in the most commonly altered PTP (PTPRT) were biochemically examined and found to reduce phosphatase activity. Expression of wild-type but not a mutant PTPRT in human cancer cells inhibited cell growth. These observations suggest that the mutated tyrosine phosphatases are tumor suppressor genes	 regulating cellular pathways that may be amenable to therapeutic intervention. Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues is a central feature of many cellular signaling pathways	 including those affecting growth	 differentiation	 cell cycle regulation	 apoptosis	 and invasion (1	 2). This phosphorylation is coordinately controlled by protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and phosphatases (PTPs). Although a variety of PTK genes have been directly linked to tumorigenesis through somatic activating mutations (3â€“6)	 only a few PTP genes have been implicated in cancer (7â€“10). Moreover	 it is not known how many or how frequently members of the PTP gene family are altered in any particular cancer type. We have systematically addressed these issues by comprehensive mutational analysis of the PTP gene superfamily in colorectal tumors.  The PTP gene superfamily is composed of three main families: (i) the classical PTPs	 including the receptor PTPs (RPTPs) and the nonreceptor PTPs (NRPTPs); (ii) the dual specificity phosphatases (DSPs)	 which can dephosphorylate serine and threonine in addition to tyrosine residues; and (iii) the low molecular weight phosphatases (LMPs) (1). Using an approach similar to that described in a recent bioinformatic analysis of PTPs in the mouse genome (11)	 we employed a combination of Hidden Markov Models representing catalytic domains of members of the PTP superfamily to identify 53 classical PTPs (21 RPTPs and 32 NRPTPs)	 33 DSPs	 and one LMP in the human genome (12). This analysis revealed a set of genes representing all known human PTPs (13) as well as seven putative PTPs.  As an initial screen to evaluate whether these phosphatases are genetically altered in human cancer	 we analyzed the coding exons of all 87 members of this gene superfamily in 18 colorectal cancers. A total of 1375 exons from all annotated RPTPs	 NRPTPs	 DSPs	 and LMPs were extracted from genomic databases (12). These exons were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from cancer genomic DNA samples and directly sequenced with dye terminator chemistry (12). Whenever a presumptive mutation was identified	 we attempted to determine whether it was somatically acquired (i.e.	 tumor specific) by examining the sequence of the gene in genomic DNA from normal tissue of the relevant patient.  From the 3.3 Mb of sequence information obtained	 we identified six genes containing somatic mutations	 including three members of the RPTP subfamily (PTPRF	 PTPRG	 and PTPRT) and three members of the NRPTP subfamily (PTPN3	 PTPN13	 and PTPN14). These six genes were then further analyzed for mutations in another 157 colorectal cancers. Through this strategy	 we identified 77 mutations in the six genes	 in aggregate affecting 26% of the colorectal tumors analyzed (table S1 and Fig. 1). Examination of these six genes in seven other tumor types identified PTPRT mutations in two of 11 (18%) lung cancers and two of 12 gastric cancers (17%)	 and PTPRF mutations in one of 11 (9%) lung cancers and one of 11 (9%) breast cancers. No mutations were identified in 12 pancreatic cancers	 12 ovarian cancers	 12 medulloblastomas	 or 12 glioblastomas (table S1 and Fig. 1). In total	 83 nonsynonymous mutations were observed	 all of which were somatic in the cancers that could be assessed (12).    Download high-res image  Open in new tab  Download Powerpoint Fig. 1.

Black stars indicate PTPRT mutants evaluated for phosphatase activity (Fig. 2)	 and the red star indicates PTPRT mutant evaluated for effects on cell proliferation (Fig. 3).  Fifteen of the 83 mutations were nonsense	 frameshift	 or splice-site alterations	 all of which were predicted to result in aberrant or truncated proteins. In 16 tumors both alleles of the phosphatase gene appeared to be mutated	 a characteristic often associated with tumor suppressor genes. The majority of tumors with PTP gene mutations also contained mutations in KRAS or BRAF	 and nine tumors contained alterations in previously reported tyrosine kinase genes (table S1). Thus	 the mutant phosphatases identified in this study are likely to operate through cellular pathways distinct from those associated with previously identified mutant kinases.  Analysis of mutations in tumors is complicated by the fact that mutations can arise either as functional alterations affecting key genes underlying the neoplastic process or as nonfunctional â€œpassengerâ€ changes. The multiple waves of clonal expansion and selection that occur throughout tumorigenesis lead to fixation of any mutation that had previously occurred in any predecessor cell	 regardless of whether the mutation was actually responsible for the clonal expansion. Two independent lines of evidence suggest that the sequence alterations we observed are functional. First	 the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations provides an indication of selection	 as synonymous alterations usually do not exert a growth advantage. There were no somatic synonymous mutations detected in the colorectal cancers analyzed	 resulting in a ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations of 77 to 0	 much higher than the expected 2:1 ratio for nonselected passenger mutations (P < 1 Ã— 10â€“6). Second	 the prevalence of mutations in the coding regions of the analyzed genes was âˆ¼19 per Mb of tumor DNA	 similar to the prevalence of functional somatic alterations observed in other gene families [e.g.	 the tyrosine kinome (6)] and significantly higher than the prevalence of nonfunctional alterations previously observed in the cancer genomes (âˆ¼1 per Mb	 P < 0.01) (14). These data support the idea that these mutations were the targets of selection during tumorigenesis.  The great majority of the nonsense and frameshift mutations (Fig. 1) would result in polypeptides devoid of C-terminal phosphatase catalytic domains	 thereby leading to inactivation of the phosphatase. To evaluate whether tumor-specific point mutations alter phosphatase activity	 we biochemically tested mutant versions of PTPRT	 the most frequently mutated PTP in the superfamily. Mutations in both intracellular PTP domains (D1 and D2) were evaluated. His-tagged versions of the catalytic region of wild-type PTPRT	 two D1 mutants (Q987K and N1128I)	 and three D2 mutants (R1212W	 R1346L	 and T1368M) were produced in bacteria and analyzed for phosphatase activity by using 6	8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (DiFMUP) as a substrate (Fig. 2) (12). All D1 and D2 mutants had reduced phosphatase activity compared with the wild-type protein (Fig. 2). The kinetic parameter Kcat was reduced in both D1 mutants	 while Km was increased in all three D2 mutants	 suggesting that mutations in the two domains may have different effects on enzymatic activity. Although it has been thought that the D2 domain is usually catalytically inactive (1)	 our results are consistent with recent studies that show that the D2 domain is important for phosphatase activity in some receptor phosphatases (15).    Download high-res image  Open in new tab  Download Powerpoint Fig. 2. Evaluation of phosphatase activity of mutant PTPRT. (A) Saturation kinetics of wild-type and mutant PTPRT. His-tagged versions of PTPRT protein segments comprising the two catalytic domains containing wild-type (WT) and tumor-specific mutant sequences were expressed in bacteria and purified using nickelaffinity chromatography. Equal amounts of WT and mutant proteins were used to evaluate enzyme kinetics. The rate of hydrolysis of substrate (DiFMUP) is plotted against increasing substrate concentration. Data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menton equation	 and the resulting kinetic parameters of WT and mutant proteins are indicated in (B).  These biochemical data on missense mutations	 coupled with the large number of truncating mutations	 suggested that PTPRT functions as a tumor suppressor gene. To determine whether PTPRT expression can inhibit tumor cell growth	 we transfected wild-type PTPRT into HCT116 colorectal cancer cells (12). An identical expression vector containing an R632X mutant of PTPRT was used for comparison. Wild-type PTPRT potently inhibited cell growth in this assay	 as seen by the substantial decrease in the number of neomycin-resistant colonies compared with the R632X mutant or with vector alone (Fig. 3	 A and B). Similar results with wild-type and mutant PTPRT were also observed in DLD1 colorectal cancer cells.    Download high-res image  Open in new tab  Download Powerpoint Fig. 3.

The photographs show colonies stained with crystal violet after 14 days of geneticin selection. (B) Number of resistant colonies (mean of two 25 cm2 flasks) for WT PTPRT	 mutant PTPRT	 and empty vector.  The combination of these genetic	 biochemical	 and cellular data suggest that PTPRT and the other identified phosphatases are likely to act as tumor suppressors. This is consistent with the function of other phosphatases implicated in tumorigenesis (7	8	 16) and with the general role of phosphatases in inhibiting various growth-promoting signaling pathways (2). The absence of biallelic mutations in a subset of the analyzed tumors suggests that some alterations may act in a dominant-negative fashion or may affect gene dosage	 mechanisms that have been previously involved in inactivation of other tumor suppressor genes (17	 18).  Little is known about the functional role of the tyrosine phosphatases discussed here. PTPN13 appears to be involved in apoptosis (19) and may be partly responsible for the antitumor effects of tamoxifen (20). Overexpression of PTPN3 inhibits growth of NIH/3T3 cells	 possibly through interaction with valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97) (21). PTPN14 and PTPRF are thought to play a role in cell adhesion by regulating tyrosine phosphorylation of adherens junction proteins (22	 23). Because increased phosphorylation of adherens junctions has been shown to increase cell motility and migration (22	 24)	 mutational inactivation of these genes may be an important step in cancer cell invasion and metastasis. PTPRG maps to chromosome 3p14.2	 a region frequently lost in lung	 renal	 and early-stage breast tumors	 and is thought to be a target of the translocation at 3p14 in familial renal cell carcinoma (25â€“27). However	 no point mutations in PTPRG (28) or any of the other genes identified here have been previously described in any cancer. PTPRT is expressed in the developing central nervous system and in the adult cerebellum (29) and had not been thought to play a role in the growth or differentiation of other tissues. We have found that PTPRT is expressed in a variety of human tissues	 including normal colon epithelium as well as cells derived from colorectal cancers (fig. S1).  Phosphatases affect signaling pathways that may be amenable to therapeutic intervention in cancer cells (2). Although reactivation of incapacitated phosphatases is likely to be pharmacologically challenging	 identification of the corresponding kinases that phosphorylate substrates normally regulated by the mutant phosphatases could provide novel therapeutic targets. Like the analysis of genetic alterations in tyrosine kinases (6)	 the present study suggests the possibility of individualized therapy based on the mutant phosphatases present in specific tumors. Conceivably	 this approach would have broad therapeutic use	 because more than 50% of colorectal tumors analyzed to date have alterations in at least one member of the tyrosine phosphatome or kinome. 																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							
1	50||Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase T (PTPRT/PTPÏ) is frequently mutated in human cancers including colon	 lung	 gastric and skin cancers. More than half of the identified tumor-derived mutations are located in the extracellular part of PTPÏ. However	 the functional significance of those extracellular domain mutations remains to be defined. Here we report that the extracellular domain of PTPÏ mediates homophilic cell-cell aggregation. This homophilic interaction is very specific	 as PTPÏ does not interact with its closest homolog PTPÎ¼ in a cell aggregation assay. We further demonstrated that all 5 tumor-derived mutations located in the N-terminal MAM and Ig domains impair	 to varying extents	 their ability to from cell aggregates	 indicating that those mutations are loss-of-function mutations. Our results suggest that PTPÏ may play an important role in cell-cell adhesion and mutational inactivation of this phosphatase could promote tumor migration and metastasis.  Go to: Introduction Tyrosine phosphorylation is coordinately controlled by protein tyrosine kinases and phosphatases and is a central feature of many signaling pathways involved in tumor development (1). While activating mutations in protein tyrosine kinases have been shown to play vital roles in tumorigenesis (1)	 the role of phosphatases is less well-defined. We recently identified PTPRT	 also known as PTPÏ	 as the most frequently mutated PTP gene in colorectal cancers (CRCs) (2). PTPRT was also mutationally altered in lung	 gastric cancers and melanomas (2). The spectrum of mutations	 which included nonsense mutations and frameshifts	 suggested that these mutations were inactivating (2). Biochemical analyses demonstrated that missense mutations in the catalytic domains of PTPÏ diminished its phosphatase activity and overexpression of PTPÏ inhibited CRC cell growth (2). Taken together	 these studies strongly supported the notion that PTPÏ normally acts as a tumor suppressor gene. This conclusion was also supported by a transposon-based somatic mutagenesis screen in mice	 wherein PTPÏ was isolated as a target gene from two different mouse transgenic sarcomas (3).  PTPRT (PTPÏ) is a member of the type IIB receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) subfamily (4). Other members of this subfamily include PTPRM (PTPÎ¼)	 PTPRK (PTPÎº) and PCP2 (also called PTPÎ»	 PTPÏˆ	 PTPRO-omicron	 PTPÏ€	 hPTP-J) (5). These 4 RPTPs share the same domain structure: an extracelluar domain	 a juxtamembrane region and two phosphatase domains (6). The extracellular domains of type IIB RPTPs have high sequence identities (7	 8)	 all consist of a MAM (memprin/A5/PTPÎ¼) domain	 an Ig domain	 and four fibronectin type III (FNIII) repeats (6). The MAM domain is suggested to play a role in protein dimerization (6). The Ig domain is a disulfide structure that is found in many cell surface proteins and has been shown to mediate homophilic and heterophilic interactions between cell adhesion molecules (6). The FNIII motif was originally identified in the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin and later found to be present in many immunoglobulin superfamily cell adhesion molecules (6). We have identified ~15 somatic mutations that are localized in the extracellular domain of PTPRT/PTPÏ. How these mutations affect the functions of PTPÏ remains to be determined.  Three close homologs of PTPÏ	 PTPÎ¼	 PTPÎº and PTPÎ» (PCP-2)	 are known to mediate homophilic cell-cell adhesion (9â€“ 12). Expression of the full-length PTPÎ¼ (9) (10) or a construct encoding the extracellular	 transmembrane and 55 amino acids of the juxtamembrane domain of PTPÎ¼ in non-adhesive Sf9 insect cells induces cell aggregation (9). Furthermore	 homophilic binding of PTPÎ¼ was demonstrated between PTPÎ¼-coated fluorescent beads and cells that endogenously express PTPÎ¼ (9). The minimal region required for homophilic binding was mapped to the Ig domain of PTPÎ¼ (13). In addition	 the Ig domain is required for proper cell surface localization (14). However	 assays that test cell-cell aggregation demonstrate that the MAM and Ig domains as well as the first two fibronectin type III repeats are required for efficient cell-cell aggregation (15â€“ 18). Similarly	 PTPÎº was also demonstrated to mediate homophilic cell-cell aggregation (11). Here we report that PTPRT (PTPÏ)	 like its homologs	 mediates homophilic cell-cell aggregation in Sf9 cells. Most importantly	 the tumor-derived mutations located in the MAM and Ig domains are defective in this cell-cell adhesion function.  Go to: Results The extracellular domain of PTPÏ mediates cell-cell aggregation in Sf9 cells  To test whether PTPÏ mediates homophilic cell-cell adhesion	 we made the following PTPÏ baculoviral constructs expressing: (1) full-length PTPÏ; (2) the intracellular fragment of PTPÏ (Intra); (3) the extracellular fragment of PTPÏ with its transmembrane domain (Extra-TM); (4) the extracellular fragment of PTPÏ with its transmembrane	 juxtamembrane and wedge domains (Extra-JMD-W); (5) a chimera containing the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the EGF receptor and the intracellular PTP domains of PTPÏ (Fig. 1A). All of those fragments were tagged with V5 epitope tags. Proteins of the expected size were expressed in Sf9 cells infected with those baculoviral constructs (Fig. 1B). All of these proteins	 but the intracellular PTPÏ	 were expressed on the surface on Sf9 cells (Fig. 1C). To test whether these PTPÏ recombinant proteins mediate cell-cell adhesion	 a cell aggregation assay was performed following the procedure of Brady-Kalnay et al (9). Sf9 cells infected with a baculovirus encoding PTPÎ¼	 which was previously demonstrated to mediate cell-cell aggregation	 were treated in parallel as a positive control (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig 2	 the non-adhesive Sf9 cells expressing either the full-length PTPÏ or PTPÏ-JMD-W formed cell aggregates. On the contrary	 Sf9 cells expressing either the intracellular fragments of PTPÏ or the EGFR/PTPÏ chimeras remained as a suspension of single cells (Fig 1C). These results indicate that the extracullar fragment of PTPÏ play an important role in mediating cell-cell aggregation and the phosphatase activity of PTPÏ is not required for this function. Surprisingly	 although the construct that encodes the PTPÏ extracellular fragment with the transmembrane domain sequences only (Extra-TM) was expressed on the cell surface (see Figure 7)	 this protein failed to mediate cell aggregation of Sf9 cells	 suggesting that additional juxtamembrane sequences are required for either forming or stablizing the cell aggregates.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Expression of PTPÏ constructs in Sf9 cells Figure 2 Figure 2 PTPÏ mediates cell-cell aggregation Figure 7 Figure 7 Cell Surface Protein expression of PTPÎ¼ and the PTPÏ mutant proteins PTPÏ mediates highly specific homophilic cell-cell aggregation  To test whether PTPÏ mediates homophilic cell-cell aggregation	 one set of Sf9 cells were infected with virus expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and another set of Sf9 cells were co-infected with viruses expressing either the full-length PTPÏ or red fluorescent protein (RFP). The GFP expressing cells were mixed with equal number cells expressing full-length PTPÏ (co-expressing RFP) and the aggregation assays were performed. As shown in Fig 3A	 the GFP labeled cells did not aggregate and did not contribute to the aggregates formed by cells expressing full-length PTPÏ (RFP). These results strongly suggest that the aggregation of Sf9 cells expressing PTPÏ is mediated through a homophilic interaction among PTPÏ molecules in trans	 but not through a heterophilic interaction between molecules expressed on the surface of Sf9 cells. Interestingly	 the homophilic interaction of PTPÏ is very specific. Although 63% of the amino acid sequences of the extracellular domain of PTPÏ are identical with that of PTPRM (PTPÎ¼)	 Sf9 cells expressing PTPÏ (co-expressing RFP) did not aggregate with PTPÎ¼ expressing cells (co-expressing GFP) as shown in Fig. 3B.  Figure 3 Figure 3 PTPÏ mediates homophilic cell-cell aggregation The tumor-derived PTPRT/PTPÏ mutations in the MAM and Ig domains are defective in cell-cell aggregation  Several studies demonstrated that the MAM and Ig domains as well as the first two FNIII repeats of PTPÎ¼ are the minimal essential regions required for its homophilic interaction (13	15	17	 18). We identified 5 tumor-specific mutations that are located in the two domains (2). Among these five mutations	 the F74S mutation is located in the MAM domain and the other four mutations (A209T	 K218T	 F248S and Y280H) are located in the Ig domain (Fig. 4A). To test whether these mutations affect their ability to mediate cell-cell aggregation in Sf9 cells	 we engineered the five mutations by site-directed mutagenesis using the full-length PTPÏ baculoviral construct as the template. The five mutant proteins are expressed at the expected size and at similar levels to wild-type PTPÏ on a western blot (Fig. 4B)	 indicating that these mutations do not affect their protein stability. None of these mutations significantly alter their cell surface expression	 as all five mutant PTPÏ proteins showed strong plasma membrane staining (Fig. 4C and Fig. 7). However	 as shown in Fig. 5	 all mutant PTPÏ proteins formed smaller aggregates than that of the wild-type PTPÏ protein. To quantify the cells aggregates	 percentage of cells that are incorporate into > 5-cell clusters were counted (as described in the material and methods section). As shown in Fig. 5	 Sf9 cells expressing all the mutants formed significantly less aggregates than that of cells expressing wild-type PTPÏ. The deletion construct of PTPÏ lacking the two phosphatase domains (PTPÏ Extra-JMD-W) and the K218T mutant exhibited similar levels of aggregation that were statistically less than wild-type PTPÏ (p < 0.01). Taken together	 our data demonstrated that the five tumor-derived mutations located the MAM and Ig domains of PTPÏ are deficient in cell-cell adhesion. Therefore	 these mutations exhibit varying degrees of loss-of-function in cell adhesion.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Expression of tumor-derived PTPÏ mutants in Sf9 cells Figure 5 Figure 5 Tumor-derived mutations of PTPÏ are defective in cell-cell aggregation Mechanistically	 the defect of the PTPÏ mutations in cell-cell adhesion could be resulted from either impaired ability in homophilic binding or reduced cell surface expression. Although immunofluorescent staining indicated that those mutations do not alter cell surface expression qualitatively	 it is imperative to quantify cell surface expression of mutant PTPÏ proteins. As described in detail in the method section	 baculovirus-infected Sf9 cell surface proteins were labeled with Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin and isolated on immobilized NeutrAvidin Gel. Western blots were performed with antibodies to PTPÎ¼ (SK18) or the V5 tag. The SK18 antibody recognizes the cytoplasmic domain of both PTPÎ¼ and PTPÏ. The results shown in Fig. 7 demonstrate that full length PTPÎ¼ and the wild-type	 mutant and deleted PTPÏ proteins were expressed at the cell surface. As a control for a non-cell surface protein	 the cytoplasmic intracellular domain of PTPÎ¼ (PTPÎ¼-intra) was expressed that is detected by SK18 (9). PTPÎ¼ intra does not contain an extracellular domain and therefore is not biotinylated nor precipitated by the NeutrAvidin gel (Fig. 7). Quantitatively	 the levels of cell surface expression of the 5 tumor-derived PTPÏ mutations were similar to that of wild-type protein. If the cell surface expression level (CSE value) of wild-type PTPÏ is arbitrarily assigned as 1	 the CSE values of F74S	 A209T	 K218T	 F248S and Y280H mutations were 2.3	1.1	1.6	 0.6 and 0.8 respectively. Interestingly	 some PTPÏ mutants that contain the extracellular domain but are unable to mediate cell-cell aggregation are expressed at higher levels on the Sf9 cell surface than wild-type PTPÏ. These results suggest that defect of PTPÏ mutation in cell-cell adhesion is mainly due to reduced homophilic binding affinity of the mutant proteins. Interestingly	 the cell surface expression levels PTPÏ Extra-TM (CSE value = 27) and PTPÏ Extra-JMD-W (CSE value = 20) were much higher than that of full-length protein for unknown reasons.  Go to: Discussion We demonstrated that PTPRT/PTPÏ meditates homophilic cell-cell aggregation and five tumor-derived mutations located in the MAM and Ig domains impair this function. Our results strongly suggest that those PTPÏ loss-of-function mutations are selected for during the process of tumor development; therefore	 these mutations should play a causal role in tumorigenesis. We chose to examine whether the MAM and Ig domain mutations are deficient in cell aggregation	 because previous studies indicated that these two domains of PTPÎ¼	 a close homolog of PTPÏ	 are required for its cell-cell aggregation function (13	15	 17). Recently	 the crystal structure of the N-terminal MAM and Ig domains of PTPÎ¼ was determined at 2.7 Ã… resolution (17	 18). Five tumor-derived mutations of PTPÏ are located in the two domains and all of them can be mapped to equivalent residues in the MAM and Ig domain structure of PTPÎ¼. Based on the crystal structure	 the authors predicted that 4 of them (F74S	 A209T	 F248S and Y280H) would cause significant perturbation of the structure of PTPRT	 because these mutations dramatically alter the character of buried side-chains (17). Moreover	 the fifth mutation K218T is located on the surface of the Ig domain and the authors predicted that this mutation would directly alter protein-protein interactions (17). Our data indicated that the K218T mutation affects the size of aggregates and only a small effect on the percentage of cells incorporated into the aggregates	 suggesting that the K218T mutant may decrease the binding affinity of PTPÏ. Interestingly	 the other four mutations significantly reduce the percentage of aggregation	 therefore	 these data suggest that the F74S	 A209T	 F248S and Y280H mutations dramatically alter the domain structure and lead to perturbation of the homophilic interaction of PTPÏ. Our previous studies showed that the tumor-derived phosphatase domain mutations of PTPÏ diminish its phosphatase activity and overexpression of PTPÏ suppresses the growth of colorectal cancer cells	 indicating that PTPÏ normally act as a tumor suppressor (2). The loss-of-function nature of these five extracellular mutations provides further supportive evidence to this notion.  The finding that PTPÏ mediates homophilic cell aggregation of non-adhesive insect Sf9 cells suggests that this protein could be involved in cell-cell adhesion in human epithelial cells where it is endogenously expressed. The type IIB RPTP subfamily consists of PTPÎ¼	 PTPÎº	 PTPÏ and PCP-2. It has been shown that PTPÎ¼	 PTPÎº and PTPÎ» (PCP-2)	 mediate homophilic cell-cell adhesion (9â€“12). Interestingly	 the homophilic interaction of these RPTPs seems to be highly specific	 because we and others showed that neither PTPÏ nor PTPÎº (15) interact with PTPÎ¼. It is worth noting that the juxtamembrane domain of PTPÏ may be necessary for its cell adhesion function. As shown in Figure 2	 Sf9 cells expressing the extracellular and juxtamembrane domains of PTPÏ	 but not cells expressing the extracellular and transmembrane portion of the protein (PTPÏ Extra-TM)	 formed cell aggregates	 although both proteins were expressed on the cell surface (Fig. 7). Expression of a construct encoding the extracellular	 transmembrane and only 55 amino acids of the juxtamembrane domain of PTPÎ¼ in non-adhesive Sf9 insect cells induced cell aggregation (9). It is possible that cis interactions between the membrane proximal juxtamembrane domains are required for initiating	 stabilizing or maintaining cell-cell adhesion. Interestingly	 there are two PTPRT mutations (K788E and R790I) located in the juxtamembrane domain that are found in lung cancers (1). Moreover	 Besco et al. showed that PTPÏ interacts with cell adhesion molecules including E-cadherin	 Î±	 Î²	 and Î³-catenin	 and Î±;-actinin (19). PTPÎ¼ also binds the cadherin-catenin complex (7	 20â€“22). Loss of cell-cell adhesion	 such as genetic and epigenetic inactivation of cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin	 is thought to be a prerequisite for carcinoma invasion and metastasis (23). Therefore	 mutational inactivation of the cell adhesion function PTPÏ may also play a critical role in tumor migration and metastasis.  																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	
1	51||Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase T (PTPRT/PTPÏ) is frequently mutated in human cancers including colon	 lung	 gastric and skin cancers. More than half of the identified tumor-derived mutations are located in the extracellular part of PTPÏ. However	 the functional significance of those extracellular domain mutations remains to be defined. Here we report that the extracellular domain of PTPÏ mediates homophilic cell-cell aggregation. This homophilic interaction is very specific	 as PTPÏ does not interact with its closest homolog PTPÎ¼ in a cell aggregation assay. We further demonstrated that all 5 tumor-derived mutations located in the N-terminal MAM and Ig domains impair	 to varying extents	 their ability to from cell aggregates	 indicating that those mutations are loss-of-function mutations. Our results suggest that PTPÏ may play an important role in cell-cell adhesion and mutational inactivation of this phosphatase could promote tumor migration and metastasis.  Go to: Introduction Tyrosine phosphorylation is coordinately controlled by protein tyrosine kinases and phosphatases and is a central feature of many signaling pathways involved in tumor development (1). While activating mutations in protein tyrosine kinases have been shown to play vital roles in tumorigenesis (1)	 the role of phosphatases is less well-defined. We recently identified PTPRT	 also known as PTPÏ	 as the most frequently mutated PTP gene in colorectal cancers (CRCs) (2). PTPRT was also mutationally altered in lung	 gastric cancers and melanomas (2). The spectrum of mutations	 which included nonsense mutations and frameshifts	 suggested that these mutations were inactivating (2). Biochemical analyses demonstrated that missense mutations in the catalytic domains of PTPÏ diminished its phosphatase activity and overexpression of PTPÏ inhibited CRC cell growth (2). Taken together	 these studies strongly supported the notion that PTPÏ normally acts as a tumor suppressor gene. This conclusion was also supported by a transposon-based somatic mutagenesis screen in mice	 wherein PTPÏ was isolated as a target gene from two different mouse transgenic sarcomas (3).  PTPRT (PTPÏ) is a member of the type IIB receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) subfamily (4). Other members of this subfamily include PTPRM (PTPÎ¼)	 PTPRK (PTPÎº) and PCP2 (also called PTPÎ»	 PTPÏˆ	 PTPRO-omicron	 PTPÏ€	 hPTP-J) (5). These 4 RPTPs share the same domain structure: an extracelluar domain	 a juxtamembrane region and two phosphatase domains (6). The extracellular domains of type IIB RPTPs have high sequence identities (7	 8)	 all consist of a MAM (memprin/A5/PTPÎ¼) domain	 an Ig domain	 and four fibronectin type III (FNIII) repeats (6). The MAM domain is suggested to play a role in protein dimerization (6). The Ig domain is a disulfide structure that is found in many cell surface proteins and has been shown to mediate homophilic and heterophilic interactions between cell adhesion molecules (6). The FNIII motif was originally identified in the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin and later found to be present in many immunoglobulin superfamily cell adhesion molecules (6). We have identified ~15 somatic mutations that are localized in the extracellular domain of PTPRT/PTPÏ. How these mutations affect the functions of PTPÏ remains to be determined.  Three close homologs of PTPÏ	 PTPÎ¼	 PTPÎº and PTPÎ» (PCP-2)	 are known to mediate homophilic cell-cell adhesion (9â€“ 12). Expression of the full-length PTPÎ¼ (9) (10) or a construct encoding the extracellular	 transmembrane and 55 amino acids of the juxtamembrane domain of PTPÎ¼ in non-adhesive Sf9 insect cells induces cell aggregation (9). Furthermore	 homophilic binding of PTPÎ¼ was demonstrated between PTPÎ¼-coated fluorescent beads and cells that endogenously express PTPÎ¼ (9). The minimal region required for homophilic binding was mapped to the Ig domain of PTPÎ¼ (13). In addition	 the Ig domain is required for proper cell surface localization (14). However	 assays that test cell-cell aggregation demonstrate that the MAM and Ig domains as well as the first two fibronectin type III repeats are required for efficient cell-cell aggregation (15â€“ 18). Similarly	 PTPÎº was also demonstrated to mediate homophilic cell-cell aggregation (11). Here we report that PTPRT (PTPÏ)	 like its homologs	 mediates homophilic cell-cell aggregation in Sf9 cells. Most importantly	 the tumor-derived mutations located in the MAM and Ig domains are defective in this cell-cell adhesion function.  Go to: Results The extracellular domain of PTPÏ mediates cell-cell aggregation in Sf9 cells  To test whether PTPÏ mediates homophilic cell-cell adhesion	 we made the following PTPÏ baculoviral constructs expressing: (1) full-length PTPÏ; (2) the intracellular fragment of PTPÏ (Intra); (3) the extracellular fragment of PTPÏ with its transmembrane domain (Extra-TM); (4) the extracellular fragment of PTPÏ with its transmembrane	 juxtamembrane and wedge domains (Extra-JMD-W); (5) a chimera containing the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the EGF receptor and the intracellular PTP domains of PTPÏ (Fig. 1A). All of those fragments were tagged with V5 epitope tags. Proteins of the expected size were expressed in Sf9 cells infected with those baculoviral constructs (Fig. 1B). All of these proteins	 but the intracellular PTPÏ	 were expressed on the surface on Sf9 cells (Fig. 1C). To test whether these PTPÏ recombinant proteins mediate cell-cell adhesion	 a cell aggregation assay was performed following the procedure of Brady-Kalnay et al (9). Sf9 cells infected with a baculovirus encoding PTPÎ¼	 which was previously demonstrated to mediate cell-cell aggregation	 were treated in parallel as a positive control (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig 2	 the non-adhesive Sf9 cells expressing either the full-length PTPÏ or PTPÏ-JMD-W formed cell aggregates. On the contrary	 Sf9 cells expressing either the intracellular fragments of PTPÏ or the EGFR/PTPÏ chimeras remained as a suspension of single cells (Fig 1C). These results indicate that the extracullar fragment of PTPÏ play an important role in mediating cell-cell aggregation and the phosphatase activity of PTPÏ is not required for this function. Surprisingly	 although the construct that encodes the PTPÏ extracellular fragment with the transmembrane domain sequences only (Extra-TM) was expressed on the cell surface (see Figure 7)	 this protein failed to mediate cell aggregation of Sf9 cells	 suggesting that additional juxtamembrane sequences are required for either forming or stablizing the cell aggregates.

4	52||Protein tyrosine phosphatase Ï (PTPÏ) belongs to the classical receptor type IIB family of protein tyrosine phosphatase	 the most frequently mutated tyrosine phosphatase in human cancer. There are evidences to suggest that PTPÏ may act as a tumor suppressor gene and dysregulation of Tyr phosphorylation can be observed in diverse diseases	 such as diabetes	 immune deficiencies and cancer. PTPÏ variants in the catalytic domain have been identified in cancer tissues. These natural variants are nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms	 variations of a single nucleotide occurring in the coding region and leading to amino acid substitutions. In this study we investigated the effect of amino acid substitution on the structural stability and on the activity of the membrane-proximal catalytic domain of PTPÏ. We expressed and purified as soluble recombinant proteins some of the mutants of the membrane-proximal catalytic domain of PTPÏ identified in colorectal cancer and in the single nucleotide polymorphisms database. The mutants show a decreased thermal and thermodynamic stability and decreased activation energy relative to phosphatase activity	 when compared to wild- type. All the variants show three-state equilibrium unfolding transitions similar to that of the wild- type	 with the accumulation of a folding intermediate populated at âˆ¼4.0 M urea.  Go to: Introduction The classical protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) superfamily includes 38 proteins which specifically dephosphorylate phosphotyrosine residues and	 in concert with protein tyrosine kinases	 control a large number of diverse biological processes	 such as cell proliferation	 adhesion	 apoptosis and migration [1]â€“[6]. Reversible tyrosine phosphorylation controls numerous signaling pathways which require a right balance between kinase and phosphatase activity. The involvement of PTP in controlling cellular signaling has been largely recognized [2]	 [5]	 [7]	 though the role of PTP in human diseases has not been explored so extensively as that of protein kinases. However in diverse diseases	 such as cancer	 diabetes and immune deficiencies	 dysregulation of Tyr phosphorylation has been observed [4]	 [7]	 [8].  On the basis of their counteracting activity on the oncogenic protein tyrosine kinase	 PTPs have been initially considered as potential tumor suppressors	 however it is clear that several phosphatases have oncogenic properties [2]â€“[6]	 [9]. Over the last decade a limited number of phophatases have been studied systematically to evaluate their role in tumorigenesis. In particular	 six mutated phosphatases have been directly linked to colorectal cancers [1]	 [10]; among the six mutated genes	 the PTPRT gene encoding PTPÏ (PDB accession code 2OOQ) was found to be most frequently mutated and it was also mutated in about 20% of lung and gastric cancer [10].  PTPÏ belongs to the classical receptor type IIB family of PTP. The 107 PTPs encoded by the human genome are classified into four classes	 on the basis of the amino acid sequence of their catalytic domain. Class I includes 61 dual-specificity phosphatases and 38 classical phosphotyrosine-specific phosphatase which are further divided into receptor and non-transmembrane groups [5]	 [7]. The full-length PTPÏ contains an extracellular domain	 formed by a meprin-A5 antigen-PTP (MAM) domain and Ig-like and fibronectin type III-like repeats	 a single transmembrane segment and one or two cytoplasmic catalytic domains. The catalytically active proximal D1 domain is adjacent to the membrane and is connected to the inactive membrane-distal D2 domain [3]	 [5]. The PTP membrane-proximal catalytic domain consists of about 280 residues that fold into a highly conserved Î±/Î² structure [4]	 [11]. Conserved functional elements of the catalytic PTP domain are the PTP signature motif	 the mobile â€œWPDâ€ loop	 a highly conserved aspartate residue required for catalysis and the phosphotyrosine recognition loop.  In cancer tissues several PTPÏ variants in the catalytic domain have been identified and there is evidence to suggest that PTPÏ may act as a tumor suppressor gene [10]. These natural variants are nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs)	 single nucleotide variations occurring in the coding region and leading to a polypeptide sequence with amino acid substitutions.  A large number of amino acid substitutions originate from nsSNPs and an increasingly large number of diseases and defects reported in Human Gene Mutation Database [12] and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) [13] are referred to nsSNPs [14]. Although most nsSNPs are considered not to affect protein function	 computational analysis predicts that around 30% of protein variants resulting from nsSNPs are less stable than the most common variant [15]. The effect of disease-causing nsSNPs on protein structure and function has been widely investigated by computational analysis	 and change in protein stability has been suggested as the most common mechanism involved in monogenic disease [16]â€“[18]. However	 nsSNPs may also affect and modulate the protein function by altering protein dynamics without affecting protein stability [19]. Notably	 since genetic variations related to nsSNPs may influence individual susceptibility to complex diseases such as cancer [20] or response to drugs	 a more extended study about the effect of nsSNPs on protein structure may help in understanding their role in inducing protein functional changes [21]. To date there are few experimental data available concerning the consequences of nsSNPs on protein function and stability.  In this study we investigate the effect of amino acid substitutions identified in colorectal cancer [10] and in the single nucleotide polymorphisms database [18]	 [22]	 [23] on the thermodynamic stability and on the activity of the membrane-proximal catalytic domain of PTPÏ [1]	 [24]. The analysis revealed that	 in comparison to the wild-type	 the thermal and thermodynamic stability of all the mutants are decreased as well as the activation energy relative to the phosphatase activity	 indicating an increase in protein flexibility of all the PTPÏ mutants. All the variants show three-state equilibrium unfolding transitions similar to that of the wild-type	 with the accumulation of a folding intermediate at âˆ¼4.0 M urea.  To our knowledge	 this study represents the first spectroscopic and thermodynamic characterization of human PTPÏ catalytic domain and some of its mutants found in cancer. In addition	 the effects of none of the mutations reported in this manuscript on protein thermodynamic stability has been previously investigated.  Go to: Results Four mutations of the PTPÏ membrane-proximal catalytic domain in public databases have been identified: D927G	 Q987K	 N1128I and A1118P. Introduction of these mutations resulted in soluble recombinant protein only for D927G	 Q987K and N1128I whereas the A1118P mutant could not be expressed in the soluble fraction even when different growth and induction conditions were used. Mapping of the mutations onto the structure of the PTPÏ catalytic domain revealed that A1118P is located in the middle of a central helix (Fig. 1). It is likely that the introduction of a proline residue at this position in substitution of alanine will break the helical secondary structure resulting in misfolding of the catalytic domain. N1128 is located at the C-terminal end of the same helix (Fig. 1B). This residue is located in a very polar environment with flanking acidic (E1124	 E1127	 E1129) and a histidine residue (H974) located in a neighbouring loop region. D927G and Q987K are located in solvent exposed loops with little interaction with other amino acid side chains (Fig. 1C). The solvent accessibility of the mutated residues Asp-927 and Gln-987 is more than 70% and Asn-1128 is 49% solvent exposed. The mutation D927G involves a residue (Asp-927) placed in a 4 residues turn between two coils. In the wild-type Asp-927 connects different protein secondary structure regions through hydrogen bonds with three residues. One hydrogen bond is between the N of the peptide bond and the OD2 of Asp-947 and the other two hydrogen bonds are between the carbonyl of the peptide bond and the amidic nitrogens of Lys-930 and Glu-931. The carboxylic moiety of Asp-927 is completely solvent exposed and does not apparently make any contact with other residues.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Location of PTPÏ mutations. Spectroscopic characterization of PTPÏ wild-type and its mutants  The near-UV CD spectrum of wild-type PTPÏ shows the contribution of all aromatic residues and is characterized by two negative components centred at 280 nm and at around 298 nm accompanied by fine structure features at 275â€“280 nm (Fig. 2A). Q987K variant displays a near-UV CD spectrum almost identical to that of the wild-type as well as D927G and N1128I	 which nevertheless show a slight decrease of the dichroic activity at 275â€“280 nm. In line with the near-UV CD results	 which suggest a similar tertiary arrangement for the wild-type and all the variants	 the fluorescence emission spectra of mutants are similar to that of wild-type protein	 being all centred at the same maximum emission wavelength around 338 nm but characterized by a decreased emission fluorescence intensity (Fig. 2B). Far-UV CD spectra of all the PTPÏ mutants superimpose well with that of the wild-type and are typical of an alpha and beta protein	 showing a local minimum at around 208 nm	 a 200 nm zero intercept and a 1.13 ratio of the 208/222 bands (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that the SNP mutations had no effect on the secondary structure of the protein and suggest that	 in the native state	 the effect of the mutations are directed and localized to the mutated residue with minor modification of tertiary arrangements.  Figure 2 Figure 2 Spectroscopic properties of PTPÏ wild-type and mutants. Thermal unfolding  The thermal stability of D927G	 Q987K and N1128I was investigated by continuously monitoring the ellipticity changes at 209 nm between 10 and 72Â°C in comparison with that of wild-type (Fig. 3). The parameter chosen to compare the transition curves of PTPÏ wild-type and mutants is the melting temperature (Tm) defined as the mid point of the denaturation process calculated by plotting the first derivative of the molar ellipticity values as a function of temperature (Fig. 3	 inset). The temperature-induced ellipticity changes at 209 nm	 where the main amplitude was observed	 occur in an apparent cooperative transition for PTPÏ wild-type	 Q987K	 N1128I and D927G	 and with apparent Tm values of 43.0	42	 41.0 and 40.0Â°C	 respectively. The temperature-induced ellipticity changes for wild type and mutants are all coincident with the heat-induced increase of the photomultiplier tube voltage (PMTV) above 370 V (Fig. 3B)	 suggesting that the temperature-induced unfolding is accompanied by protein aggregation [25]. Aggregation occurred also when thermal scans were performed at a lower heating rate with a low-temperature shifts of the apparent Tm; the differences between the apparent Tm of wild type and variants were the same as those measured at higher heating rate (data not shown). The observed transitions are irreversible as indicated by the spectra measured at the end of the cooling phase that differ from those of the native proteins measured at the beginning of the thermal transitions (data not shown). Furthermore	 inspection of the cuvette at the end of the cooling phase revealed the presence of a large amount of precipitate in all the samples.  Figure 3 Figure 3 Thermal transition of PTPÏ wild-type and mutants. Temperature dependence of phosphatase activity  The temperature dependence of phosphatase activity of PTPÏ wild-type and variants was examined over the temperature range of 10â€“42Â°C (Fig. 4A). The optimal temperatures were estimated to be at 37Â°C for wild type and Q987K	 at around 33Â°C for N1128I and at 30Â°C for D927G (Fig. 4A). Notably	 at 37Â°C	 the phosphatase activity of all PTPÏ variants is significantly reduced and corresponds to 72	 54 and 20% of that of the wild-type protein for Q987K	 N1128I and D927G	 respectively. The activation energy	 Eaâ€¡	 determined by the Arrhenius equation (1) in the temperature range between 10Â°C and the optimal temperature of each protein	 corresponds to 13.88Â±0.40 kcal/mol for the wild-type and to 12.77Â±0.51	 10.73Â±0.54 and 11.38Â±0.46 kcal/mol for N1128I	 D927G and Q987K (Fig. 4B)	 respectively. This result suggests an increased flexibility of all the variants compared to the wild-type	 particularly evident for N1128I and D927G whose phosphatase activity is significantly decreased at 42Â°C. The comparison of temperature dependence of phosphatase activity with the structural thermal unfolding monitored at 209 nm clearly indicates that the D927G and N1128I variants are significantly more flexible and less thermal resistant than the wild-type.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Effect of temperature on phosphatase activity of PTPÏ wild-type and mutants. Urea-induced equilibrium unfolding transitions  PTPÏ wild-type and variants reversibly unfold in urea at 10Â°C in 20 mM TrisHCl	 pH 7.5	 containing 200 ÂµM DTT and 0.2 M NaCl. The effect of increasing urea concentrations (0â€“8 M) on the structure of PTPÏ mutants was analyzed by far-UV CD and intrinsic fluorescence emission spectroscopy and compared to the wild-type.  Incubation of PTPÏ wild-type and variants at increasing urea concentrations at 10Â°C for 30 min	 a time sufficient to reach the equilibrium	 resulted in a progressive change of the intrinsic fluorescence emission intensity and a red-shift of the maximal emission wavelength. At the end of the transition	 above 7 M urea	 the intrinsic fluorescence emission intensity is increased about 1.5 fold and the maximal fluorescence emission wavelength shifts to around 358 nm either for the wild-type and all the variants (Fig. 5). Determination of the red-shift of the intrinsic fluorescence emission was obtained by calculating the intensity averaged emission wavelength An external file that holds a picture	 illustration	 etc. Object name is pone.0032555.e001.jpg at increasing urea concentration (Fig. 6A). This parameter is an integral measurement	 negligibly influenced by the noise	 and reflects changes in both the shape and the position of the emission spectrum.  Figure 5 Figure 5 Intrinsic fluorescence emission spectra of PTPÏ wild-type and mutants. Figure 6 Figure 6 Urea-induced equilibrium unfolding of PTPÏ wild-type and mutants. The same samples used to monitor the fluorescence emission changes during the unfolding transition were used to monitor far-UV CD ellipticity (Fig. 6A). The unfolding process is fully reversible upon dilution of the denaturant	 either for the wild-type as well as for all the mutants (Fig. 6A). The urea-induced changes in intensity averaged emission wavelength An external file that holds a picture	 illustration	 etc. Object name is pone.0032555.e003.jpg and in 222 nm ellipticity of all the mutants are similar to that of the wild-type and show a sigmoidal dependence on urea concentration	 following an apparent two-state transition. However	 the transitions monitored by ellipticity changes and An external file that holds a picture	 illustration	 etc. Object name is pone.0032555.e004.jpg changes do not coincide (Fig. 6A) suggesting the possible presence of an intermediate in the transition region at approximately 4 M urea for the wild-type and for all the variants. The plot of the relative fluorescence intensity changes versus urea concentration shows a complex dependence upon increasing denaturant concentration for the wild-type and all the mutants (Fig. 6B). The data in Fig. 6B clearly indicate a non two-state unfolding process and the population of a denaturation intermediate at about the same urea concentration of the apparent denaturation midpoints observed by ellipticity and An external file that holds a picture	 illustration	 etc. Object name is pone.0032555.e005.jpg averaged changes (Fig. 6 A and B). The folding intermediate detected by relative fluorescence intensity is populated at around 4.45 M urea for wild-type and Q987K and at around 3.95 M urea for D927G and N1128I. The intrinsic fluorescence emission spectra of the folding intermediate are similar for all the proteins: the fluorescence intensity is increased of about 1.5 fold and the maximum emission wavelength is shifted from 338 to 345 nm	 with respect to the native state (Fig. 5). The hyperfluorescent intermediate of wild-type and variants retains about 35% of the 222 nm ellipticity of the native state (Fig. 6A).  The transitions monitored by relative fluorescence intensity changes (Fig. 6B) were fitted to a three-state unfolding process which yielded the thermodynamic parameters for wild-type and the variants of PTPÏ (Table 1). For the first transition	 m values are all closely similar to that of the wild-type	 suggesting a similar unfolding mechanism for all the variants; Î”G values lower than that of the wild-type are observed for N1128I and D927G	 suggesting a destabilization of the native state for these two variants	 that also show a decreased thermal stability (see Fig. 3 and and4).4). For the second transition	 that represents the unfolding of the intermediate to the denatured state	 the m values of all the proteins are lower than those of the first transition	 indicating that a larger increase in solvent-exposed surface area occur in the unfolding from the native to the intermediate state (Table 1). Notably	 Î”G values relative to the second unfolding transition for N1128I and Q987K are larger than those relative to the first transition	 suggesting a higher stability of the intermediate states	 compared to that of the wild-type.  Table 1 Table 1 Thermodynamic parameters for urea-induced unfolding equilibrium of PTPÏwild-type and mutants. The near-UV CD changes of D927G	 the most temperature sensitive variant	 upon increasing urea concentrations were monitored in comparison with wild-type (Fig. 7) to better characterize the nature of the intermediate state. The resulting data were analyzed after removal of the high-frequency noise and the low-frequency random error by a singular value decomposition algorithm (SVD) which resolved two main spectra components either for wild-type or for the mutant D927G. The most significant singular values were 2.05Ã—103 for wild-type and 1.96Ã—103 for D927G	 the second singular values were 38.2% and 40.1% of the first singular value for wild-type and D927G	 respectively. The plots of the first (V1) and of the second column (V2) of the V matrix which reflect the global change in the 250â€“320 nm region as a function of urea concentration show non-two state transition profiles comparable to the transitions monitored by intrinsic fluorescence emission intensity and confirm the accumulation of an intermediate at around 4.2 M urea (Fig. 7 B	 and C). At this denaturant concentration	 the near-UV CD spectra of wild-type and D927G significantly differ from those of the native state and are completely opposite in sign (Fig. 7A). The 298 nm negative band is lost and a positive contribution at 289 nm is present in the spectra of the intermediate state of both proteins. Furthermore	 the 280â€“260 nm region	 dominated by contribution of Phe and Tyr residues	 in D927G is less defined than the wild-type (Fig. 7A). The data clearly indicate that both the spectral components of the wild-type and D927G contribute to the urea induced transitions with the accumulation of a denaturation intermediate at the same urea concentration range observed by monitoring intrinsic fluorescence intensity (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6B).  Figure 7 Figure 7 Effect of urea on near-UV CD spectra of PTPÏ wild-type and D927G. The urea-induced unfolding transitions monitored by far-UV CD ellipticity changes are non-coincident with those monitored by fluorescence (Fig. 6) and near-UV CD (Fig. 7). To identify the number of spectral components contributing to the urea-induced ellipticity changes	 far-UV CD spectra were analysed after removal of the high-frequency noise and the low-frequency random error by SVD. The global changes in the spectral region 213â€“250 nm	 analyzed by SVD	 indicate that only two spectral components contribute to the far-UV CD spectra of wild-type and all the variants. The most significant singular values are very similar for wild-type and all the variants and range between 1.76Ã—105 and 1.67Ã—105. The second singular values are 19.8% of the first singular value for the wild-type	 16.6% for the D927G variant	 11.2% for Q987K and 8.0% for N1128I. All the other singular values are below 7.0% of the largest singular value and progressively decrease approaching to zero. The plots of the first column of the V matrix (V1)	 which reflect the global change in the 213â€“250 nm region	 as a function of urea concentration (data not shown) show sigmoidal transition profiles comparable to the transitions monitored at 222 nm for the wild-type and the variants (data not shown). Non cooperative changes of V2 at increasing denaturant are observed. Furthermore	 the reconstituted spectra of the first spectral component superimposed well with those of the sum of the first and the second spectral component (data not shown)	 indicating that only the first spectral component contributed to the urea induced transitions monitored by ellipticity at 222 nm. These results indicate an apparent two-state process for far-UV CD unfolding transitions of wild-type and variants. Thus the data have been globally fitted to a two-state model according to equation 4 with the m parameter shared between all the data sets. The free energy of unfolding	 Î”GH2O	 of wild-type and mutants obtained from the global fitting are very similar and correspond to 3.56Â±0.09	 3.63Â±0.10	 3.65Â±0.10 and 3.82Â±0.07 kcal/mol for wild-type	 N1128I	 D927G and Q987 K	 respectively	 for a shared m value of 1.06Â±0.05 kcal/mol/M. Equilibrium unfolding of PTPÏ wild-type and variants occurs via a hyperfluorescent intermediate state that cannot be detected by far-UV CD. Hence	 the thermodynamic folding intermediate may represent a conformational change which occurs in the proximity of any of the tryptophans most likely due to an increase of native state flexibility [26].  Go to: Discussion PTPÏ	 which belongs to the classical receptor type IIB family of PTP	 is one of the most frequently mutated PTP in human cancers [1]	 [24]. In this study we investigated the effect of amino acid substitution on the thermal and thermodynamic stability and on the activity	 of the membrane-proximal catalytic D1 domain of PTPÏ. Catalytically active fragments of several PTPs of type IIB family are proteolytically cleaved and released within the cytoplasm of tumour cells [27]â€“[29]	 hence the biophysical characterization of this catalytic domain may be relevant. The D1 domain is a monomeric	 structurally independent and stable folding unit characterized by a high thermodynamic stability. In this study	 we selected PTPÏ mutations of D1 domain found in colorectal cancers [10] and reported in nsSNP database [14]	 D927G	 Q987K	 A1118P and N1128I. All the mutants are expressed as soluble recombinant proteins	 except A1118P which remains insoluble also upon different growth and induction conditions. The spectroscopic properties of the wild-type compared with those of all the variants indicate that the mutations D927G	 Q987K and N1128I had no effect on protein secondary structure with minor modifications of tertiary arrangements.  All the mutants show a decrease in the thermal stability and in the activation energy for phosphatase activity with respect to the wild-type indicating an increase in protein flexibility of all the mutants. Hence	 at 37Â°C the phosphatase activity of all the variants was significantly reduced	 similarly to what reported by Wang et al. for Q987K and N1128I [10]. The most destabilizing mutation	 D927G	 yielded a protein that at physiological temperature was almost completely inactive.  All the mutations studied here are located at very diverse positions in the structure	 distant from the catalytic site and	 except A1118P	 in solvent-exposed loop regions. Presumably	 the change in main chain flexibility caused by the most destabilizing D927G mutation may lead to local disorder and may affect the stabilizing hydrogen bonds of residues in close proximity (Asp-947	 Lys-930 and Glu-931). This hypothesis is in agreement with the changes in local environment of aromatic residues suggested by the comparison of the near-UV CD spectrum of D927G with that of the wild-type. The N1128I mutation is less destabilizing than D927G. In the wild-type structure N1128	 about 50% solvent accessible	 is located in a very polar environment at the C-terminus of helix 8 and is involved	 through its peptidic nitrogen	 in a hydrogen bond with the peptide carbonyl of Asp-1124. The susbtitution of a polar residue	 Asn-1128	 to a nonpolar residue	 Ile	 may also contribute to destabilize the N1128I mutant. Q987K is the least destabilizing mutation with regard to thermal stability and temperature dependence of phosphatase activity	 probably due to the fact that Gln-987 in the wild-type structure is not involved in any interaction with other protein residues.  All the variants	 as revealed by intrinsic fluorescence emission intensity	 show three-state equilibrium unfolding transitions similar to that of the wild-type	 with the accumulation of a hyperfluorescent intermediate at âˆ¼4.0 M urea that retains 35% of the native secondary structure ellipticity. The hyperfluorescent intermediate of wild-type and of D927G	 the most temperature sensitive variant	 contains tertiary contacts	 although the packing of aromatic side-chains appears different from that of the native state.  The reversibility of the urea-induced unfolding equilibrium at low temperature allows a quantitative determination of the effect of mutations on the thermodynamic parameters of PTPÏ catalytic domain. The destabilizing effect of mutations caused by nsSNPs on PTPÏ thermodynamic stability (Table 1) may be referred i) to a destabilization of the native state for N1128I and D927G	 as indicated by the values of Î”GH2OI-N lower than that of the wild-type	 and ii) to a stabilization of the intermediate for all the variants	 as suggested by the higher free energy of unfolding from the intermediate to the unfolded state (Î”GH2OU-I)	 with respect to that of the wild-type (Table 1). The destabilizing effect of D927G and N1128I substitutions is also evident from the decrease in melting temperature monitored by secondary structure changes and from the significant reduction of phosphatase activity at 37Â°C that suggests a higher flexibility of the two variants with respect to the wild-type.  The reversible equilibrium unfolding transitions monitored by far-UV CD are not coincident with those monitored by near-UV CD and intrinsic fluorescence emission intensity and do not reveal any denaturation intermediate. The thermodynamic parameters relative to the apparent two-state equilibrium unfolding measured by far-UV CD do not indicate any significant difference between the variants and the wild-type and are lower than those determined by intrinsic fluorescence emission intensity. In particular	 the shared m value of 1.06 kcal/mol/M calculated from global fitting of the far-UV CD equilibrium unfolding data is significantly lower than the predicted m value for a monomeric protein of 280 amino acid residues unfolded in urea which is 3.71Â±0.3 kcal/mol/M [30]	 a value closely similar to that measured by fluorescence intensity. As a matter of fact	 fluorescence intensity is extremely sensitive to the microenvironment of a fluorophore and is considered as the most straightforward signal that can be related to thermodynamics of unfolding transitions [31]. The discrepancy between the thermodynamic parameters obtained by far-UV CD and fluorescence intensity and the lack of a detectable intermediate by far-UV CD may indicate that the hyperfluorescent intermediate state represents conformational changes which occur in the proximity of any of the tryptophans	 with an alternative tertiary arrangement. In the native state	 the maximum emission wavelength (Î»maxâ€Š=â€Š338 nm) indicate that tryptophan residues are shielded from the solvent	 whereas a partial exposure of tryptophan residues to the solvent is observed for the intermediate (Î»maxâ€Š=â€Š345 nm). These results are in agreement with the structural data which indicate that in PTPÏ two out of the five tryptophans	 Trp-994 and Trp-998	 are located in the same helical region (helix 6) and Trp-926	 Trp-1023 and Trp-1072 are placed in coil regions. All the five tryptophans are almost completely buried. In the native state the solvent accessibility of the five chromophores is 15% for Trp-998	 14% for Trp-926 and 4% for Trp-1023	 whereas all the other tryptophan residues are completely buried. Hence	 at approximately 4.0 M urea	 it is impossible to assign to any of the five chromophores a particular role in the fluorescence properties of the intermediate state.  In conclusion our results revealed a destabilizing and inactivating role of the mutations of PTPÏ D1 domain found in colorectal cancers [10]. All the amino acid mutations studied here are on the surface of PTPÏ and could potentially participate in protein-protein interactions. The stabilization of a folding intermediate	 coincident with an alternative tertiary arrangement	 may play a role in recognition and interaction with other substrate proteins as well as in sensitivity of this phosphatase to degradation.  																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
1	53||The receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase T (PTPRT/PTPÏ) is the most frequently mutated tyrosine phosphatase in human cancer. PTPÏ mediates homophilic cell-cell aggregation. In its extracellular region	 PTPÏ has cell adhesion molecule-like motifs	 including a MAM domain	 an immunoglobulin domain and four fibronectin type III (FNIII) repeats. Tumor-derived mutations have been identified in all of these extracellular domains. Previously	 we determined that tumor-derived mutations in the MAM and immunoglobulin domains of PTPÏ reduce homophilic cell-cell aggregation. In this manuscript	 we describe experiments in which we evaluated the contribution of the FNIII repeats to PTPÏ-mediated cell-cell adhesion. Our results demonstrate that deletion of the FNIII repeats of PTPÏ result in defective cell-cell aggregation. Furthermore	 all of the tumor-derived mutations in the FNIII repeats of PTPÏ also disrupt cell-cell aggregation. These results further support the hypothesis that mutational inactivation of PTPÏ may lead to cancer progression by disrupting cell-cell adhesion.  Keywords: Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase	 PTPRT	 PTPÏ	 fibronectin type III repeat	 cell-cell aggregation	 cell-cell adhesion Go to: 1. Introduction Cancer progression and metastasis is in part influenced by changes in cell adhesion and tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) (Paschos et al. 2009; Wheelock et al. 2008)	 as well as tyrosine kinases and tyrosine phosphatases	 respectively (Freiss and Vignon 2004; Ostman et al. 2006). Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) comprise a family of proteins that have extracellular CAM domains coupled to cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatase domains	 and thus can impact cancer progression by regulating both cell adhesion and tyrosine phosphorylation (Brady-Kalnay 2001; Ostman et al. 2006).  The type IIB PTPÎ¼-like subfamily of RPTPs includes PTPÎ¼	 PTPÏ	 PTPÎº	 and PCP-2 (PTPÎ») (Aricescu et al. 2008; Brady-Kalnay 2001). The extracellular segment of the PTPÎ¼-like RPTPs contain motifs found in CAMs	 including a MAM domain	 an immunoglobulin (Ig) domain and four fibronectin type III (FNIII) repeats (Aricescu et al. 2008; Brady-Kalnay 2001; Ostman et al. 2006). PTPÎ¼ subfamily members bind homophilically (i.e. the â€œligandâ€ for PTPÎ¼ is an identical PTPÎ¼ molecule on an adjacent cell) (Brady-Kalnay et al. 1993; Cheng et al. 1997; Gebbink et al. 1993; Sap et al. 1994; Yu et al. 2008; Zondag et al. 1995). The Ig domain of PTPÎ¼ is responsible for promoting homophilic interactions (Brady-Kalnay and Tonks 1994)	 and proper cell surface localization (Del Vecchio and Tonks 2005). However	 both the MAM and Ig domains as well as the first two FNIII repeats are required for efficient cell-cell adhesion of PTPÎ¼ (Aricescu et al. 2006; Aricescu et al. 2007; Aricescu et al. 2008; Brady-Kalnay and Tonks 1994; Cismasiu et al. 2004; Zondag et al. 1995). PTPÏ and PTPÎº also mediate homophilic cell-cell adhesion (Sap et al. 1994; Yu et al. 2008). However	 PCP2 has not yet been demonstrated to mediate cell-cell adhesion or aggregation although in vitro binding studies indicate it can bind homophilically (Cheng et al. 1997).  All type IIB RPTPs are potential tumor suppressor genes (Burgoyne et al. 2009a; Flavell et al. 2008; McArdle et al. 2001; Yan et al. 2006). Notably	 PTPÏ is the most frequently mutated phosphatase gene in human cancers including colon	 lung	 skin and stomach cancers (Forbes et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2004). Defective adhesion mediated by PTPÏ may be at least one mechanism of cancer progression. In fact	 cancer derived mutations in the MAM and Ig domains of PTPÏ are defective in mediating cell-cell aggregation (Yu et al. 2008).  In addition to the tumor-derived mutations in the MAM and Ig domains of PTPÏ previously described (Wang et al. 2004; Yu et al. 2008)	 the majority of extracellular domain mutations are located in the FNIII repeats of PTPÏ (Wang et al. 2004). Given the importance of FNIII repeats in PTPÎ¼-mediated adhesion and aggregation (Aricescu et al. 2007)	 we tested the contribution of the FNIII repeats of PTPÏ to PTPÏ-mediated adhesion. We determined that deletion constructs where each of the extracellular domains of PTPÏ is removed	 including the FNIII repeats	 are defective in mediating cell-cell aggregation of Sf9 cells. Furthermore	 when we engineered the cancer-derived mutations in the FNIII repeats of these PTPÏ mutant proteins	 they also result in defective cell-cell aggregation. These results demonstrate the importance of the FNIII repeats in contributing to proper cell-cell adhesion and suggest that adhesion mediated by PTPÏ is likely important for the tumor suppressor activity of PTPÏ.

Materials and methods 2.1 Baculovirus generation  Baculoviruses were generated by transfecting cells with the BaculoGoldâ„¢ Linearized Baculovirus DNA (BD Biosciences	 San Diego	 CA) according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. The baculovirus for wild-type PTPÏ was previously described (Yu et al. 2008).  2.2 Sf9 cell culture  Insect Sf9 cells from (BD Biosciences) were maintained at 27Â°C in Graces Insect Medium (BD Biosciences). The medium was supplemented with 10% FBS from (Hyclone	 Logan	 UT) and Gentamicin (MP Biomedicals	 Solon	 OH). Viruses were added to Sf9 cell medium to induce the expression of proteins of interest. Cells were harvested 30 hours post-infection for further analysis.  2.3 Generation of PTPRT deletion constructs  The PTPÏ-Î”MAM	 PTPÏ-Î”Ig	 PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-1	 PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-2	 PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-3 and PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-4 constructs were generated by fusion PCR using the full-length PTPRT pVL1393-V5-His vector as the template. The primers 5â€™-GAAGATCTATGGCGAGCCTCGCCGCG-3â€™ and 5â€™-CCGGAATTCGGATCCTGGGGCGCTCTGAGCCCGGG-3â€™ were used to generate the PTPÏ-Î”MAM construct; the primers 5â€™-GCGTGGGAGGCTCTCTGCATGGATGAGCAAGGAC-3â€™ and 5â€™-CAATGGGTCTTGCTCATCCATGCAGAGAGCCTCCCACGCCCATTG-3â€™ were used to generate the PTPÏ-Î”Ig construct; the primers 5â€™-CTGCACACTTGGTCCTGGTTTTCACGATCAGCTCCGCGTA-3â€™ and 5â€™-TACGCGGAGCGTCGTGAAAACCAGGACCAAGTGTGCAG-3â€™ were used to generate the PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-1 construct; the primers 5â€™-CCGCCAGGGCCTCCCCTCACCGAGGAAGACGTTCCAGGAG-3â€™ and 5â€™-CTCCTGGAACGTCTTCCTCGGTGAGGGGAGGCCCTGGCGG-3â€™ were used to generate the PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-2 construct; the primers 5â€™-GAGGAGCTGGTGGTGCAGACTAAAATTTCAGCTCCATCCA-3â€™ and 5â€™-TGGATGGAGCTGAAATTTTAGTCTGCACCACCAGCTCCTC-3â€™ were used to generate the PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-3 construct and the 5â€™-GTCACCACTCGGATTGCCACCGGTGCCTCCACCCAGAATT-3â€™ and 5â€™-AATTCTGGGTGGAGGCACCGGTGGCAATCCGAGTGGTGAC-3â€™ were used to generate the PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-4 construct.  2.4 Immunoblotting  Sf9 cells were lysed in a standard lysis buffer (20 mM TrisÂ·HCl	 pH 7.5	 1% Triton X-100	 150 mM sodium chloride	 2 mM Benzamidine	 2.5Î¼g/ml Aprotinin	 2.5Î¼g/ml Leupeptin	 and 0.5Î¼g/ml Pepstatin). Samples were solubilized in 2X SDS loading buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Samples were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman	 Piscataway	 NJ) and immunoblotted with SK18 (Brady-Kalnay et al. 1993)	 which cross-reacts with PTPÏ.  2.5 Cell surface expression of PTPÏ  Cell surface expression of PTPÏ protein in baculovirus infected Sf9 cells was determined using a modified biotin-avidin reaction with the Cell Surface Protein Isolation Kit (catalog# 89991	 Pierce	 Rockford	 IL)	 as previously described (Yu et al. 2008). Briefly	 Sf9 cell media was removed and the flasks were incubated with rocking for 30 minutes at 4Â°C in 5ml of 0.25mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin in 1X PBS. The cells were mechanically removed from the flask	 centrifuged	 washed	 and lysed according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocols. To isolate cell surface expressed PTPÏ the cell lysate was added to a NeutrAvidin Gel column and incubated for 60 min at room temperature (RT) with rocking prior to washing and eluting proteins with 200Î¼l of sample buffer containing a final concentration of 55mM DTT for 60min at RT. The flow through was run on 6% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Total cell surface protein levels were normalized by immunoblotting cell lysates with an anti-actin antibody (JLA20). The normalized cell surface protein was run on 6% SDS-PAGE gels	 transferred to nitrocellulose and immunoblotted with antibodies to PTPÎ¼ that also recognized PTPÏ (SK18) followed by secondary antibody conjugated to HRP. The HRP signal was detected using a Fluor-S MAX MultiImager (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.	 Hercules	 CA).  2.6 Aggregation Assays  Sf9 cells were harvested by trituration. The cell suspensions were added to glass scintillation vials and incubated at 27Â°C at 90 rpm in a gyratory shaker for 30 minutes. For a given condition	 the cell suspension was transferred to a 100mm petri dish either prior to (0 time point) or 30 minutes after aggregation. Images were captured at 10X magnification with a Nikon TE-200 inverted fluorescent microscope (Tokyo	 Japan). To quantify cell aggregates	 pictures of four randomly selected fields were taken per dish. The area of each object (single cells and aggregates) was determined by the Metamorph software (Molecular Devices) using an auto-threshold setting for light objects and appropriate size filters that allowed the counting of cells and aggregates but not debris. The four replicates were combined to yield average readings per condition. The percent aggregation was then calculated as the average aggregate area at 30 minutes minus the average aggregate area at zero minutes divided by the average aggregate area at 30 minutes [(N30-N0)/N30]. A minimum of three independent experiments was performed per condition. Statistical significance was determined in Microsoft Excel using Studentâ€™s T-test. Error bars indicate standard error.  2.7 Site-directed mutagenesis  The I395V	 Y412F	 R453C	 Q479E	 S492F	 N510K	 T605M	 V648G	 A707T	 and L708P tumor-derived mutations (Wang et al. 2004) were generated by fusion PCR using the full-length PTPRT pVL1393-V5-His vector as the template. The primers 5â€™-TGGCCCACAGAACGTGGAAGTCGTAGACATCAGAGCC-3â€™ and 5â€™-CTTCCACGTTCTGTGGGCCA-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the I395V mutant; the primers 5â€™-CAGTGGGAGCCCTTCGGCTTCGCGGTGACCCGCTGCCAT-3â€™ and 5â€™-AAGCCGAAGGGCTCCCACTG-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the Y412F mutant; the primers 5â€™-CTACACCCTGCGAGGCCTGTGCCCCTTCATGACCATCCG-3â€™ and 5â€™-ACAGGCCTCGCAGGGTGTAG-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the R453C mutant; the primers 5â€™-GAGCGAGGAGCTGGTGGTGGAGACTGAGGAAGACGTTCC-3â€™ and 5â€™-CCACCACCAGCTCCTCGCTC-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the Q479E mutant; the primers 5â€™-TGTTCCTCTAGAATTCATCCAAGGGGGGCCCT TT-3â€™ and 5â€™-ATGAATTCTAGAGGAACA-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the S492F mutant; the primers 5â€™-TCCAGTGGAAACCTCCCAAGGAGACCAATGGGGTCATCA-3â€™ and 5â€™-CTTGGGAGGTTTCCACTGGA-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the N510K mutant; the primers 5â€™-CCATTGAATGAGACAGACATGACC ATCACAGTGATGCTG3-â€™ and 5â€™-ATGTCTGTCTCATTCAATGG-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the T605M mutant; the primers 5â€™-ATTATTGAGTGCTTTTC GGGGCCCGTGAGCTATCGGAAT-3â€™ and 5â€™-CCCGAAAAGCACTCAATAAT-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the V648G mutant; the primers 5â€™-CTACAGCATCTACTTCCAGACACTCAGCAAAGCCAATGG-3â€™ and 5â€™-TCTGGAAGTAGATGCTGTAG-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the A707T mutant; the primers 5â€™-AGCATCTACTTCCAGGCACCCAGCAAAGCCAATGGAGAG-3â€™ and 5â€™-GGTGCCTGGAAGTAGATGCT-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the L708P mutant.  2.8 Mapping of PTPÏ mutations onto the PTPÎ¼ crystal structure  The sequence of PTPÎ¼ and PTPÏ were aligned using CLUSTALW. Mutations probed in this study were mapped using this sequence alignment onto the PTPÎ¼ structure (PDB ID: 2V5Y). The figure was prepared utilizing PyMOL 1.2r1 (http://pymol.org).  Go to: 3. Results 3.1 Deletions in the MAM	 Ig	 and FNIII repeat domains of PTPÏ result in defective cell-cell aggregation  To test whether a protein mediates cell-cell aggregation or adhesion	 one has to express the protein of interest in the non-adhesive cells. Otherwise	 one cannot measure the aggregation or adhesion of a single molecule in the sea of other adhesion molecules naturally expressed in adhesive cells. This is the main reason that the non-adhesive Sf9 or Drosophila S2 cells are widely used models for such studies. To our knowledge	 nearly all cell lines of epithelial origin are adhesive cells and thus are not suitable for these studies. Introduction of putative adhesion molecules into non-adhesive Drosophila S2 insect cells has been used to demonstrate adhesive functions for fasciclin II	 connectin	 Dtrk	 ARK	 Neuroglian	 and Capricious molecules directly (Bellosta et al. 1995; Hortsch et al. 1995; Nose et al. 1992; Pulido et al. 1992; Shinza-Kameda et al. 2006; Snow et al. 1989). In a similar approach	 we and others demonstrated that the full-length form of PTPÎ¼ induced aggregation	 via a homophilic binding mechanism	 when expressed in nonadhesive Sf9 insect cells	 which are derived from the Fall army-worm Spodoptera frugiperda (Brady-Kalnay et al. 1993; Gebbink et al. 1993; Zondag et al. 1995). We have also used this system for analyzing PTPRT/PTP rho (Yu et al.	 2008). Examples of other cell adhesion molecules that have been studied in Sf9 cells include L1 (Gouveia et al. 2008)	 Galectin-3 (Inohara and Raz 1995) and C-CAM1 (Phan et al. 2001). Insect S2 and Sf9 cells are extremely useful systems to analyze adhesive mechanisms of cell adhesion molecules.  The MAM domain	 Ig domain	 and first two-FNIII repeats are essential for PTPÎ¼ cell-cell aggregation (Brady-Kalnay and Tonks 1994; Zondag et al. 1995). To test whether these domains are the minimal essential regions required for PTPÏ cell-cell aggregation	 baculoviral PTPÏ deletion constructs of the MAM domain	 Ig domain	 and each of the four individual FNIII repeats were made and expressed in non-adhesive Sf9 insect cells (Figure 1). All the PTPÏ deletion constructs were expressed and appropriately trafficked to the cell surface (Figure 1). To test whether these domains contribute to PTPÏ-dependent adhesion	 Sf9 cells were evaluated for their ability to mediate cell-cell aggregation when expressing the deletion constructs. Aggregation assays with Sf9 cells expressing the deletion constructs were conducted alongside aggregation assays using Sf9 cells expressing wild-type PTPÏ	 which mediates cell-cell aggregation (Figure 2) and serves as a positive control (Yu et al. 2008). Deletion of any of the extracellular domains of PTPÏ resulted in defective cell-cell aggregation compared to aggregation of wild-type PTPÏ expressing Sf9 cells (Figure 2). Deletion of the fourth FNIII repeat was the least severe where ~23% aggregation was observed. Deletion of the MAM domain	 Ig domain and FNIII repeats 1	 2 or 3 resulted in 5â€“16% aggregation. When the level of aggregation was quantified	 we determined that all of the deletion constructs resulted in a large and statistically significant reduction in cell-cell aggregation (Figure 2	 p-value<0.005). Together with our previous study	 these results demonstrate that all of the extracellular domains of PTPÏ are necessary for PTPÏ-mediated cell-cell aggregation.  Figure 1 Figure 1 PTPÏ deletion constructs are all expressed at the cell surface. Constructs containing deletions of one extracellular domain of PTPÏ each were generated and expressed in Sf9 cells. Total cellular protein and cell surface protein were isolated ... Figure 2 Figure 2 Deletion of any of the extracellular domains of PTPÏ disrupts cell-cell aggregation. Sf9 cells expressing deletion constructs of the individual extracellular domains of PTPÏ were allowed to aggregate for 30 minutes prior to imaging. Scale ... 3.2 Tumor-Derived PTPÏ Mutations in the FNIII repeats result in defective cell-cell aggregation  We next tested the effects of human tumor-derived mutations in the FNIII repeats of PTPÏ on PTPÏ-mediated cell-cell aggregation. We recently demonstrated that tumor-derived mutations in the MAM and Ig domains of PTPÏ are defective in cell-cell aggregation using the Sf9 aggregation assay (Yu et al. 2008)	 and given the above results	 we hypothesized that mutations in the FNIII domains would likewise result in defective aggregation. Ten human tumor-derived mutations are located in the second	 third and fourth FNIII repeats of PTPÏ (Wang et al. 2004). To test whether these mutations also affect cell-cell aggregation	 we engineered the ten human mutations by site-directed mutagenesis using the full-length PTPÏ baculoviral construct as a template (see Figure 3). The ten mutations are expressed in Sf9 cells at the expected molecular weight and at similar levels to full-length human PTPÏ (Figure 3). All of these mutants are expressed at the cell surface (Figure 3). When these mutant PTPÏ proteins were expressed in Sf9 cells and tested in aggregation assays	 we observed that all of the mutant PTPÏ proteins resulted in fewer and smaller aggregates than wild type PTPÏ (Figure 4). When the level of aggregation was quantified	 we determined that all of the FNIII mutations significantly reduced cell-cell aggregation (16â€“43%) compared to cells expressing wild type PTPÏ (68% aggregation	 p-value<0.008	 Figure 4).  Figure 3 Figure 3 PTPÏ proteins containing tumor-derived mutations in their FNIII domains are expressed at the cell surface. Ten mutations in the FNIII domains of PTPÏ were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in Sf9 cells. Total cellular ...

Discussion PTPRT/PTPÏ is the most highly mutated tyrosine phosphatase in human colon carcinomas. We and others found that PTPRT/ PTPÏ is also mutated in lung	 gastric and skin (melanoma) cancers (Forbes et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2004). The spectrum of mutations	 which included nonsense mutations and frameshifts	 suggested that these mutations were inactivating (Wang et al. 2004). Biochemical analyses demonstrated that missense mutations in the catalytic domains of PTPRT diminished its phosphatase activity and overexpression of PTPRT inhibited colon cancer cell growth. Moreover	 we showed previously that the tumor-derived mutations in the MAM and Ig domains of PTPÏ are defective in cell-cell adhesion (Yu et al. 2008). All these data suggest that PTPRT/PTPÏ normally functions as a tumor suppressor gene. The experiments presented in this manuscript evaluate the contribution of the individual extracellular domains of PTPÏ to PTPÏ-mediated adhesion. We demonstrate that in addition to the MAM and Ig domains	 the FNIII repeats are required for PTPÏ-mediated adhesion. Importantly	 we also show that PTPÏ-mediated adhesion is impaired by human tumor-derived mutations in those FNIII repeats. These studies indicate that all the tumor-derived mutations located in the extracellular domain of PTPRT are loss-of-function mutations	 thereby providing further evidence that PTPRT is a tumor suppressor. This notion is further supported by our recent study showing that PTPRT knockout mice are highly susceptible to colon specific carcinogen azoxymethane (AOM)-induced colon cancer (Zhao et al.).  PTPÎ¼-mediated cell-cell aggregation requires the MAM domain	 Ig domain	 and the first two FNIII repeats (Aricescu et al. 2006; Aricescu et al. 2007; Brady-Kalnay and Tonks 1994; Cismasiu et al. 2004; Zondag et al. 1995). The entire extracellular domain of PTPÎ¼ is predicted to make a rigid conformation with extensive interfaces between each of the domains (Aricescu et al. 2006). The minimal adhesive unit for functional cell-cell aggregation is the MAM domain	 Ig domain and the first two FNIII repeats (Aricescu et al. 2006; Brady-Kalnay and Tonks 1994; Zondag et al. 1995). However	 the FNIII repeats appear to play a role in spacing the key homophilic interaction domain(s) a certain distance from the plasma membrane. Deletion of the FNIII repeats changed the intercellular spacing of two apposing membranes (Aricescu et al. 2007). Cell-cell aggregation assays of the FNIII deletion constructs were not performed in that study (Aricescu et al. 2007). The amino acid residues of the interfaces between the extracellular domains are highly conserved between members of the type IIB RPTP subfamily (Aricescu et al. 2006; Aricescu et al. 2007) therefore it is likely that the PTPÏ adhesive interface resembles that of PTPÎ¼. Together our data support the hypothesis that the essential regions for PTPÏ-mediated adhesion resemble those of PTPÎ¼.  To gain insight into how the point mutations may alter the adhesive function of PTPÏ	 we modeled the human tumor derived PTPÏ mutations onto the crystal structure of PTPÎ¼ (Figure 5). The crystal structure of PTPÎ¼ includes only the first three FNIII repeats (Aricescu et al. 2007). Four of these mutations fall within the second FNIII (FNIII-2) repeat (I395V	 Y412F	 R453C	 Q479E). It is important to note that FNIII-2 is required for efficient cell-cell adhesion (Aricescu et al. 2006). Two of the mutations fall in the third FNIII (FNIII-3) repeat (S492F	 N510K). The mutation within the linker region between FNIII-1 and FNII-2 (Y412F) could alter the flexibility or positioning between the two domains. The other mutations (I395V R453C	 Q479E	 S492F	 N510K) appear to be clustered in surface exposed regions and/or near the linker regions between FNIII-2 and FNIII-3 that could alter flexibility	 position of individual FNIII repeats and/or protein-protein interactions. While these mutations do not correspond to the adhesive interface hypothesized for PTPÎ¼ based upon a single static crystal structure (Aricescu et al. 2007)	 some of the mutations fall within the FNIII-2 repeat which is required for adhesion	 and all of these surface modifications would likely alter either the three-dimensional topology and/or cis/trans interactions of PTPÏ.  Figure 5 Figure 5 Structural modeling of the point mutations of PTPÏ. The point mutations (indicated in red) evaluated in this manuscript were modeled onto the equivalent sites in the crystal structure of PTPÎ¼. The PTPÏ mutations likely alter cell-cell ... Other type IIB RPTPs also function as tumor suppressor genes	 by regulating adhesion and/or tyrosine phosphorylation of effector proteins. Expression of PTPÎ¼ is reduced in human glioblastomas (GBM) and cell lines (Burgoyne et al. 2009a). Reduction in full-length PTPÎ¼ expression with a concomitant increase in a proteolytically processed cytoplasmic fragment of PTPÎ¼ is observed in GBM cells and both are correlated with decreased adhesion and increased migration observed in the disease (Burgoyne et al. 2009a; Burgoyne et al. 2009b). Over-expression of the full-length form of PTPÎ¼ suppressed migration of GBM cells and reduces their survival (Burgoyne et al. 2009b). Of note	 at the same time that stable cell adhesion is reduced due to the loss of full-length PTPÎ¼ expression in GBM cells	 a catalytically active cytoplasmic fragment of PTPÎ¼ is released and translocates to the nucleus (Burgoyne et al. 2009b). Catalytic activity of this fragment is also necessary for cell migration and viability of GBM cells (Burgoyne et al. 2009b). Therefore	 both the tyrosine phosphatase activity of the cytoplasmic fragment of PTPÎ¼ and the loss of PTPÎ¼-mediated adhesion may contribute to the invasiveness of GBM cells.  PTPÎº is also implicated in tumor progression. PTPÎº expression is reduced in melanoma cell lines and human tissue biopsies (McArdle et al. 2001)	 and in Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma cells (Flavell et al. 2008). Over-expression of PTPÎº in Hodgkin lymphoma cells reduces cellular proliferation and survival (Flavell et al. 2008). Like PTPÎ¼	 PTPÎº is proteolytically processed (Anders et al. 2006)	 potentially as a result of aberrant glycosylation (Kim et al. 2006). It is not clear whether adhesion or catalytic activity of PTPÎº is required for its tumor suppressor activity (Flavell et al. 2008; Kim et al. 2006). Of note	 the cleaved cytoplasmic domain fragment of PTPÎº is catalytically active	 translocates to the nucleus and promotes Î²-catenin-mediated transcription (Anders et al. 2006). Signaling via the PTPÎº cytoplasmic fragment might augment the loss of stable cell-cell adhesion and may promote tumor progression.  Although speculative	 it is interesting to postulate that tyrosine phosphatase activity and or cleavage of PTPÏ will also be an important element of its tumor suppressor activity	 as has been demonstrated for PTPÎ¼ and PTPÎº. Interestingly	 we identified and validated STAT3 as a direct substrate of PTPRT (Zhang et al. 2007). STAT3 is latent transcription factor that translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus after being phosphorylated at the Y705 residue. It is possible that the cleaved intracellular fragment of PTPÏ	 which contains the phosphatase domains	 translocates to nucleus and dephosphorylates STAT3. Besco and colleagues found that PTPRT associates with the adhesion molecule E-cadherin and its binding partner p120 catenin	 which are PTPRT substrates (Besco et al. 2006). p120 also translocates to the nucleus and associates with the Kaiso transcription factor (Daniel and Reynolds 1999). Given the frequency and distribution of mutations in PTPRT/PTPÏ in human colon and other cancers	 a more thorough understanding of its biological function is warranted. 																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	54||Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase T (PTPRT/PTPÏ) is frequently mutated in human cancers including colon	 lung	 gastric and skin cancers. More than half of the identified tumor-derived mutations are located in the extracellular part of PTPÏ. However	 the functional significance of those extracellular domain mutations remains to be defined. Here we report that the extracellular domain of PTPÏ mediates homophilic cell-cell aggregation. This homophilic interaction is very specific	 as PTPÏ does not interact with its closest homolog PTPÎ¼ in a cell aggregation assay. We further demonstrated that all 5 tumor-derived mutations located in the N-terminal MAM and Ig domains impair	 to varying extents	 their ability to from cell aggregates	 indicating that those mutations are loss-of-function mutations. Our results suggest that PTPÏ may play an important role in cell-cell adhesion and mutational inactivation of this phosphatase could promote tumor migration and metastasis.  Go to: Introduction Tyrosine phosphorylation is coordinately controlled by protein tyrosine kinases and phosphatases and is a central feature of many signaling pathways involved in tumor development (1). While activating mutations in protein tyrosine kinases have been shown to play vital roles in tumorigenesis (1)	 the role of phosphatases is less well-defined. We recently identified PTPRT	 also known as PTPÏ	 as the most frequently mutated PTP gene in colorectal cancers (CRCs) (2). PTPRT was also mutationally altered in lung	 gastric cancers and melanomas (2). The spectrum of mutations	 which included nonsense mutations and frameshifts	 suggested that these mutations were inactivating (2). Biochemical analyses demonstrated that missense mutations in the catalytic domains of PTPÏ diminished its phosphatase activity and overexpression of PTPÏ inhibited CRC cell growth (2). Taken together	 these studies strongly supported the notion that PTPÏ normally acts as a tumor suppressor gene. This conclusion was also supported by a transposon-based somatic mutagenesis screen in mice	 wherein PTPÏ was isolated as a target gene from two different mouse transgenic sarcomas (3).  PTPRT (PTPÏ) is a member of the type IIB receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) subfamily (4). Other members of this subfamily include PTPRM (PTPÎ¼)	 PTPRK (PTPÎº) and PCP2 (also called PTPÎ»	 PTPÏˆ	 PTPRO-omicron	 PTPÏ€	 hPTP-J) (5). These 4 RPTPs share the same domain structure: an extracelluar domain	 a juxtamembrane region and two phosphatase domains (6). The extracellular domains of type IIB RPTPs have high sequence identities (7	 8)	 all consist of a MAM (memprin/A5/PTPÎ¼) domain	 an Ig domain	 and four fibronectin type III (FNIII) repeats (6). The MAM domain is suggested to play a role in protein dimerization (6). The Ig domain is a disulfide structure that is found in many cell surface proteins and has been shown to mediate homophilic and heterophilic interactions between cell adhesion molecules (6). The FNIII motif was originally identified in the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin and later found to be present in many immunoglobulin superfamily cell adhesion molecules (6). We have identified ~15 somatic mutations that are localized in the extracellular domain of PTPRT/PTPÏ. How these mutations affect the functions of PTPÏ remains to be determined.  Three close homologs of PTPÏ	 PTPÎ¼	 PTPÎº and PTPÎ» (PCP-2)	 are known to mediate homophilic cell-cell adhesion (9â€“ 12). Expression of the full-length PTPÎ¼ (9) (10) or a construct encoding the extracellular	 transmembrane and 55 amino acids of the juxtamembrane domain of PTPÎ¼ in non-adhesive Sf9 insect cells induces cell aggregation (9). Furthermore	 homophilic binding of PTPÎ¼ was demonstrated between PTPÎ¼-coated fluorescent beads and cells that endogenously express PTPÎ¼ (9). The minimal region required for homophilic binding was mapped to the Ig domain of PTPÎ¼ (13). In addition	 the Ig domain is required for proper cell surface localization (14). However	 assays that test cell-cell aggregation demonstrate that the MAM and Ig domains as well as the first two fibronectin type III repeats are required for efficient cell-cell aggregation (15â€“ 18). Similarly	 PTPÎº was also demonstrated to mediate homophilic cell-cell aggregation (11). Here we report that PTPRT (PTPÏ)	 like its homologs	 mediates homophilic cell-cell aggregation in Sf9 cells. Most importantly	 the tumor-derived mutations located in the MAM and Ig domains are defective in this cell-cell adhesion function.  Go to: Results The extracellular domain of PTPÏ mediates cell-cell aggregation in Sf9 cells  To test whether PTPÏ mediates homophilic cell-cell adhesion	 we made the following PTPÏ baculoviral constructs expressing: (1) full-length PTPÏ; (2) the intracellular fragment of PTPÏ (Intra); (3) the extracellular fragment of PTPÏ with its transmembrane domain (Extra-TM); (4) the extracellular fragment of PTPÏ with its transmembrane	 juxtamembrane and wedge domains (Extra-JMD-W); (5) a chimera containing the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the EGF receptor and the intracellular PTP domains of PTPÏ (Fig. 1A). All of those fragments were tagged with V5 epitope tags. Proteins of the expected size were expressed in Sf9 cells infected with those baculoviral constructs (Fig. 1B). All of these proteins	 but the intracellular PTPÏ	 were expressed on the surface on Sf9 cells (Fig. 1C). To test whether these PTPÏ recombinant proteins mediate cell-cell adhesion	 a cell aggregation assay was performed following the procedure of Brady-Kalnay et al (9). Sf9 cells infected with a baculovirus encoding PTPÎ¼	 which was previously demonstrated to mediate cell-cell aggregation	 were treated in parallel as a positive control (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig 2	 the non-adhesive Sf9 cells expressing either the full-length PTPÏ or PTPÏ-JMD-W formed cell aggregates. On the contrary	 Sf9 cells expressing either the intracellular fragments of PTPÏ or the EGFR/PTPÏ chimeras remained as a suspension of single cells (Fig 1C). These results indicate that the extracullar fragment of PTPÏ play an important role in mediating cell-cell aggregation and the phosphatase activity of PTPÏ is not required for this function. Surprisingly	 although the construct that encodes the PTPÏ extracellular fragment with the transmembrane domain sequences only (Extra-TM) was expressed on the cell surface (see Figure 7)	 this protein failed to mediate cell aggregation of Sf9 cells	 suggesting that additional juxtamembrane sequences are required for either forming or stablizing the cell aggregates.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Expression of PTPÏ constructs in Sf9 cells Figure 2 Figure 2 PTPÏ mediates cell-cell aggregation Figure 7 Figure 7 Cell Surface Protein expression of PTPÎ¼ and the PTPÏ mutant proteins PTPÏ mediates highly specific homophilic cell-cell aggregation  To test whether PTPÏ mediates homophilic cell-cell aggregation	 one set of Sf9 cells were infected with virus expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and another set of Sf9 cells were co-infected with viruses expressing either the full-length PTPÏ or red fluorescent protein (RFP). The GFP expressing cells were mixed with equal number cells expressing full-length PTPÏ (co-expressing RFP) and the aggregation assays were performed. As shown in Fig 3A	 the GFP labeled cells did not aggregate and did not contribute to the aggregates formed by cells expressing full-length PTPÏ (RFP). These results strongly suggest that the aggregation of Sf9 cells expressing PTPÏ is mediated through a homophilic interaction among PTPÏ molecules in trans	 but not through a heterophilic interaction between molecules expressed on the surface of Sf9 cells. Interestingly	 the homophilic interaction of PTPÏ is very specific. Although 63% of the amino acid sequences of the extracellular domain of PTPÏ are identical with that of PTPRM (PTPÎ¼)	 Sf9 cells expressing PTPÏ (co-expressing RFP) did not aggregate with PTPÎ¼ expressing cells (co-expressing GFP) as shown in Fig. 3B.  Figure 3 Figure 3 PTPÏ mediates homophilic cell-cell aggregation The tumor-derived PTPRT/PTPÏ mutations in the MAM and Ig domains are defective in cell-cell aggregation  Several studies demonstrated that the MAM and Ig domains as well as the first two FNIII repeats of PTPÎ¼ are the minimal essential regions required for its homophilic interaction (13	15	17	 18). We identified 5 tumor-specific mutations that are located in the two domains (2). Among these five mutations	 the F74S mutation is located in the MAM domain and the other four mutations (A209T	 K218T	 F248S and Y280H) are located in the Ig domain (Fig. 4A). To test whether these mutations affect their ability to mediate cell-cell aggregation in Sf9 cells	 we engineered the five mutations by site-directed mutagenesis using the full-length PTPÏ baculoviral construct as the template. The five mutant proteins are expressed at the expected size and at similar levels to wild-type PTPÏ on a western blot (Fig. 4B)	 indicating that these mutations do not affect their protein stability. None of these mutations significantly alter their cell surface expression	 as all five mutant PTPÏ proteins showed strong plasma membrane staining (Fig. 4C and Fig. 7). However	 as shown in Fig. 5	 all mutant PTPÏ proteins formed smaller aggregates than that of the wild-type PTPÏ protein. To quantify the cells aggregates	 percentage of cells that are incorporate into > 5-cell clusters were counted (as described in the material and methods section). As shown in Fig. 5	 Sf9 cells expressing all the mutants formed significantly less aggregates than that of cells expressing wild-type PTPÏ. The deletion construct of PTPÏ lacking the two phosphatase domains (PTPÏ Extra-JMD-W) and the K218T mutant exhibited similar levels of aggregation that were statistically less than wild-type PTPÏ (p < 0.01). Taken together	 our data demonstrated that the five tumor-derived mutations located the MAM and Ig domains of PTPÏ are deficient in cell-cell adhesion. Therefore	 these mutations exhibit varying degrees of loss-of-function in cell adhesion.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Expression of tumor-derived PTPÏ mutants in Sf9 cells Figure 5 Figure 5 Tumor-derived mutations of PTPÏ are defective in cell-cell aggregation Mechanistically	 the defect of the PTPÏ mutations in cell-cell adhesion could be resulted from either impaired ability in homophilic binding or reduced cell surface expression. Although immunofluorescent staining indicated that those mutations do not alter cell surface expression qualitatively	 it is imperative to quantify cell surface expression of mutant PTPÏ proteins. As described in detail in the method section	 baculovirus-infected Sf9 cell surface proteins were labeled with Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin and isolated on immobilized NeutrAvidin Gel. Western blots were performed with antibodies to PTPÎ¼ (SK18) or the V5 tag. The SK18 antibody recognizes the cytoplasmic domain of both PTPÎ¼ and PTPÏ. The results shown in Fig. 7 demonstrate that full length PTPÎ¼ and the wild-type	 mutant and deleted PTPÏ proteins were expressed at the cell surface. As a control for a non-cell surface protein	 the cytoplasmic intracellular domain of PTPÎ¼ (PTPÎ¼-intra) was expressed that is detected by SK18 (9). PTPÎ¼ intra does not contain an extracellular domain and therefore is not biotinylated nor precipitated by the NeutrAvidin gel (Fig. 7). Quantitatively	 the levels of cell surface expression of the 5 tumor-derived PTPÏ mutations were similar to that of wild-type protein. If the cell surface expression level (CSE value) of wild-type PTPÏ is arbitrarily assigned as 1	 the CSE values of F74S	 A209T	 K218T	 F248S and Y280H mutations were 2.3	1.1	1.6	 0.6 and 0.8 respectively. Interestingly	 some PTPÏ mutants that contain the extracellular domain but are unable to mediate cell-cell aggregation are expressed at higher levels on the Sf9 cell surface than wild-type PTPÏ. These results suggest that defect of PTPÏ mutation in cell-cell adhesion is mainly due to reduced homophilic binding affinity of the mutant proteins. Interestingly	 the cell surface expression levels PTPÏ Extra-TM (CSE value = 27) and PTPÏ Extra-JMD-W (CSE value = 20) were much higher than that of full-length protein for unknown reasons.  Go to: Discussion We demonstrated that PTPRT/PTPÏ meditates homophilic cell-cell aggregation and five tumor-derived mutations located in the MAM and Ig domains impair this function. Our results strongly suggest that those PTPÏ loss-of-function mutations are selected for during the process of tumor development; therefore	 these mutations should play a causal role in tumorigenesis. We chose to examine whether the MAM and Ig domain mutations are deficient in cell aggregation	 because previous studies indicated that these two domains of PTPÎ¼	 a close homolog of PTPÏ	 are required for its cell-cell aggregation function (13	15	 17). Recently	 the crystal structure of the N-terminal MAM and Ig domains of PTPÎ¼ was determined at 2.7 Ã… resolution (17	 18). Five tumor-derived mutations of PTPÏ are located in the two domains and all of them can be mapped to equivalent residues in the MAM and Ig domain structure of PTPÎ¼. Based on the crystal structure	 the authors predicted that 4 of them (F74S	 A209T	 F248S and Y280H) would cause significant perturbation of the structure of PTPRT	 because these mutations dramatically alter the character of buried side-chains (17). Moreover	 the fifth mutation K218T is located on the surface of the Ig domain and the authors predicted that this mutation would directly alter protein-protein interactions (17). Our data indicated that the K218T mutation affects the size of aggregates and only a small effect on the percentage of cells incorporated into the aggregates	 suggesting that the K218T mutant may decrease the binding affinity of PTPÏ. Interestingly	 the other four mutations significantly reduce the percentage of aggregation	 therefore	 these data suggest that the F74S	 A209T	 F248S and Y280H mutations dramatically alter the domain structure and lead to perturbation of the homophilic interaction of PTPÏ. Our previous studies showed that the tumor-derived phosphatase domain mutations of PTPÏ diminish its phosphatase activity and overexpression of PTPÏ suppresses the growth of colorectal cancer cells	 indicating that PTPÏ normally act as a tumor suppressor (2). The loss-of-function nature of these five extracellular mutations provides further supportive evidence to this notion.  The finding that PTPÏ mediates homophilic cell aggregation of non-adhesive insect Sf9 cells suggests that this protein could be involved in cell-cell adhesion in human epithelial cells where it is endogenously expressed. The type IIB RPTP subfamily consists of PTPÎ¼	 PTPÎº	 PTPÏ and PCP-2. It has been shown that PTPÎ¼	 PTPÎº and PTPÎ» (PCP-2)	 mediate homophilic cell-cell adhesion (9â€“12). Interestingly	 the homophilic interaction of these RPTPs seems to be highly specific	 because we and others showed that neither PTPÏ nor PTPÎº (15) interact with PTPÎ¼. It is worth noting that the juxtamembrane domain of PTPÏ may be necessary for its cell adhesion function. As shown in Figure 2	 Sf9 cells expressing the extracellular and juxtamembrane domains of PTPÏ	 but not cells expressing the extracellular and transmembrane portion of the protein (PTPÏ Extra-TM)	 formed cell aggregates	 although both proteins were expressed on the cell surface (Fig. 7). Expression of a construct encoding the extracellular	 transmembrane and only 55 amino acids of the juxtamembrane domain of PTPÎ¼ in non-adhesive Sf9 insect cells induced cell aggregation (9). It is possible that cis interactions between the membrane proximal juxtamembrane domains are required for initiating	 stabilizing or maintaining cell-cell adhesion. Interestingly	 there are two PTPRT mutations (K788E and R790I) located in the juxtamembrane domain that are found in lung cancers (1). Moreover	 Besco et al. showed that PTPÏ interacts with cell adhesion molecules including E-cadherin	 Î±	 Î²	 and Î³-catenin	 and Î±;-actinin (19). PTPÎ¼ also binds the cadherin-catenin complex (7	 20â€“22). Loss of cell-cell adhesion	 such as genetic and epigenetic inactivation of cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin	 is thought to be a prerequisite for carcinoma invasion and metastasis (23). Therefore	 mutational inactivation of the cell adhesion function PTPÏ may also play a critical role in tumor migration and metastasis.  																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	
1	55||The receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase T (PTPRT/PTPÏ) is the most frequently mutated tyrosine phosphatase in human cancer. PTPÏ mediates homophilic cell-cell aggregation. In its extracellular region	 PTPÏ has cell adhesion molecule-like motifs	 including a MAM domain	 an immunoglobulin domain and four fibronectin type III (FNIII) repeats. Tumor-derived mutations have been identified in all of these extracellular domains. Previously	 we determined that tumor-derived mutations in the MAM and immunoglobulin domains of PTPÏ reduce homophilic cell-cell aggregation. In this manuscript	 we describe experiments in which we evaluated the contribution of the FNIII repeats to PTPÏ-mediated cell-cell adhesion. Our results demonstrate that deletion of the FNIII repeats of PTPÏ result in defective cell-cell aggregation. Furthermore	 all of the tumor-derived mutations in the FNIII repeats of PTPÏ also disrupt cell-cell aggregation. These results further support the hypothesis that mutational inactivation of PTPÏ may lead to cancer progression by disrupting cell-cell adhesion.  Keywords: Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase	 PTPRT	 PTPÏ	 fibronectin type III repeat	 cell-cell aggregation	 cell-cell adhesion Go to: 1. Introduction Cancer progression and metastasis is in part influenced by changes in cell adhesion and tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) (Paschos et al. 2009; Wheelock et al. 2008)	 as well as tyrosine kinases and tyrosine phosphatases	 respectively (Freiss and Vignon 2004; Ostman et al. 2006). Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) comprise a family of proteins that have extracellular CAM domains coupled to cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatase domains	 and thus can impact cancer progression by regulating both cell adhesion and tyrosine phosphorylation (Brady-Kalnay 2001; Ostman et al. 2006).  The type IIB PTPÎ¼-like subfamily of RPTPs includes PTPÎ¼	 PTPÏ	 PTPÎº	 and PCP-2 (PTPÎ») (Aricescu et al. 2008; Brady-Kalnay 2001). The extracellular segment of the PTPÎ¼-like RPTPs contain motifs found in CAMs	 including a MAM domain	 an immunoglobulin (Ig) domain and four fibronectin type III (FNIII) repeats (Aricescu et al. 2008; Brady-Kalnay 2001; Ostman et al. 2006). PTPÎ¼ subfamily members bind homophilically (i.e. the â€œligandâ€ for PTPÎ¼ is an identical PTPÎ¼ molecule on an adjacent cell) (Brady-Kalnay et al. 1993; Cheng et al. 1997; Gebbink et al. 1993; Sap et al. 1994; Yu et al. 2008; Zondag et al. 1995). The Ig domain of PTPÎ¼ is responsible for promoting homophilic interactions (Brady-Kalnay and Tonks 1994)	 and proper cell surface localization (Del Vecchio and Tonks 2005). However	 both the MAM and Ig domains as well as the first two FNIII repeats are required for efficient cell-cell adhesion of PTPÎ¼ (Aricescu et al. 2006; Aricescu et al. 2007; Aricescu et al. 2008; Brady-Kalnay and Tonks 1994; Cismasiu et al. 2004; Zondag et al. 1995). PTPÏ and PTPÎº also mediate homophilic cell-cell adhesion (Sap et al. 1994; Yu et al. 2008). However	 PCP2 has not yet been demonstrated to mediate cell-cell adhesion or aggregation although in vitro binding studies indicate it can bind homophilically (Cheng et al. 1997).  All type IIB RPTPs are potential tumor suppressor genes (Burgoyne et al. 2009a; Flavell et al. 2008; McArdle et al. 2001; Yan et al. 2006). Notably	 PTPÏ is the most frequently mutated phosphatase gene in human cancers including colon	 lung	 skin and stomach cancers (Forbes et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2004). Defective adhesion mediated by PTPÏ may be at least one mechanism of cancer progression. In fact	 cancer derived mutations in the MAM and Ig domains of PTPÏ are defective in mediating cell-cell aggregation (Yu et al. 2008).  In addition to the tumor-derived mutations in the MAM and Ig domains of PTPÏ previously described (Wang et al. 2004; Yu et al. 2008)	 the majority of extracellular domain mutations are located in the FNIII repeats of PTPÏ (Wang et al. 2004). Given the importance of FNIII repeats in PTPÎ¼-mediated adhesion and aggregation (Aricescu et al. 2007)	 we tested the contribution of the FNIII repeats of PTPÏ to PTPÏ-mediated adhesion. We determined that deletion constructs where each of the extracellular domains of PTPÏ is removed	 including the FNIII repeats	 are defective in mediating cell-cell aggregation of Sf9 cells. Furthermore	 when we engineered the cancer-derived mutations in the FNIII repeats of these PTPÏ mutant proteins	 they also result in defective cell-cell aggregation. These results demonstrate the importance of the FNIII repeats in contributing to proper cell-cell adhesion and suggest that adhesion mediated by PTPÏ is likely important for the tumor suppressor activity of PTPÏ.

Materials and methods 2.1 Baculovirus generation  Baculoviruses were generated by transfecting cells with the BaculoGoldâ„¢ Linearized Baculovirus DNA (BD Biosciences	 San Diego	 CA) according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. The baculovirus for wild-type PTPÏ was previously described (Yu et al. 2008).  2.2 Sf9 cell culture  Insect Sf9 cells from (BD Biosciences) were maintained at 27Â°C in Graces Insect Medium (BD Biosciences). The medium was supplemented with 10% FBS from (Hyclone	 Logan	 UT) and Gentamicin (MP Biomedicals	 Solon	 OH). Viruses were added to Sf9 cell medium to induce the expression of proteins of interest. Cells were harvested 30 hours post-infection for further analysis.  2.3 Generation of PTPRT deletion constructs  The PTPÏ-Î”MAM	 PTPÏ-Î”Ig	 PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-1	 PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-2	 PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-3 and PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-4 constructs were generated by fusion PCR using the full-length PTPRT pVL1393-V5-His vector as the template. The primers 5â€™-GAAGATCTATGGCGAGCCTCGCCGCG-3â€™ and 5â€™-CCGGAATTCGGATCCTGGGGCGCTCTGAGCCCGGG-3â€™ were used to generate the PTPÏ-Î”MAM construct; the primers 5â€™-GCGTGGGAGGCTCTCTGCATGGATGAGCAAGGAC-3â€™ and 5â€™-CAATGGGTCTTGCTCATCCATGCAGAGAGCCTCCCACGCCCATTG-3â€™ were used to generate the PTPÏ-Î”Ig construct; the primers 5â€™-CTGCACACTTGGTCCTGGTTTTCACGATCAGCTCCGCGTA-3â€™ and 5â€™-TACGCGGAGCGTCGTGAAAACCAGGACCAAGTGTGCAG-3â€™ were used to generate the PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-1 construct; the primers 5â€™-CCGCCAGGGCCTCCCCTCACCGAGGAAGACGTTCCAGGAG-3â€™ and 5â€™-CTCCTGGAACGTCTTCCTCGGTGAGGGGAGGCCCTGGCGG-3â€™ were used to generate the PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-2 construct; the primers 5â€™-GAGGAGCTGGTGGTGCAGACTAAAATTTCAGCTCCATCCA-3â€™ and 5â€™-TGGATGGAGCTGAAATTTTAGTCTGCACCACCAGCTCCTC-3â€™ were used to generate the PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-3 construct and the 5â€™-GTCACCACTCGGATTGCCACCGGTGCCTCCACCCAGAATT-3â€™ and 5â€™-AATTCTGGGTGGAGGCACCGGTGGCAATCCGAGTGGTGAC-3â€™ were used to generate the PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-4 construct.  2.4 Immunoblotting  Sf9 cells were lysed in a standard lysis buffer (20 mM TrisÂ·HCl	 pH 7.5	 1% Triton X-100	 150 mM sodium chloride	 2 mM Benzamidine	 2.5Î¼g/ml Aprotinin	 2.5Î¼g/ml Leupeptin	 and 0.5Î¼g/ml Pepstatin). Samples were solubilized in 2X SDS loading buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Samples were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman	 Piscataway	 NJ) and immunoblotted with SK18 (Brady-Kalnay et al. 1993)	 which cross-reacts with PTPÏ.  2.5 Cell surface expression of PTPÏ  Cell surface expression of PTPÏ protein in baculovirus infected Sf9 cells was determined using a modified biotin-avidin reaction with the Cell Surface Protein Isolation Kit (catalog# 89991	 Pierce	 Rockford	 IL)	 as previously described (Yu et al. 2008). Briefly	 Sf9 cell media was removed and the flasks were incubated with rocking for 30 minutes at 4Â°C in 5ml of 0.25mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin in 1X PBS. The cells were mechanically removed from the flask	 centrifuged	 washed	 and lysed according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocols. To isolate cell surface expressed PTPÏ the cell lysate was added to a NeutrAvidin Gel column and incubated for 60 min at room temperature (RT) with rocking prior to washing and eluting proteins with 200Î¼l of sample buffer containing a final concentration of 55mM DTT for 60min at RT. The flow through was run on 6% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Total cell surface protein levels were normalized by immunoblotting cell lysates with an anti-actin antibody (JLA20). The normalized cell surface protein was run on 6% SDS-PAGE gels	 transferred to nitrocellulose and immunoblotted with antibodies to PTPÎ¼ that also recognized PTPÏ (SK18) followed by secondary antibody conjugated to HRP. The HRP signal was detected using a Fluor-S MAX MultiImager (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.	 Hercules	 CA).  2.6 Aggregation Assays  Sf9 cells were harvested by trituration. The cell suspensions were added to glass scintillation vials and incubated at 27Â°C at 90 rpm in a gyratory shaker for 30 minutes. For a given condition	 the cell suspension was transferred to a 100mm petri dish either prior to (0 time point) or 30 minutes after aggregation. Images were captured at 10X magnification with a Nikon TE-200 inverted fluorescent microscope (Tokyo	 Japan). To quantify cell aggregates	 pictures of four randomly selected fields were taken per dish. The area of each object (single cells and aggregates) was determined by the Metamorph software (Molecular Devices) using an auto-threshold setting for light objects and appropriate size filters that allowed the counting of cells and aggregates but not debris. The four replicates were combined to yield average readings per condition. The percent aggregation was then calculated as the average aggregate area at 30 minutes minus the average aggregate area at zero minutes divided by the average aggregate area at 30 minutes [(N30-N0)/N30]. A minimum of three independent experiments was performed per condition. Statistical significance was determined in Microsoft Excel using Studentâ€™s T-test. Error bars indicate standard error.  2.7 Site-directed mutagenesis  The I395V	 Y412F	 R453C	 Q479E	 S492F	 N510K	 T605M	 V648G	 A707T	 and L708P tumor-derived mutations (Wang et al. 2004) were generated by fusion PCR using the full-length PTPRT pVL1393-V5-His vector as the template. The primers 5â€™-TGGCCCACAGAACGTGGAAGTCGTAGACATCAGAGCC-3â€™ and 5â€™-CTTCCACGTTCTGTGGGCCA-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the I395V mutant; the primers 5â€™-CAGTGGGAGCCCTTCGGCTTCGCGGTGACCCGCTGCCAT-3â€™ and 5â€™-AAGCCGAAGGGCTCCCACTG-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the Y412F mutant; the primers 5â€™-CTACACCCTGCGAGGCCTGTGCCCCTTCATGACCATCCG-3â€™ and 5â€™-ACAGGCCTCGCAGGGTGTAG-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the R453C mutant; the primers 5â€™-GAGCGAGGAGCTGGTGGTGGAGACTGAGGAAGACGTTCC-3â€™ and 5â€™-CCACCACCAGCTCCTCGCTC-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the Q479E mutant; the primers 5â€™-TGTTCCTCTAGAATTCATCCAAGGGGGGCCCT TT-3â€™ and 5â€™-ATGAATTCTAGAGGAACA-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the S492F mutant; the primers 5â€™-TCCAGTGGAAACCTCCCAAGGAGACCAATGGGGTCATCA-3â€™ and 5â€™-CTTGGGAGGTTTCCACTGGA-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the N510K mutant; the primers 5â€™-CCATTGAATGAGACAGACATGACC ATCACAGTGATGCTG3-â€™ and 5â€™-ATGTCTGTCTCATTCAATGG-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the T605M mutant; the primers 5â€™-ATTATTGAGTGCTTTTC GGGGCCCGTGAGCTATCGGAAT-3â€™ and 5â€™-CCCGAAAAGCACTCAATAAT-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the V648G mutant; the primers 5â€™-CTACAGCATCTACTTCCAGACACTCAGCAAAGCCAATGG-3â€™ and 5â€™-TCTGGAAGTAGATGCTGTAG-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the A707T mutant; the primers 5â€™-AGCATCTACTTCCAGGCACCCAGCAAAGCCAATGGAGAG-3â€™ and 5â€™-GGTGCCTGGAAGTAGATGCT-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the L708P mutant.  2.8 Mapping of PTPÏ mutations onto the PTPÎ¼ crystal structure  The sequence of PTPÎ¼ and PTPÏ were aligned using CLUSTALW. Mutations probed in this study were mapped using this sequence alignment onto the PTPÎ¼ structure (PDB ID: 2V5Y). The figure was prepared utilizing PyMOL 1.2r1 (http://pymol.org).  Go to: 3. Results 3.1 Deletions in the MAM	 Ig	 and FNIII repeat domains of PTPÏ result in defective cell-cell aggregation  To test whether a protein mediates cell-cell aggregation or adhesion	 one has to express the protein of interest in the non-adhesive cells. Otherwise	 one cannot measure the aggregation or adhesion of a single molecule in the sea of other adhesion molecules naturally expressed in adhesive cells. This is the main reason that the non-adhesive Sf9 or Drosophila S2 cells are widely used models for such studies. To our knowledge	 nearly all cell lines of epithelial origin are adhesive cells and thus are not suitable for these studies. Introduction of putative adhesion molecules into non-adhesive Drosophila S2 insect cells has been used to demonstrate adhesive functions for fasciclin II	 connectin	 Dtrk	 ARK	 Neuroglian	 and Capricious molecules directly (Bellosta et al. 1995; Hortsch et al. 1995; Nose et al. 1992; Pulido et al. 1992; Shinza-Kameda et al. 2006; Snow et al. 1989). In a similar approach	 we and others demonstrated that the full-length form of PTPÎ¼ induced aggregation	 via a homophilic binding mechanism	 when expressed in nonadhesive Sf9 insect cells	 which are derived from the Fall army-worm Spodoptera frugiperda (Brady-Kalnay et al. 1993; Gebbink et al. 1993; Zondag et al. 1995). We have also used this system for analyzing PTPRT/PTP rho (Yu et al.	 2008). Examples of other cell adhesion molecules that have been studied in Sf9 cells include L1 (Gouveia et al. 2008)	 Galectin-3 (Inohara and Raz 1995) and C-CAM1 (Phan et al. 2001). Insect S2 and Sf9 cells are extremely useful systems to analyze adhesive mechanisms of cell adhesion molecules.  The MAM domain	 Ig domain	 and first two-FNIII repeats are essential for PTPÎ¼ cell-cell aggregation (Brady-Kalnay and Tonks 1994; Zondag et al. 1995). To test whether these domains are the minimal essential regions required for PTPÏ cell-cell aggregation	 baculoviral PTPÏ deletion constructs of the MAM domain	 Ig domain	 and each of the four individual FNIII repeats were made and expressed in non-adhesive Sf9 insect cells (Figure 1). All the PTPÏ deletion constructs were expressed and appropriately trafficked to the cell surface (Figure 1). To test whether these domains contribute to PTPÏ-dependent adhesion	 Sf9 cells were evaluated for their ability to mediate cell-cell aggregation when expressing the deletion constructs. Aggregation assays with Sf9 cells expressing the deletion constructs were conducted alongside aggregation assays using Sf9 cells expressing wild-type PTPÏ	 which mediates cell-cell aggregation (Figure 2) and serves as a positive control (Yu et al. 2008). Deletion of any of the extracellular domains of PTPÏ resulted in defective cell-cell aggregation compared to aggregation of wild-type PTPÏ expressing Sf9 cells (Figure 2). Deletion of the fourth FNIII repeat was the least severe where ~23% aggregation was observed. Deletion of the MAM domain	 Ig domain and FNIII repeats 1	 2 or 3 resulted in 5â€“16% aggregation. When the level of aggregation was quantified	 we determined that all of the deletion constructs resulted in a large and statistically significant reduction in cell-cell aggregation (Figure 2	 p-value<0.005). Together with our previous study	 these results demonstrate that all of the extracellular domains of PTPÏ are necessary for PTPÏ-mediated cell-cell aggregation.  Figure 1 Figure 1 PTPÏ deletion constructs are all expressed at the cell surface. Constructs containing deletions of one extracellular domain of PTPÏ each were generated and expressed in Sf9 cells. Total cellular protein and cell surface protein were isolated ... Figure 2 Figure 2 Deletion of any of the extracellular domains of PTPÏ disrupts cell-cell aggregation. Sf9 cells expressing deletion constructs of the individual extracellular domains of PTPÏ were allowed to aggregate for 30 minutes prior to imaging. Scale ... 3.2 Tumor-Derived PTPÏ Mutations in the FNIII repeats result in defective cell-cell aggregation  We next tested the effects of human tumor-derived mutations in the FNIII repeats of PTPÏ on PTPÏ-mediated cell-cell aggregation. We recently demonstrated that tumor-derived mutations in the MAM and Ig domains of PTPÏ are defective in cell-cell aggregation using the Sf9 aggregation assay (Yu et al. 2008)	 and given the above results	 we hypothesized that mutations in the FNIII domains would likewise result in defective aggregation. Ten human tumor-derived mutations are located in the second	 third and fourth FNIII repeats of PTPÏ (Wang et al. 2004). To test whether these mutations also affect cell-cell aggregation	 we engineered the ten human mutations by site-directed mutagenesis using the full-length PTPÏ baculoviral construct as a template (see Figure 3). The ten mutations are expressed in Sf9 cells at the expected molecular weight and at similar levels to full-length human PTPÏ (Figure 3). All of these mutants are expressed at the cell surface (Figure 3). When these mutant PTPÏ proteins were expressed in Sf9 cells and tested in aggregation assays	 we observed that all of the mutant PTPÏ proteins resulted in fewer and smaller aggregates than wild type PTPÏ (Figure 4). When the level of aggregation was quantified	 we determined that all of the FNIII mutations significantly reduced cell-cell aggregation (16â€“43%) compared to cells expressing wild type PTPÏ (68% aggregation	 p-value<0.008	 Figure 4).  Figure 3 Figure 3 PTPÏ proteins containing tumor-derived mutations in their FNIII domains are expressed at the cell surface. Ten mutations in the FNIII domains of PTPÏ were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in Sf9 cells. Total cellular ... Figure 4 Figure 4 Tumor derived mutations in FNIII domains of PTPÏ are defective in cell-cell aggregation.

Discussion PTPRT/PTPÏ is the most highly mutated tyrosine phosphatase in human colon carcinomas. We and others found that PTPRT/ PTPÏ is also mutated in lung	 gastric and skin (melanoma) cancers (Forbes et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2004). The spectrum of mutations	 which included nonsense mutations and frameshifts	 suggested that these mutations were inactivating (Wang et al. 2004). Biochemical analyses demonstrated that missense mutations in the catalytic domains of PTPRT diminished its phosphatase activity and overexpression of PTPRT inhibited colon cancer cell growth. Moreover	 we showed previously that the tumor-derived mutations in the MAM and Ig domains of PTPÏ are defective in cell-cell adhesion (Yu et al. 2008). All these data suggest that PTPRT/PTPÏ normally functions as a tumor suppressor gene. The experiments presented in this manuscript evaluate the contribution of the individual extracellular domains of PTPÏ to PTPÏ-mediated adhesion. We demonstrate that in addition to the MAM and Ig domains	 the FNIII repeats are required for PTPÏ-mediated adhesion. Importantly	 we also show that PTPÏ-mediated adhesion is impaired by human tumor-derived mutations in those FNIII repeats. These studies indicate that all the tumor-derived mutations located in the extracellular domain of PTPRT are loss-of-function mutations	 thereby providing further evidence that PTPRT is a tumor suppressor. This notion is further supported by our recent study showing that PTPRT knockout mice are highly susceptible to colon specific carcinogen azoxymethane (AOM)-induced colon cancer (Zhao et al.).  PTPÎ¼-mediated cell-cell aggregation requires the MAM domain	 Ig domain	 and the first two FNIII repeats (Aricescu et al. 2006; Aricescu et al. 2007; Brady-Kalnay and Tonks 1994; Cismasiu et al. 2004; Zondag et al. 1995). The entire extracellular domain of PTPÎ¼ is predicted to make a rigid conformation with extensive interfaces between each of the domains (Aricescu et al. 2006). The minimal adhesive unit for functional cell-cell aggregation is the MAM domain	 Ig domain and the first two FNIII repeats (Aricescu et al. 2006; Brady-Kalnay and Tonks 1994; Zondag et al. 1995). However	 the FNIII repeats appear to play a role in spacing the key homophilic interaction domain(s) a certain distance from the plasma membrane. Deletion of the FNIII repeats changed the intercellular spacing of two apposing membranes (Aricescu et al. 2007). Cell-cell aggregation assays of the FNIII deletion constructs were not performed in that study (Aricescu et al. 2007). The amino acid residues of the interfaces between the extracellular domains are highly conserved between members of the type IIB RPTP subfamily (Aricescu et al. 2006; Aricescu et al. 2007) therefore it is likely that the PTPÏ adhesive interface resembles that of PTPÎ¼. Together our data support the hypothesis that the essential regions for PTPÏ-mediated adhesion resemble those of PTPÎ¼.  To gain insight into how the point mutations may alter the adhesive function of PTPÏ	 we modeled the human tumor derived PTPÏ mutations onto the crystal structure of PTPÎ¼ (Figure 5). The crystal structure of PTPÎ¼ includes only the first three FNIII repeats (Aricescu et al. 2007). Four of these mutations fall within the second FNIII (FNIII-2) repeat (I395V	 Y412F	 R453C	 Q479E). It is important to note that FNIII-2 is required for efficient cell-cell adhesion (Aricescu et al. 2006). Two of the mutations fall in the third FNIII (FNIII-3) repeat (S492F	 N510K). The mutation within the linker region between FNIII-1 and FNII-2 (Y412F) could alter the flexibility or positioning between the two domains. The other mutations (I395V R453C	 Q479E	 S492F	 N510K) appear to be clustered in surface exposed regions and/or near the linker regions between FNIII-2 and FNIII-3 that could alter flexibility	 position of individual FNIII repeats and/or protein-protein interactions. While these mutations do not correspond to the adhesive interface hypothesized for PTPÎ¼ based upon a single static crystal structure (Aricescu et al. 2007)	 some of the mutations fall within the FNIII-2 repeat which is required for adhesion	 and all of these surface modifications would likely alter either the three-dimensional topology and/or cis/trans interactions of PTPÏ.  Figure 5 Figure 5 Structural modeling of the point mutations of PTPÏ. The point mutations (indicated in red) evaluated in this manuscript were modeled onto the equivalent sites in the crystal structure of PTPÎ¼. The PTPÏ mutations likely alter cell-cell ... Other type IIB RPTPs also function as tumor suppressor genes	 by regulating adhesion and/or tyrosine phosphorylation of effector proteins. Expression of PTPÎ¼ is reduced in human glioblastomas (GBM) and cell lines (Burgoyne et al. 2009a). Reduction in full-length PTPÎ¼ expression with a concomitant increase in a proteolytically processed cytoplasmic fragment of PTPÎ¼ is observed in GBM cells and both are correlated with decreased adhesion and increased migration observed in the disease (Burgoyne et al. 2009a; Burgoyne et al. 2009b). Over-expression of the full-length form of PTPÎ¼ suppressed migration of GBM cells and reduces their survival (Burgoyne et al. 2009b). Of note	 at the same time that stable cell adhesion is reduced due to the loss of full-length PTPÎ¼ expression in GBM cells	 a catalytically active cytoplasmic fragment of PTPÎ¼ is released and translocates to the nucleus (Burgoyne et al. 2009b). Catalytic activity of this fragment is also necessary for cell migration and viability of GBM cells (Burgoyne et al. 2009b). Therefore	 both the tyrosine phosphatase activity of the cytoplasmic fragment of PTPÎ¼ and the loss of PTPÎ¼-mediated adhesion may contribute to the invasiveness of GBM cells.  PTPÎº is also implicated in tumor progression. PTPÎº expression is reduced in melanoma cell lines and human tissue biopsies (McArdle et al. 2001)	 and in Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma cells (Flavell et al. 2008). Over-expression of PTPÎº in Hodgkin lymphoma cells reduces cellular proliferation and survival (Flavell et al. 2008). Like PTPÎ¼	 PTPÎº is proteolytically processed (Anders et al. 2006)	 potentially as a result of aberrant glycosylation (Kim et al. 2006). It is not clear whether adhesion or catalytic activity of PTPÎº is required for its tumor suppressor activity (Flavell et al. 2008; Kim et al. 2006). Of note	 the cleaved cytoplasmic domain fragment of PTPÎº is catalytically active	 translocates to the nucleus and promotes Î²-catenin-mediated transcription (Anders et al. 2006). Signaling via the PTPÎº cytoplasmic fragment might augment the loss of stable cell-cell adhesion and may promote tumor progression.  Although speculative	 it is interesting to postulate that tyrosine phosphatase activity and or cleavage of PTPÏ will also be an important element of its tumor suppressor activity	 as has been demonstrated for PTPÎ¼ and PTPÎº. Interestingly	 we identified and validated STAT3 as a direct substrate of PTPRT (Zhang et al. 2007). STAT3 is latent transcription factor that translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus after being phosphorylated at the Y705 residue. It is possible that the cleaved intracellular fragment of PTPÏ	 which contains the phosphatase domains	 translocates to nucleus and dephosphorylates STAT3. Besco and colleagues found that PTPRT associates with the adhesion molecule E-cadherin and its binding partner p120 catenin	 which are PTPRT substrates (Besco et al. 2006). p120 also translocates to the nucleus and associates with the Kaiso transcription factor (Daniel and Reynolds 1999). Given the frequency and distribution of mutations in PTPRT/PTPÏ in human colon and other cancers	 a more thorough understanding of its biological function is warranted. 																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
4	56||T-cell large granular lymphocytic (T-LGL) leukemia is a clonal disease characterized by the expansion of mature CD3+CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. It is often associated with autoimmune disorders and immune-mediated cytopenias. Our recent findings suggest that up to 40% of T-LGL patients harbor mutations in the STAT3 gene	 whereas STAT5 mutations are present in 2% of patients. In order to identify putative disease-causing genetic alterations in the remaining T-LGL patients	 we performed exome sequencing from three STAT mutation-negative patients and validated the findings in 113 large granular lymphocytic (LGL) leukemia patients. On average	 11 CD8+ LGL leukemia cell-specific high-confidence nonsynonymous somatic mutations were discovered in each patient. Interestingly	 all patients had at least one mutation that affects either directly the STAT3-pathway (such as PTPRT) or T-cell activation (BCL11B	 SLIT2 and NRP1). In all three patients	 the STAT3 pathway was activated when studied by RNA expression or pSTAT3 analysis. Screening of the remaining 113 LGL leukemia patients did not reveal additional patients with same mutations. These novel mutations are potentially biologically relevant and represent rare genetic triggers for T-LGL leukemia	 and are associated with similar disease phenotype as observed in patients with mutations in the STAT3 gene.  Keywords: LGL-leukemia	 cytotoxic T-cells	 STAT3	 PTPRT Go to: Introduction Large granular lymphocytic (LGL) leukemia was first described in 1985 as a clonal disorder involving tissue invasion of the bone marrow	 spleen and liver.1 Patients are prone to recurrent infections and often suffer from neutropenia	 anemia	 splenomegaly and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus.2 LGL leukemia can be divided into T-cell and natural killer (NK)-cell LGL leukemia depending upon the type of cell that is affected. T-cell LGL (T-LGL) leukemia is characterized as a chronic leukemia where there is an expansion of CD3+ CD8+ cytotoxic T cells.  The prevalence of LGL leukemia has not yet been accurately established and it could be underdiagnosed	 but it has been estimated to range from 2 to 5% of all chronic lymphoproliferative diseases in North America.3 In Western countries	 LGL leukemia arising from T-cells is much more frequent (85%) than NK-cell disease (15%). T-LGL leukemia is diagnosed at a median age of 55â€“60 years and has an equal gender distribution. Only 20â€“25% of patients are younger than 50 years.3  Our recent findings suggest that up to 40% of T-LGL patients harbor mutations in the STAT3 gene	4	 5 whereas a smaller subset of patients present with mutations in the STAT5B gene.6 Although these findings emphasize the role of STAT family genes in the pathogenesis of LGL leukemia	 the underlying genetic defects in the remaining T-LGL patients are yet to be discovered. In order to identify additional somatic mutations	 we chose three STAT3 and STAT5 mutation-negative T-LGL leukemia patients for exome sequencing.  Go to: Materials and methods Study patients  The study was undertaken in compliance with the principles of the Helsinki declaration and was approved by the ethics committees in the Helsinki University Central Hospital (Helsinki	 Finland)	 the Cleveland Clinic (Cleveland	 Ohio) and the Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute (Hershey	 Pennsylvania). All patients and healthy controls gave written informed consents.  The patient cohort consisted of 116 LGL-leukemia patients who were confirmed to be STAT3 and STAT5 mutation negative by exome sequencing or amplicon sequencing. The three patients selected for exome sequencing were untreated patients who were newly diagnosed at our unit	 and therefore fresh blood samples were available for sorting of CD8+ tumor and CD4+ control cells. The majority of the remaining cohort (n=113) consisted of archived DNA samples or frozen cells. In total	 the cohort consisted of 92 T-LGL leukemia and 24 NK-LGL leukemia cases. Forty-six samples were from the Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute	 sixty-one from the Cleveland Clinic and nine from Finland. All patients met the criteria of LGL leukemia as defined by the World Health Organization in 2008.  Sample preparation  Mononuclear cells were separated from all patient samples with Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare	 Buckinghamshire	 UK). Patient samples sent for exome sequencing were further labeled with CD4 and CD8 magnetic MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotech	 San Diego	 CA	 USA) and separated with an AutoMACS magnetic cell sorter (Miltenyi Biotech). A small amount of the CD8+ and CD4+ cells were used to analyze and confirm the purity of the sorted fractions with flow cytometry (FACSAria	 Becton Dickinson	 San Jose	 CA	 USA).  DNA and RNA extraction  DNA was extracted from fresh or frozen mononuclear cell	 CD8+ and CD4+ fractions with the Nucleospin Tissue Kit (Macherey-Nagel	 DÃ¼ren	 Germany). RNA extraction from CD8+ and CD4+ fractions was performed using miRNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen	 Venio	 The Netherlands). DNA and RNA concentrations were measured using Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Invitrogen	 Carlsbad	 CA	 USA) and NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific	 Wilmington	 DE	 USA)	 whereas the quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies	 Santa Clara	 CA	 USA).  VÎ² analysis  Peripheral blood samples from the three exome-sequenced T-LGL patients were used to determine the T-cell receptor (TCR) VÎ² repertoire of human T lymphocytes with the IO Test Beta Mark TCR VÎ² Repertoire Kit (Beckman-Coulter Immunotech	 Marseille	 France). The kit contains mixtures of conjugated TCR VÎ² antibodies corresponding to 24 different specificities	 covering about 70% of the normal human TCR VÎ² repertoire. To focus on specific blood cells	 the antibodies in the kit were used together with CD3+	 CD4+ and CD8+ antibodies. The samples were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSAria	 Becton Dickinson) in order to detect aberrant clonal expansion.  Exome sequencing  CD8+ T cells and matched CD4+ T cells from three STAT-negative T-LGL patients were used as tumor and control samples for exome sequencing. As described previously	4 the exome was captured with the Nimblegen SeqCap EZ Exome Library v2.0 (Nimblegen	 Basel	 Switzerland) and the sequencing was performed with the Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencing platform (Illumina	 San Diego	 CA	 USA). Candidate somatic mutations were identified with a bioinformatics pipeline consisting of Burrows-Wheeler Aligner for sequence alignment	7 Samtools for alignment filtering	8 Varscan2 for somatic mutation calling9 and Annovar for functional consequence prediction10 as described previously.4  Validation and screening of candidate somatic mutations by capillary sequencing  The candidate mutations were validated and screened by capillary sequencing in 113 STAT-mutation-negative patients. Primers were designed using Primer-Blast (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/	 National Center for Biotechnology Information). Capillary PCR products were either separated by gel electrophoresis and extracted from the gel using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) or purified using ExoSAP-IT (Affymetrix	 Santa Clara	 CA	 USA). The purified PCR products were sequenced with BigDye v.1.1 Cycle Sequencing kit and ABI PRISM 3730xl DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems	 Carlsbad	 CA	 USA). Sequences were analyzed using 4Peaks v1.7.2 (Amsterdam	 The Netherlands)	 Sequencher v5.0.1 (Ann Arbor	 MI	 USA) and BLAST.  The primer sequences are listed in the Supplementary Table 1.  Immunohistochemistry (IHC)  IHC staining with pSTAT3 and CD57 antibodies was performed with Leica BOND-MAX autostainer (Leica Microsystems	 Wetzlar	 Germany) to detect the infiltration of LGL cells (CD57 staining) and phosphorylation of STAT3 (pSTAT3 staining). Paraffin sections from five LGL leukemia patients and two healthy control bone marrow biopsies were processed with Bond Polymer Refine Detection kit (Leica Microsystems) using citrate buffer for antigen retrieval. Staining was done with a STAT3 Tyr 705 antibody (9145L	 Cell Signaling Technology	 Danvers	 MA	 USA) diluted 1:100 or a CD57 antibody (TB01	 Dako	 Glostrup	 Denmark) diluted 1:100.  The slides were analyzed with the Zeiss Axio Imager AX10 microscope (Zeiss	 Jena	 Germany) and photographed with Nuance FX multispectral tissue imaging system (420â€“720â€‰nm; PerkinElmer	 Waltham	 MA	 USA). The pictures were managed and prepared with Nuance 3.0.0 (PerkinElmer).  Microarray expression analysis  RNA was extracted from CD8+ cells of patient 1	 2 and 3 as well as from 2 STAT3-mutated LGL-patients. Anonymous Red Cross buffy coat CD4+	 CD8+ and NK RNA were used as biological replicates and controls in the experiment. Microarray analysis was performed using the Illumina Human HT-12 v4 BeadChip expression array (Illumina)	 which targets >47â€‰000 probes in the human genome (cover content from NCBU RefSeq Release 38 and legacy UniGene content). The data were read with an iScan instrument (Illumina) and primary analysis was done with Genome Studio software v2011.1 (Illumina). The results were normalized and log2-transformed with the Chipster open source platform.11 In order to determine the similarity of the expression profiles a distance dendrogram was constructed using Pearson correlation and the average linkage method. Differentially expressed genes were filtered from the data using the empirical Bayes test with P-value cutoff of 0.05.  Microarray data are available in the ArrayExpress database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress) under accession numbers E-MTAB-1611 and E-MTAB-2068.  Go to: Results Clinical characteristics  Three patients who were previously found not to carry STAT3 or STAT5 mutations were selected for exome sequencing. All patients suffered from T-LGL-leukemia with the phenotype CD3+ CD8+CD57+TCRÎ±Î²+CD5dim (Figure 1a). Furthermore	 all patients harbored a single monoclonal expansion	 which was detected by Vbeta-analysis (Figures 1b	 	2a2a and and3a).3a). Two of the patients displayed a major clonal expansion (73 and 89% of CD8+ lymphocytes)	 whereas one patient had a smaller expansion (28% Table 1). No clonal expansions were detected in the CD4+ lymphocytes.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Flow cytometry	 sequencing and VÎ² results from patient 1.

Table 1 Table 1 Clinical characteristics of the patients In all patients	 T-LGL leukemia was diagnosed at an advanced age (>60 years). Patients 1 and 2 suffered from concomitant neutropenia	 whereas patient 2 also had anemia and monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance that had not required treatment thus far. Patient 3 had no concomitant disorders (more detailed clinical characteristics can be found in Table 1).  Mutations revealed by exome sequencing  Exome sequencing of tumor (CD8+) and healthy (CD4+) cells yielded on average 53â€‰184â€‰000 paired reads that were mapped to the reference genome. The paired-end read length was 99 nucleotides for patient 1 and 101 for patients 2 and 3. The bioinformatics pipeline identified mutations expected to have deleterious impact on protein function based on PolyPhen predictions and conservation scores (Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling). On average	 patients had 11 high-confidence non-synonymous mutation calls with somatic P-values below 0.01 (see Supplementary Table 2). The variants chosen for validation by PCR are listed in Table 2. Variants were chosen based on P-value	 medical relevance and gene expression data from RNA sequencing when available.  Table 2 Table 2 Somatic mutations identified by exome sequencing and validated by capillary sequencing Mutations affecting the STAT3 pathway  Patient 1 was diagnosed with T-LGL leukemia at the age of 70 years and the TCR repertoire assay revealed one minor T-cell clone in the peripheral blood (VÎ²7.1: 28% Figure 1b). Exome sequencing of the CD8+ tumor and matched CD4+ control samples revealed 10 nonsynonymous nucleotide variants with P-values below 0.01. These mutations were validated by Sanger sequencing of the CD8+ tumor cells and not detected in the CD4+ healthy cell fraction. The tumor-suppressor gene protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) receptor T (PTPRT) was found to be heterozygously mutated with a variant frequency of 14%	 corresponding well to the 28% clone seen in the leukemic sample (Figures 1bâ€“d). PTPRT was previously found to reverse Tyr705 phosphorylation on STAT3	 a modification associated with STAT3 deactivation.12 In this novel mutation	 a highly conserved hydrophobic valine residue is converted into methionine (V995M). The mutation occurs in the cytoplasmic part of the protein	 within the catalytically active tyrosine-protein phosphatase 1 domain (Figure 1e). The PTPRT V995M mutation could therefore affect STAT3 activity by reducing dephosphorylation of Tyr705	 thus increasing the expression of STAT3 target genes.  Mutations affecting T-cell survival and activation  Patient 2 was diagnosed with LGL leukemia at the age of 76 years and harbored a major T-cell clone that constituted 73% of all CD8+ cells (Figure 2a). Exome sequencing of patient 2 revealed a H126R mutation in the BCL11B gene (variant frequency 51%) in the CD8+ leukemic cell fraction	 but no mutation was detected in CD4+ T cells (Figures 2b and c). RNA sequencing confirmed the expression of the mutation in the CD8+ cell fraction (Table 2). BCL11B is required for T-cell survival and overexpression could effectively increase T-cell activation and proliferation.13 The BCL11B gene is located on chromosome 14 and is primarily expressed in T cells	 thymocytes and the brain. In hematopoietic lineages	 BCL11B expression is restricted to T cells with transient low levels of expression in some immature NK cells. BCL11B has a key role in both T-cell development and maintenance of T-cell identity.14  This patient also had a missense mutation in RAD21 (E266K)	 which has a role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks as well as in chromatid cohesion in mitosis. The deletion of RAD21 in mouse thymocytes leads to defective chromatin architecture at the TCRÎ± locus and limited differentiation of cohesion-deficient thymocytes.15  Patient 3 was diagnosed with LGL-leukemia at the age of 60 years and presented with a major CD8+ clone of 89% at the time of sample collection (Figure 3a). Exome sequencing of the CD8+ LGL cells revealed a W674stop mutation in SLIT2 with a variant frequency of 54% (Figures 3b and d). No mutation was detected in the CD4+ control fraction. The mutation is located within a cysteine-rich domain (RRCT3) bordering to a LRR-domain	 which is hypothesized to mediate proteinâ€“protein interactions. SLIT2 is a secreted glycoprotein that possesses anti-inflammatory properties. In addition	 SLIT2 has been shown to modulate CXCR4-mediated functional effects in T cells.16  Another mutation	 NRP1 V391M	 was detected with a frequency of 37% in the patients' tumor sample (Figures 3c and e). The site is highly conserved and located within the Discoidin domain (F5/8 type C domain)	 which is a major domain of many blood coagulation factors. NRP1 was originally known as a receptor for the semaphorin 3 subfamily mediating neuronal guidance and axonal growth. NRP1 also binds the vascular endothelial growth factor and mediates interactions between dendritic cells (DCs) and T-cells that are essential for the initiation of the primary immune response.17  Screening of the mutations in LGL leukemia patient cohort  In order to validate the findings in a large cohort of LGL leukemia patients	 we collected samples from 113 LGL leukemia patients who were STAT3 and STAT5 mutation negative. PCR primers were designed to cover the mutation sites of PTPRT	 BCL11b	 SLIT2 and NRP1 (Supplementary Table 1) and samples were screened with Sanger sequencing. No additional patients were found to have mutations at the tested sites.  Gene expression analysis of STAT3 mutation-negative LGL leukemia patients  Microarray gene expression analysis was performed with CD8+ RNA from three STAT mutation-negative patients and two patients with known STAT3 mutations. CD4+	 CD8+ and NK-cell fractions from healthy controls were used as biological replicates on the microarray. In the distance dendrogram based on the gene expression profile (Figure 4a)	 healthy CD4+	 CD8+ and NK fractions clustered together	 whereas LGL leukemia patients formed a separate cluster. In the LGL-leukemia cluster	 patients were situated independently of STAT mutation status	 suggesting that the expression profiles are quite similar. This was further emphasized when analyzing the differential gene expression between LGL leukemia patients with or without STAT3 mutation: no genes were significantly over- or underexpressed. Comparison between all five LGL patients and the CD8+ healthy controls revealed 39 genes to be differentially expressed (Figure 4b). FGR	 a member of the Src family of kinases	 was overexpressed in the LGL leukemia patients when compared with healthy controls. It has been shown that FGR	 like other Src family of kinases	 can phosphorylate STAT3 thereby activating the STAT3 pathway.18 FGR is also activated by BCR-ABL in B-lymphoid cells in acute B lymphoblastic leukemia patients.19  Figure 4 Figure 4 RNA expression data. (a) Distance dendrogram visualizing the clustering of LGL leukemia patients and healthy controls (NK	 CD4+ and CD8+ cells) based on their gene expression profiles. (b) Heatmap representing the gene expression profiles ... The transmembrane receptor SLAMF6	 which mediates important regulatory signals between immune cells through hemophilic or heterophilic interaction	 was also overexpressed in LGL leukemia patients. SLAMF6 appears to co-stimulate especially CD8+ and CD4/CD8 double-negative T cells	 whereas SLAM signaling has also been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases	 including systemic lupus erythematosus.20 Interestingly	 tumor necrosis factor was expressed at a lower level in LGL leukemia patients when compared with healthy CD8+ cells.  STAT3 activation in STAT3 mutation-negative patients  Bone marrow biopsy samples from two healthy controls and five LGL patients with different mutational status were studied with IHC staining of CD57 and pSTAT3 expression (Figure 5). LGL cells typically express CD57 on their surface and IHC staining showed that bone marrow samples from LGL leukemia patients were infiltrated with CD57-expressing LGL cells	 whereas no such infiltration was observed in bone marrow samples from healthy controls. Three of the LGL leukemia patients included in the IHC staining were STAT mutation positive; two patients harbored STAT3 mutations (Y640F and D661V	 Figure5c) and one patient a STAT5 Y665F mutation (Figure 5d). These patients presented with positive pSTAT3 staining in the infiltrated lymphocytes indicating STAT3 activation. Phosphorylated STAT3 was also observed in bone marrow biopsy samples of LGL patients with PTPRT and BCL11B mutations	 whereas no pSTAT3 was observed in normal bone marrow. No bone marrow biopsy sample was available from patient with SLIT2 and NRP1 mutations.  Figure 5 Figure 5 Immunohistochemical staining of bone marrow-biopsy samples.

Go to: Discussion Our previous findings showed that somatic mutations either in the STAT3 or STAT5 gene occur in approximately 40â€“50% of LGL leukemia cases.4	 6 However	 as the STAT3 and STAT5 mutation-negative patients also have monoclonal expansion of LGL cells	 other somatic mutations may drive these expansions. In this paper	 we showed that mutations in the PTPRT	 BCL11B	 SLIT2 and NRP1 genes represent rare genetic triggers for T-LGL leukemia. These mutations are biologically relevant as they are connected either to the STAT3 pathway or T-cell activation and proliferation.  Previous studies have shown that almost all LGL leukemia patients exhibit activation of STAT3	 indicating that this pathway is essential for the pathogenesis of LGL leukemia.21	 22 We recently confirmed that also LGL leukemia patients without STAT3 mutations have activation of STAT3 responsive genes.4 Similarly	 in this study	 we showed that STAT3 was also phosphorylated in LGL patients without actual STAT3 mutations	 and that LGL leukemia patients clustered closely together in the RNA expression analysis independently of their mutational status. Therefore	 the novel V995M mutation in the PTPRT gene is particularly interesting as it may directly impact the STAT3 pathway. The mutation was found within the phosphatase domain D1 that is actively responsible for the phosphatase activity of type IIb members. The PTPRT gene encoding PTPÏ is also frequently mutated in other cancers such as in lung and gastric cancer.23  Pasquo et al.24previously studied the effect of missense mutations (D927G	 Q987K	 A1118P and N1128I) in the D1 domain on PTPRT stability and activation. All the mutants showed a decrease in thermal stability and activation energy for phosphatase activity with respect to the wild-type protein. At 37â€‰Â°C	 the phosphatase activity of all the variants was significantly reduced and the most destabilizing mutation	 D927G	 yielded a protein that at physiological temperature was almost completely inactive. We therefore hypothesize that inactivating mutations of the PTPRT gene may have the same functional consequence as activating mutations of STAT3 in LGL leukemia patients. Furthermore	 PTPRT was previously found to reverse Tyr705 phosphorylation on STAT3	 a modification associated with STAT3 deactivation.12 The PTPRT V995M mutation may thereby affect STAT3 activity by reducing dephosphorylation of Tyr705	 thus increasing the expression of STAT3 target genes. This is in accordance with our results showing that patient 1 with the PTPRT mutation had increased phosphorylation of STAT3 and activation of STAT3 responsive genes.  In order to clonally expand	 T cells must have acquired a survival advantage. It has been shown that some LGL leukemia patients have resistance to FAS-mediated apoptosis	 which could be mediated through STAT3 activation.25 However	 in addition to defects in apoptotic pathways	 survival pathways such as PI3K-AKT may be activated in LGL leukemia patients.21 Therefore	 it was of interest to observe that one T-LGL leukemia patient harbored a novel missense mutation H126R in the BCL11B gene. BCL11B functions as a transcription factor that is required for normal T-cell development. Inactivation of BCL11B in murine thymocytes leads to developmental arrest at the DN2-DN3 stage and aberrant self-renewal activity.26	 27 The role of BCL11B in the pathogenesis of hematological diseases still remains controversial. Increased levels of BCL11B expression have been found to be associated with human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)	28 and the inhibition of BCL11B expression in malignant T cells results in apoptosis.29 Downregulation of BCL11B gene expression by small interfering RNA led to growth inhibition and apoptosis in a human T-ALL cell line	 although not in normal mature T and CD34+ cells.30 Furthermore	 BCL11B knockdown in Jurkat cells induces apoptosis	 whereas BCL11B overexpression in Jurkat cells induces cell cycle arrest under genotoxic stress	 which is consistent with the oncogenic properties of BCL11B.29	 31 Mutations in BCL11B have been reported in two separate studies of T-ALL patients; missense mutations and deletions were found in 9% of 117 unselected T-ALL patients22 and in 16% of 71 TLX1-overexpressing T-ALL cases.32	 33 In addition to BCL11B mutation	 same patient also had a mutation in the RAD21 gene in the CD8+ fraction. RAD21 has previously been found to be mutated in AML with a prevalence of 4.1% (7/170). In AML	 the mutations were distributed over the whole gene and consisted of missense	 nonsense and synonymous variants.34  SLIT2 belongs to a group of large secreted glycoproteins originally described in regulating neural migration.35 However	 its predominant receptor Robo1 belongs to a novel subfamily of immunoglobulin superfamily proteins36 and is also expressed in several nonneuronal tissues	 including leukocytes. It has also been shown that SLIT2 can inhibit T-cell chemotaxis induced by chemotactic factors through chemokine receptors CXCL12/CXCR4.16 According to COSMIC	 mutations in SLIT2 have never been found in hematopoietic or lymphoid tissues before	 making the stop-gained mutation W674stop unique in this aspect. Previously	 SLIT2 has been found frequently methylated in lung	 breast	 colorectal and glial tumors and it has been shown that SLIT2 can act as a tumor-suppressor gene in breast and colorectal cancer cells.37 Dunwell et al.38 demonstrated frequent SLIT2 methylation in hematologic malignancies (both chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia)	 hence providing further evidence to support a role for SLIT2 in cancer development.  NRP1	 a receptor involved in axon guidance	 is also expressed in human DCs and resting T cells.17 Interestingly	 earlier studies have shown that NRP1 can have a role in the primary immune response during the formation of immunological synapse between DCs and resting T cells. The preincubation of DCs	 but also of resting T cells with blocking NRP1 antibodies inhibited the DC-induced proliferation of T cells. Thus	 the mutation in NRP1 gene may affect the activation status or proliferation capacity of T cells.  These novel mutations affecting either the STAT3 or the T-cell activation pathway were not detected in additional patients in our screening cohort (n=113). It could be that the STAT3/STAT5 mutation-negative patients are a more heterogeneous patient cohort	 and therefore no similar dominant mutations (such as STAT3) will be found in this group. However	 in the screening assays	 the primers covered only the mutation spots and nearby base pairs	 and it is possible that by screening the whole genes	 some additional mutations in the same genes will be found. Especially	 inactivating mutations in PTPRT warrant more extensive sequencing of the whole PTPRT gene as these mutations	 unlike activating mutations in STAT3	 do not cluster in hotspots.  In conclusion	 somatic mutations in PTPRT	 BCL11B	 SLIT2 and NRP1 represent potential genetic cause for LGL leukemia. The similarities in the gene expression profile and the observation of STAT3 phosphorylation in the bone marrow biopsy samples of patients without STAT3 mutations suggest that the novel LGL leukemia-associated mutations lead to the activation of STAT3 pathway and to similar disease phenotype as seen in patients with actual activating STAT3 mutations.  Protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) receptor T (PTPRT) is the most frequently mutated PTP in human cancers. However	 the cell signaling pathways regulated by PTPRT have not yet been elucidated. Here	 we report identification of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) as a substrate of PTPRT. Phosphorylation of a tyrosine at amino acid Y705 is essential for the function of STAT3	 and PTPRT specifically dephosphorylated STAT3 at this position. Accordingly	 overexpression of normal PTPRT in colorectal cancer cells reduced the expression of STAT3 target genes. These studies illuminate a mechanism regulating the STAT3 pathway and suggest that this signaling pathway plays an important role in colorectal tumorigenesis.  Keywords: colorectal cancer	 tyrosine phosphorylation	 signaling Tyrosine phosphorylation is coordinately controlled by protein tyrosine kinases and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) and is a central feature of many signaling pathways involved in tumor development (1). While activating mutations in protein tyrosine kinases have been shown to play vital roles in tumorigenesis	 the role of PTPs is less well defined. We recently identified PTP receptor T (PTPRT)	 also known as PTPÏ	 as the most frequently mutated PTP gene in colorectal cancers (CRCs) (2). PTPRT was also mutationally altered in lung and gastric cancers (2). The spectrum of mutations	 which included nonsense mutations and frameshift changes	 suggested that these alterations were inactivating. Biochemical analyses demonstrated that missense mutations in the catalytic domains of PTPRT diminished its phosphatase activity and overexpression of PTPRT inhibited CRC cell growth (2). Taken together	 these studies strongly support the notion that PTPRT normally acts as a tumor suppressor gene. This conclusion was buttressed by a transposon-based somatic mutagenesis screen in mice	 wherein PTPRT was isolated as a target gene from two different mouse transgenic sarcomas (3). In light of these data	 it is important to understand the mechanisms through which PTPRT is involved in the neoplastic process. Identifying substrates of PTPRT is an important step to elucidating the signal transduction pathways regulated by this phosphatase. Here	 we report identification of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) as a substrate of PTPRT.  STAT3 has been shown to play an important role in leukemias	 and persistent STAT3 activation has been detected in a variety of hematopoietic malignancies and solid tumors (4â€“6)	 including CRCs (7	 8). In general	 latent cytoplasmic STAT3 becomes activated through phosphorylation of amino acid residue Y705 by cytokine receptor-associated kinase (Jak) or growth factor receptor-associated tyrosine kinase (Src) (6). Phosphorylated STAT3 dimerizes through reciprocal Src homology 2â€“phosphotyrosine interaction and accumulates in the nucleus (6). STAT3 then activates the transcription of a wide array of genes	 including Bcl-XL and SOCS3 (4). In the current study	 we demonstrate that PTPRT specifically dephosphorylates Y705 residue of STAT3 and regulates its target gene expression and its cellular localization in CRC cells.  Go to: RESULTS AND DISCUSSION STAT3 Is a Substrate of PTPRT. To identify potential substrates of PPTRT	 we generated two ecdysone-inducible HEK293T cell lines: one expressing the intracellular part containing the two phosphatase domains of PTPRT and the other expressing the extracellular portion of the protein. We used the proteomic approach developed by Rush et al. (9) to globally profile tyrosine phosphopeptides in the two cell lines and parental HEK293T cells (see Materials and Methods). Phosphopeptides derived from five different proteins were present in parental HEK293T cells and cells expressing the extracellular portion of PTPRT but not in cells expressing the intracellular portion. We chose STAT3 of the five candidate substrates for further study	 because STAT3 was known to be involved in tumorigenesis.  Importantly	 the phosphorylation site identified in our proteomic profiling was Y705	 the residue known to be critical for activation of STAT3 signal transduction. To confirm that PTPRT regulates phosphorylation of Y705	 lysates from the inducible cell lines were probed with antibodies specific for the phosphorlyated form of Y705. As shown in Fig. 1A	 STAT3 phosphorylation was reduced â‰ˆ5-fold by induction of the phosphatase domain PTPRT but was unaffected by induction of the extracellular domain. Expression of full-length PTPRT also led to STAT3 dephosphorylation of Y705 in HEK293T cells (Fig. 1B). To test whether PTPRT regulates STAT3 phosphorylation under physiological conditions	 we knocked down PTPRT expression by â‰ˆ80% in MCF-7 cells by using siRNA specifically against PTPRT. As shown in Fig. 1C	 STAT3 phosphorylation increased â‰ˆ3-fold in cells transfected with PTPRT siRNA compared with cells transfected with a scrambled siRNA control.  Fig. 1. Fig. 1. STAT3 is a substrate of PTPRT. (A) Cell lysates from inducible cell lines expressing either the intracellular (Intra) or extracellular fragment (Extra) of PTPRT were probed with antibodies specific for pY705 of STAT3. The same membrane was stripped and ... Although the initiators of STAT3 signal transduction in some cell types	 particularly of hematopoietic lineage	 are well known	 STAT3 transduction has not been studied in depth in colorectal epithelial cells. In particular	 ligands that trigger STAT3 activation in such cells were not known. To address this issue	 we used the CRC cell line HCT116 to assess the effects of cytokines and growth factors that were known to induce STAT3 activation in other cell types (see Materials and Methods). Among the factors examined	 the only one that activated STAT3 was IL-6. Because IL-6 plays a direct role in promoting the growth of CRC cells (10	 11)	 it was important to determine whether PTPRT regulates STAT3 activation in CRC cells stimulated with IL-6. As shown in Fig. 1D	 expression of PTPRT reduced STAT3 activation by â‰ˆ3-	 8-	 and 10-fold that of GFP controls after 60	120	 and 180 min of IL-6 stimulation	 respectively. Note that only the phosphorylation status of STAT3	 not its total levels	 was affected by PTPRT	 thereby excluding protein degradation as a cause of these effects. Other controls were provided by STAT1 and STAT5. No STAT1 protein could be detected in these cells	 with or without exposure to IL-6	 and STAT5 phosphorylation was not altered by IL-6 or PTPRT (Fig. 1E). The activation of STAT3 by IL-6 was not confined to HCT116	 as three additional CRC cell lines each showed dramatic induction of phosphorlyated STAT3 by IL-6 without any change in the level of total STAT3 proteins (Fig. 1 Fâ€“I).  STAT3 Is a Direct Substrate of PTPRT. We have demonstrated unambiguously that PTPRT regulates STAT3 phosphorylation	 but did not prove that the dephosphorylation was directly mediated by PTPRT rather than through another phosphatase downstream of PTRPT. To address this point	 we used a substrate-trapping assay modified from that described for investigation of an unrelated phosphatase (PTP1B) (12). Three GST fusion proteins were constructed for this purpose. All contained both phosphatase domains of PTPRT	 but two of them (TRAP-1 and TRAP-2) contained mutations predicted to result in substrate trapping (D1074A in TRAP-1 and C1106S and D1074A in TRAP-2). The recombinant GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli	 and equal amounts of each were attached to beads (Fig. 2A). The beads were then incubated with cell lysates from SW480 CRC cells. The phosphorylated form of STAT3 was specifically bound by the two substrate trapping mutants but not by the WT or control GST proteins. In contrast	 STAT5 was not bound by the substrate trapping mutants (Fig. 2B). Similar results were also observed with cell lysates from HEK293T cells and HT29 CRC cells (Fig. 2C). Furthermore	 to test whether PTPRT directly dephosphorylates pSTAT3 in vitro	 we incubated pSTAT3 that immunoprecipitated from HEK293T cells as phosphatase substrates with equal amounts of WT	 TRAP-2 mutant	 or GST proteins with or without phosphatase inhibitor Na3VO4. STAT3 was dephosphorylated by WT but not the phosphatase dead mutant (TRAP-2) or GST alone (Fig. 2D). This activity was also inhibited by Na3VO4	 indicating that it was phosphatase dependent (Fig. 2D).  Fig. 2. Fig. 2. STAT3 is a direct substrate of PTPRT. (A) Coomassie-stained gels of GST fusion proteins eluted from the indicated beads before their incubation with cell lysates. The arrow indicates the fusion proteins. (B) SW480 cell lysates were incubated with beads ... PTPRT Regulates STAT3 Activity. Phosphorylated STAT3 is thought to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription of its target genes	 including Bcl-XL and SOCS3 (4). To determine whether dephosphorylation of STAT3 by PTPRT affects expression of such target genes	 CRC cells were exposed to IL-6 and then treated with the PTPRT adenovirus. As shown in Fig. 3A	 Bcl-XL and SOCS3 protein expression was induced by IL-6 in HCT116 CRC cells	 as predicted. Moreover	 their expression levels were down-regulated >4-fold by PTPRT.  Fig. 3. Fig. 3. Regulation of STAT3 activity by PTPRT. (A) HCT116 cells were infected with adenoviruses expressing PTPRT or GFP	 starved for 24 h	 and then stimulated with IL-6. Lysates were used in Western blots to assess the levels of the indicated proteins. (B) Schematic ... PTPRT consists of an extracelluar domain	 a juxtamembrane region	 and two phosphatase domains called D1 and D2 (Fig. 3B). To determine which of the phosphatase domains is required for STAT3 dephosphorylation	 adenoviruses expressing PTPRT devoid of the second domain (Del D2) or devoid of both domains (Del D1D2) were generated (Fig. 3B). Each of these PTPRT proteins contained a V5 epitope tag at its C terminus to allow comparison of PTPRT expression levels after infection of HCT116 CRC cells. Expression of the WT PTPRT led to a substantial reduction of phosphoryation of pSTAT3 (Fig. 3C) and an equivalent reduction of expression of the STAT3 targets Bcl-XL and SOCS3 (Fig. 3D). It is generally believed that the second phosphatase domains (D2) of receptor PTPs do not have functionally significant phosphatase activity (13). However	 the results in Fig. 3 C and D show that deletion of D2 was associated with a decrease of PTPRT activity compared with WT. This reduction could result from either the loss of an intrinsic enzymatic activity of D2	 the disruption of the functional communication between D2 and D1 (14	 15)	 or a perturbation of the structure of the PTPRT protein upon deletion of its D2 domain.  PTPRT Regulates STAT3 Cellular Localization. Phosphosphorylated STAT3 is known to dimerize and translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus before binding to the promoter of its target genes. To examine the effect of PTPRT on the subcellular localization of STAT3	 we examined the cells described in the above experiment with immunofluorescence. Note that the adenoviruses used for these experiments were constructed with the AdEasy system (16)	 so each coexpressed GFP	 allowing distinction between infected and noninfected cells. STAT3 proteins translocated into nuclei after IL-6 stimulation in cells infected with the control GFP virus (Fig. 4). However	 STAT3 staining remained diffuse	 throughout the cytoplasm	 after expression of WT PTPRT	 whether or not the cells were treated with IL-6. In contrast	 there was no effect on STAT3 translocation after IL-6 stimulation in cells expressing the PTPRT devoid of both its phosphatase domains (Fig. 4).  Fig. 4. Fig. 4. PTPRT regulates STAT3 cellular localization. HCT116 cells were infected with adenoviruses expressing GFP or the indicated forms of PTPRT. Virus-infected cells were starved for 24 h and then stimulated with or without IL-6 for 30 min. Immunofluorescent ... Regulation of Y705 phosphorylation is critical for STAT3 activation (6). Although the kinases that phosphorylate Y705 of STAT3 have been studied extensively	 the phosphatases that dephosphorylate this critical residue have not been clearly defined. It has been reported that the T cell PTP (TC-PTP) can regulate STAT3 phosphorylation (17)	 but it was not clear whether TC-PTP specifically dephosphorylates the pY705 residue. Most recently	 the low molecular weight-dual specificity phosphatase (LMW-DSP2) has been shown to regulate Y705 phosphorylation of STAT3 (18). However	 no evidence indicates that STAT3 is a direct substrate of LMW-DSP2. Furthermore	 neither of the two previously studied phosphatases plays a role in epithelial cell growth. From the results of the current study	 it is clear not only that STAT3 is a direct substrate of PTPRT but also that PTPRT specifically regulates Y705 phosphorylation of STAT3	 the ability of STAT3 to transcriptionally activate its target genes and the subcellular localization of STAT3.  How a membrane-localized PTPRT gains access and dephosphorylates STAT3 is an interesting question raised by this study. We propose that PTPRT dephosphorylates pSTAT3 through three possible mechanisms. One is that dephosphorylation of pSTAT3 by PTPRT occurs at the time when STAT3 is activated by receptor-associated kinases	 such as Jaks and SRC. The second is that PTPRT dephosphorylates the pSTAT3 pool by taking advantage of the STAT3 shuttling mechanism. A recent study has indicated that STAT3 constitutively shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus (19). Finally	 PTPRT	 like the notch proteins (20)	 could be cleaved by a protease after activation and the intracellular portion containing the phosphatase domains could translocate into nucleus and dephosphorylate STAT3. Further study is needed to define the mechanism through which PTPRT gains access to pSTAT3.  In summary	 our data suggest that the STAT3 pathway may play an important role in the growth of CRC cells. Moreover	 our results have obvious therapeutic implications	 as one could imagine inhibiting CRC growth through inhibition of STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation. Finally	 the proteomic approach described in this study may be applicable to the identification of substrates of other PTPs.  																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
1	57||The receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase T (PTPRT/PTPÏ) is the most frequently mutated tyrosine phosphatase in human cancer. PTPÏ mediates homophilic cell-cell aggregation. In its extracellular region	 PTPÏ has cell adhesion molecule-like motifs	 including a MAM domain	 an immunoglobulin domain and four fibronectin type III (FNIII) repeats. Tumor-derived mutations have been identified in all of these extracellular domains. Previously	 we determined that tumor-derived mutations in the MAM and immunoglobulin domains of PTPÏ reduce homophilic cell-cell aggregation. In this manuscript	 we describe experiments in which we evaluated the contribution of the FNIII repeats to PTPÏ-mediated cell-cell adhesion. Our results demonstrate that deletion of the FNIII repeats of PTPÏ result in defective cell-cell aggregation. Furthermore	 all of the tumor-derived mutations in the FNIII repeats of PTPÏ also disrupt cell-cell aggregation. These results further support the hypothesis that mutational inactivation of PTPÏ may lead to cancer progression by disrupting cell-cell adhesion.  Keywords: Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase	 PTPRT	 PTPÏ	 fibronectin type III repeat	 cell-cell aggregation	 cell-cell adhesion Go to: 1. Introduction Cancer progression and metastasis is in part influenced by changes in cell adhesion and tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) (Paschos et al. 2009; Wheelock et al. 2008)	 as well as tyrosine kinases and tyrosine phosphatases	 respectively (Freiss and Vignon 2004; Ostman et al. 2006). Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) comprise a family of proteins that have extracellular CAM domains coupled to cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatase domains	 and thus can impact cancer progression by regulating both cell adhesion and tyrosine phosphorylation (Brady-Kalnay 2001; Ostman et al. 2006).  The type IIB PTPÎ¼-like subfamily of RPTPs includes PTPÎ¼	 PTPÏ	 PTPÎº	 and PCP-2 (PTPÎ») (Aricescu et al. 2008; Brady-Kalnay 2001). The extracellular segment of the PTPÎ¼-like RPTPs contain motifs found in CAMs	 including a MAM domain	 an immunoglobulin (Ig) domain and four fibronectin type III (FNIII) repeats (Aricescu et al. 2008; Brady-Kalnay 2001; Ostman et al. 2006). PTPÎ¼ subfamily members bind homophilically (i.e. the â€œligandâ€ for PTPÎ¼ is an identical PTPÎ¼ molecule on an adjacent cell) (Brady-Kalnay et al. 1993; Cheng et al. 1997; Gebbink et al. 1993; Sap et al. 1994; Yu et al. 2008; Zondag et al. 1995). The Ig domain of PTPÎ¼ is responsible for promoting homophilic interactions (Brady-Kalnay and Tonks 1994)	 and proper cell surface localization (Del Vecchio and Tonks 2005). However	 both the MAM and Ig domains as well as the first two FNIII repeats are required for efficient cell-cell adhesion of PTPÎ¼ (Aricescu et al. 2006; Aricescu et al. 2007; Aricescu et al. 2008; Brady-Kalnay and Tonks 1994; Cismasiu et al. 2004; Zondag et al. 1995). PTPÏ and PTPÎº also mediate homophilic cell-cell adhesion (Sap et al. 1994; Yu et al. 2008). However	 PCP2 has not yet been demonstrated to mediate cell-cell adhesion or aggregation although in vitro binding studies indicate it can bind homophilically (Cheng et al. 1997).  All type IIB RPTPs are potential tumor suppressor genes (Burgoyne et al. 2009a; Flavell et al. 2008; McArdle et al. 2001; Yan et al. 2006). Notably	 PTPÏ is the most frequently mutated phosphatase gene in human cancers including colon	 lung	 skin and stomach cancers (Forbes et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2004). Defective adhesion mediated by PTPÏ may be at least one mechanism of cancer progression. In fact	 cancer derived mutations in the MAM and Ig domains of PTPÏ are defective in mediating cell-cell aggregation (Yu et al. 2008).  In addition to the tumor-derived mutations in the MAM and Ig domains of PTPÏ previously described (Wang et al. 2004; Yu et al. 2008)	 the majority of extracellular domain mutations are located in the FNIII repeats of PTPÏ (Wang et al. 2004). Given the importance of FNIII repeats in PTPÎ¼-mediated adhesion and aggregation (Aricescu et al. 2007)	 we tested the contribution of the FNIII repeats of PTPÏ to PTPÏ-mediated adhesion. We determined that deletion constructs where each of the extracellular domains of PTPÏ is removed	 including the FNIII repeats	 are defective in mediating cell-cell aggregation of Sf9 cells. Furthermore	 when we engineered the cancer-derived mutations in the FNIII repeats of these PTPÏ mutant proteins	 they also result in defective cell-cell aggregation. These results demonstrate the importance of the FNIII repeats in contributing to proper cell-cell adhesion and suggest that adhesion mediated by PTPÏ is likely important for the tumor suppressor activity of PTPÏ.

Materials and methods 2.1 Baculovirus generation  Baculoviruses were generated by transfecting cells with the BaculoGoldâ„¢ Linearized Baculovirus DNA (BD Biosciences	 San Diego	 CA) according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. The baculovirus for wild-type PTPÏ was previously described (Yu et al. 2008).  2.2 Sf9 cell culture  Insect Sf9 cells from (BD Biosciences) were maintained at 27Â°C in Graces Insect Medium (BD Biosciences). The medium was supplemented with 10% FBS from (Hyclone	 Logan	 UT) and Gentamicin (MP Biomedicals	 Solon	 OH). Viruses were added to Sf9 cell medium to induce the expression of proteins of interest. Cells were harvested 30 hours post-infection for further analysis.  2.3 Generation of PTPRT deletion constructs  The PTPÏ-Î”MAM	 PTPÏ-Î”Ig	 PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-1	 PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-2	 PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-3 and PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-4 constructs were generated by fusion PCR using the full-length PTPRT pVL1393-V5-His vector as the template. The primers 5â€™-GAAGATCTATGGCGAGCCTCGCCGCG-3â€™ and 5â€™-CCGGAATTCGGATCCTGGGGCGCTCTGAGCCCGGG-3â€™ were used to generate the PTPÏ-Î”MAM construct; the primers 5â€™-GCGTGGGAGGCTCTCTGCATGGATGAGCAAGGAC-3â€™ and 5â€™-CAATGGGTCTTGCTCATCCATGCAGAGAGCCTCCCACGCCCATTG-3â€™ were used to generate the PTPÏ-Î”Ig construct; the primers 5â€™-CTGCACACTTGGTCCTGGTTTTCACGATCAGCTCCGCGTA-3â€™ and 5â€™-TACGCGGAGCGTCGTGAAAACCAGGACCAAGTGTGCAG-3â€™ were used to generate the PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-1 construct; the primers 5â€™-CCGCCAGGGCCTCCCCTCACCGAGGAAGACGTTCCAGGAG-3â€™ and 5â€™-CTCCTGGAACGTCTTCCTCGGTGAGGGGAGGCCCTGGCGG-3â€™ were used to generate the PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-2 construct; the primers 5â€™-GAGGAGCTGGTGGTGCAGACTAAAATTTCAGCTCCATCCA-3â€™ and 5â€™-TGGATGGAGCTGAAATTTTAGTCTGCACCACCAGCTCCTC-3â€™ were used to generate the PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-3 construct and the 5â€™-GTCACCACTCGGATTGCCACCGGTGCCTCCACCCAGAATT-3â€™ and 5â€™-AATTCTGGGTGGAGGCACCGGTGGCAATCCGAGTGGTGAC-3â€™ were used to generate the PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-4 construct.  2.4 Immunoblotting  Sf9 cells were lysed in a standard lysis buffer (20 mM TrisÂ·HCl	 pH 7.5	 1% Triton X-100	 150 mM sodium chloride	 2 mM Benzamidine	 2.5Î¼g/ml Aprotinin	 2.5Î¼g/ml Leupeptin	 and 0.5Î¼g/ml Pepstatin). Samples were solubilized in 2X SDS loading buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Samples were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman	 Piscataway	 NJ) and immunoblotted with SK18 (Brady-Kalnay et al. 1993)	 which cross-reacts with PTPÏ.  2.5 Cell surface expression of PTPÏ  Cell surface expression of PTPÏ protein in baculovirus infected Sf9 cells was determined using a modified biotin-avidin reaction with the Cell Surface Protein Isolation Kit (catalog# 89991	 Pierce	 Rockford	 IL)	 as previously described (Yu et al. 2008). Briefly	 Sf9 cell media was removed and the flasks were incubated with rocking for 30 minutes at 4Â°C in 5ml of 0.25mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin in 1X PBS. The cells were mechanically removed from the flask	 centrifuged	 washed	 and lysed according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocols. To isolate cell surface expressed PTPÏ the cell lysate was added to a NeutrAvidin Gel column and incubated for 60 min at room temperature (RT) with rocking prior to washing and eluting proteins with 200Î¼l of sample buffer containing a final concentration of 55mM DTT for 60min at RT. The flow through was run on 6% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Total cell surface protein levels were normalized by immunoblotting cell lysates with an anti-actin antibody (JLA20). The normalized cell surface protein was run on 6% SDS-PAGE gels	 transferred to nitrocellulose and immunoblotted with antibodies to PTPÎ¼ that also recognized PTPÏ (SK18) followed by secondary antibody conjugated to HRP. The HRP signal was detected using a Fluor-S MAX MultiImager (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.	 Hercules	 CA).  2.6 Aggregation Assays  Sf9 cells were harvested by trituration. The cell suspensions were added to glass scintillation vials and incubated at 27Â°C at 90 rpm in a gyratory shaker for 30 minutes. For a given condition	 the cell suspension was transferred to a 100mm petri dish either prior to (0 time point) or 30 minutes after aggregation. Images were captured at 10X magnification with a Nikon TE-200 inverted fluorescent microscope (Tokyo	 Japan). To quantify cell aggregates	 pictures of four randomly selected fields were taken per dish. The area of each object (single cells and aggregates) was determined by the Metamorph software (Molecular Devices) using an auto-threshold setting for light objects and appropriate size filters that allowed the counting of cells and aggregates but not debris. The four replicates were combined to yield average readings per condition. The percent aggregation was then calculated as the average aggregate area at 30 minutes minus the average aggregate area at zero minutes divided by the average aggregate area at 30 minutes [(N30-N0)/N30]. A minimum of three independent experiments was performed per condition. Statistical significance was determined in Microsoft Excel using Studentâ€™s T-test. Error bars indicate standard error.  2.7 Site-directed mutagenesis  The I395V	 Y412F	 R453C	 Q479E	 S492F	 N510K	 T605M	 V648G	 A707T	 and L708P tumor-derived mutations (Wang et al. 2004) were generated by fusion PCR using the full-length PTPRT pVL1393-V5-His vector as the template. The primers 5â€™-TGGCCCACAGAACGTGGAAGTCGTAGACATCAGAGCC-3â€™ and 5â€™-CTTCCACGTTCTGTGGGCCA-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the I395V mutant; the primers 5â€™-CAGTGGGAGCCCTTCGGCTTCGCGGTGACCCGCTGCCAT-3â€™ and 5â€™-AAGCCGAAGGGCTCCCACTG-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the Y412F mutant; the primers 5â€™-CTACACCCTGCGAGGCCTGTGCCCCTTCATGACCATCCG-3â€™ and 5â€™-ACAGGCCTCGCAGGGTGTAG-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the R453C mutant; the primers 5â€™-GAGCGAGGAGCTGGTGGTGGAGACTGAGGAAGACGTTCC-3â€™ and 5â€™-CCACCACCAGCTCCTCGCTC-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the Q479E mutant; the primers 5â€™-TGTTCCTCTAGAATTCATCCAAGGGGGGCCCT TT-3â€™ and 5â€™-ATGAATTCTAGAGGAACA-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the S492F mutant; the primers 5â€™-TCCAGTGGAAACCTCCCAAGGAGACCAATGGGGTCATCA-3â€™ and 5â€™-CTTGGGAGGTTTCCACTGGA-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the N510K mutant; the primers 5â€™-CCATTGAATGAGACAGACATGACC ATCACAGTGATGCTG3-â€™ and 5â€™-ATGTCTGTCTCATTCAATGG-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the T605M mutant; the primers 5â€™-ATTATTGAGTGCTTTTC GGGGCCCGTGAGCTATCGGAAT-3â€™ and 5â€™-CCCGAAAAGCACTCAATAAT-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the V648G mutant; the primers 5â€™-CTACAGCATCTACTTCCAGACACTCAGCAAAGCCAATGG-3â€™ and 5â€™-TCTGGAAGTAGATGCTGTAG-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the A707T mutant; the primers 5â€™-AGCATCTACTTCCAGGCACCCAGCAAAGCCAATGGAGAG-3â€™ and 5â€™-GGTGCCTGGAAGTAGATGCT-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the L708P mutant.  2.8 Mapping of PTPÏ mutations onto the PTPÎ¼ crystal structure  The sequence of PTPÎ¼ and PTPÏ were aligned using CLUSTALW. Mutations probed in this study were mapped using this sequence alignment onto the PTPÎ¼ structure (PDB ID: 2V5Y). The figure was prepared utilizing PyMOL 1.2r1 (http://pymol.org).  Go to: 3. Results 3.1 Deletions in the MAM	 Ig	 and FNIII repeat domains of PTPÏ result in defective cell-cell aggregation  To test whether a protein mediates cell-cell aggregation or adhesion	 one has to express the protein of interest in the non-adhesive cells. Otherwise	 one cannot measure the aggregation or adhesion of a single molecule in the sea of other adhesion molecules naturally expressed in adhesive cells. This is the main reason that the non-adhesive Sf9 or Drosophila S2 cells are widely used models for such studies. To our knowledge	 nearly all cell lines of epithelial origin are adhesive cells and thus are not suitable for these studies. Introduction of putative adhesion molecules into non-adhesive Drosophila S2 insect cells has been used to demonstrate adhesive functions for fasciclin II	 connectin	 Dtrk	 ARK	 Neuroglian	 and Capricious molecules directly (Bellosta et al. 1995; Hortsch et al. 1995; Nose et al. 1992; Pulido et al. 1992; Shinza-Kameda et al. 2006; Snow et al. 1989). In a similar approach	 we and others demonstrated that the full-length form of PTPÎ¼ induced aggregation	 via a homophilic binding mechanism	 when expressed in nonadhesive Sf9 insect cells	 which are derived from the Fall army-worm Spodoptera frugiperda (Brady-Kalnay et al. 1993; Gebbink et al. 1993; Zondag et al. 1995). We have also used this system for analyzing PTPRT/PTP rho (Yu et al.	 2008). Examples of other cell adhesion molecules that have been studied in Sf9 cells include L1 (Gouveia et al. 2008)	 Galectin-3 (Inohara and Raz 1995) and C-CAM1 (Phan et al. 2001). Insect S2 and Sf9 cells are extremely useful systems to analyze adhesive mechanisms of cell adhesion molecules.  The MAM domain	 Ig domain	 and first two-FNIII repeats are essential for PTPÎ¼ cell-cell aggregation (Brady-Kalnay and Tonks 1994; Zondag et al. 1995). To test whether these domains are the minimal essential regions required for PTPÏ cell-cell aggregation	 baculoviral PTPÏ deletion constructs of the MAM domain	 Ig domain	 and each of the four individual FNIII repeats were made and expressed in non-adhesive Sf9 insect cells (Figure 1). All the PTPÏ deletion constructs were expressed and appropriately trafficked to the cell surface (Figure 1). To test whether these domains contribute to PTPÏ-dependent adhesion	 Sf9 cells were evaluated for their ability to mediate cell-cell aggregation when expressing the deletion constructs. Aggregation assays with Sf9 cells expressing the deletion constructs were conducted alongside aggregation assays using Sf9 cells expressing wild-type PTPÏ	 which mediates cell-cell aggregation (Figure 2) and serves as a positive control (Yu et al. 2008). Deletion of any of the extracellular domains of PTPÏ resulted in defective cell-cell aggregation compared to aggregation of wild-type PTPÏ expressing Sf9 cells (Figure 2). Deletion of the fourth FNIII repeat was the least severe where ~23% aggregation was observed. Deletion of the MAM domain	 Ig domain and FNIII repeats 1	 2 or 3 resulted in 5â€“16% aggregation. When the level of aggregation was quantified	 we determined that all of the deletion constructs resulted in a large and statistically significant reduction in cell-cell aggregation (Figure 2	 p-value<0.005). Together with our previous study	 these results demonstrate that all of the extracellular domains of PTPÏ are necessary for PTPÏ-mediated cell-cell aggregation.  Figure 1 Figure 1 PTPÏ deletion constructs are all expressed at the cell surface. Constructs containing deletions of one extracellular domain of PTPÏ each were generated and expressed in Sf9 cells. Total cellular protein and cell surface protein were isolated ... Figure 2 Figure 2 Deletion of any of the extracellular domains of PTPÏ disrupts cell-cell aggregation. Sf9 cells expressing deletion constructs of the individual extracellular domains of PTPÏ were allowed to aggregate for 30 minutes prior to imaging. Scale ... 3.2 Tumor-Derived PTPÏ Mutations in the FNIII repeats result in defective cell-cell aggregation  We next tested the effects of human tumor-derived mutations in the FNIII repeats of PTPÏ on PTPÏ-mediated cell-cell aggregation. We recently demonstrated that tumor-derived mutations in the MAM and Ig domains of PTPÏ are defective in cell-cell aggregation using the Sf9 aggregation assay (Yu et al. 2008)	 and given the above results	 we hypothesized that mutations in the FNIII domains would likewise result in defective aggregation. Ten human tumor-derived mutations are located in the second	 third and fourth FNIII repeats of PTPÏ (Wang et al. 2004). To test whether these mutations also affect cell-cell aggregation	 we engineered the ten human mutations by site-directed mutagenesis using the full-length PTPÏ baculoviral construct as a template (see Figure 3). The ten mutations are expressed in Sf9 cells at the expected molecular weight and at similar levels to full-length human PTPÏ (Figure 3). All of these mutants are expressed at the cell surface (Figure 3). When these mutant PTPÏ proteins were expressed in Sf9 cells and tested in aggregation assays	 we observed that all of the mutant PTPÏ proteins resulted in fewer and smaller aggregates than wild type PTPÏ (Figure 4). When the level of aggregation was quantified	 we determined that all of the FNIII mutations significantly reduced cell-cell aggregation (16â€“43%) compared to cells expressing wild type PTPÏ (68% aggregation	 p-value<0.008	 Figure 4).  Figure 3 Figure 3 PTPÏ proteins containing tumor-derived mutations in their FNIII domains are expressed at the cell surface. Ten mutations in the FNIII domains of PTPÏ were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in Sf9 cells. Total cellular ... Figure 4 Figure 4 Tumor derived mutations in FNIII domains of PTPÏ are defective in cell-cell aggregation. Sf9 cells expressing the mutated PTPÏ proteins were allowed to aggregate for 30 minutes prior to imaging. Scale bar equals 100Î¼m. The percentage ... Go to: 4. Discussion PTPRT/PTPÏ is the most highly mutated tyrosine phosphatase in human colon carcinomas. We and others found that PTPRT/ PTPÏ is also mutated in lung	 gastric and skin (melanoma) cancers (Forbes et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2004). The spectrum of mutations	 which included nonsense mutations and frameshifts	 suggested that these mutations were inactivating (Wang et al. 2004). Biochemical analyses demonstrated that missense mutations in the catalytic domains of PTPRT diminished its phosphatase activity and overexpression of PTPRT inhibited colon cancer cell growth. Moreover	 we showed previously that the tumor-derived mutations in the MAM and Ig domains of PTPÏ are defective in cell-cell adhesion (Yu et al. 2008). All these data suggest that PTPRT/PTPÏ normally functions as a tumor suppressor gene. The experiments presented in this manuscript evaluate the contribution of the individual extracellular domains of PTPÏ to PTPÏ-mediated adhesion. We demonstrate that in addition to the MAM and Ig domains	 the FNIII repeats are required for PTPÏ-mediated adhesion. Importantly	 we also show that PTPÏ-mediated adhesion is impaired by human tumor-derived mutations in those FNIII repeats. These studies indicate that all the tumor-derived mutations located in the extracellular domain of PTPRT are loss-of-function mutations	 thereby providing further evidence that PTPRT is a tumor suppressor. This notion is further supported by our recent study showing that PTPRT knockout mice are highly susceptible to colon specific carcinogen azoxymethane (AOM)-induced colon cancer (Zhao et al.).  PTPÎ¼-mediated cell-cell aggregation requires the MAM domain	 Ig domain	 and the first two FNIII repeats (Aricescu et al. 2006; Aricescu et al. 2007; Brady-Kalnay and Tonks 1994; Cismasiu et al. 2004; Zondag et al. 1995). The entire extracellular domain of PTPÎ¼ is predicted to make a rigid conformation with extensive interfaces between each of the domains (Aricescu et al. 2006). The minimal adhesive unit for functional cell-cell aggregation is the MAM domain	 Ig domain and the first two FNIII repeats (Aricescu et al. 2006; Brady-Kalnay and Tonks 1994; Zondag et al. 1995). However	 the FNIII repeats appear to play a role in spacing the key homophilic interaction domain(s) a certain distance from the plasma membrane. Deletion of the FNIII repeats changed the intercellular spacing of two apposing membranes (Aricescu et al. 2007). Cell-cell aggregation assays of the FNIII deletion constructs were not performed in that study (Aricescu et al. 2007). The amino acid residues of the interfaces between the extracellular domains are highly conserved between members of the type IIB RPTP subfamily (Aricescu et al. 2006; Aricescu et al. 2007) therefore it is likely that the PTPÏ adhesive interface resembles that of PTPÎ¼. Together our data support the hypothesis that the essential regions for PTPÏ-mediated adhesion resemble those of PTPÎ¼.  To gain insight into how the point mutations may alter the adhesive function of PTPÏ	 we modeled the human tumor derived PTPÏ mutations onto the crystal structure of PTPÎ¼ (Figure 5). The crystal structure of PTPÎ¼ includes only the first three FNIII repeats (Aricescu et al. 2007). Four of these mutations fall within the second FNIII (FNIII-2) repeat (I395V	 Y412F	 R453C	 Q479E). It is important to note that FNIII-2 is required for efficient cell-cell adhesion (Aricescu et al. 2006). Two of the mutations fall in the third FNIII (FNIII-3) repeat (S492F	 N510K). The mutation within the linker region between FNIII-1 and FNII-2 (Y412F) could alter the flexibility or positioning between the two domains. The other mutations (I395V R453C	 Q479E	 S492F	 N510K) appear to be clustered in surface exposed regions and/or near the linker regions between FNIII-2 and FNIII-3 that could alter flexibility	 position of individual FNIII repeats and/or protein-protein interactions. While these mutations do not correspond to the adhesive interface hypothesized for PTPÎ¼ based upon a single static crystal structure (Aricescu et al. 2007)	 some of the mutations fall within the FNIII-2 repeat which is required for adhesion	 and all of these surface modifications would likely alter either the three-dimensional topology and/or cis/trans interactions of PTPÏ.  Figure 5 Figure 5 Structural modeling of the point mutations of PTPÏ. The point mutations (indicated in red) evaluated in this manuscript were modeled onto the equivalent sites in the crystal structure of PTPÎ¼. The PTPÏ mutations likely alter cell-cell ... Other type IIB RPTPs also function as tumor suppressor genes	 by regulating adhesion and/or tyrosine phosphorylation of effector proteins. Expression of PTPÎ¼ is reduced in human glioblastomas (GBM) and cell lines (Burgoyne et al. 2009a). Reduction in full-length PTPÎ¼ expression with a concomitant increase in a proteolytically processed cytoplasmic fragment of PTPÎ¼ is observed in GBM cells and both are correlated with decreased adhesion and increased migration observed in the disease (Burgoyne et al. 2009a; Burgoyne et al. 2009b). Over-expression of the full-length form of PTPÎ¼ suppressed migration of GBM cells and reduces their survival (Burgoyne et al. 2009b). Of note	 at the same time that stable cell adhesion is reduced due to the loss of full-length PTPÎ¼ expression in GBM cells	 a catalytically active cytoplasmic fragment of PTPÎ¼ is released and translocates to the nucleus (Burgoyne et al. 2009b). Catalytic activity of this fragment is also necessary for cell migration and viability of GBM cells (Burgoyne et al. 2009b). Therefore	 both the tyrosine phosphatase activity of the cytoplasmic fragment of PTPÎ¼ and the loss of PTPÎ¼-mediated adhesion may contribute to the invasiveness of GBM cells.  PTPÎº is also implicated in tumor progression. PTPÎº expression is reduced in melanoma cell lines and human tissue biopsies (McArdle et al. 2001)	 and in Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma cells (Flavell et al. 2008). Over-expression of PTPÎº in Hodgkin lymphoma cells reduces cellular proliferation and survival (Flavell et al. 2008). Like PTPÎ¼	 PTPÎº is proteolytically processed (Anders et al. 2006)	 potentially as a result of aberrant glycosylation (Kim et al. 2006). It is not clear whether adhesion or catalytic activity of PTPÎº is required for its tumor suppressor activity (Flavell et al. 2008; Kim et al. 2006). Of note	 the cleaved cytoplasmic domain fragment of PTPÎº is catalytically active	 translocates to the nucleus and promotes Î²-catenin-mediated transcription (Anders et al. 2006). Signaling via the PTPÎº cytoplasmic fragment might augment the loss of stable cell-cell adhesion and may promote tumor progression.  Although speculative	 it is interesting to postulate that tyrosine phosphatase activity and or cleavage of PTPÏ will also be an important element of its tumor suppressor activity	 as has been demonstrated for PTPÎ¼ and PTPÎº. Interestingly	 we identified and validated STAT3 as a direct substrate of PTPRT (Zhang et al. 2007). STAT3 is latent transcription factor that translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus after being phosphorylated at the Y705 residue. It is possible that the cleaved intracellular fragment of PTPÏ	 which contains the phosphatase domains	 translocates to nucleus and dephosphorylates STAT3. Besco and colleagues found that PTPRT associates with the adhesion molecule E-cadherin and its binding partner p120 catenin	 which are PTPRT substrates (Besco et al. 2006). p120 also translocates to the nucleus and associates with the Kaiso transcription factor (Daniel and Reynolds 1999). Given the frequency and distribution of mutations in PTPRT/PTPÏ in human colon and other cancers	 a more thorough understanding of its biological function is warranted. 																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	58||Tyrosine phosphorylation	 regulated by protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) and kinases (PTKs)	 is important in signaling pathways underlying tumorigenesis. A mutational analysis of the tyrosine phosphatase gene superfamily in human cancers identified 83 somatic mutations in six PTPs (PTPRF	 PTPRG	 PTPRT	 PTPN3	 PTPN13	 PTPN14)	 affecting 26% of colorectal cancers and a smaller fraction of lung	 breast	 and gastric cancers. Fifteen mutations were nonsense	 frameshift	 or splice-site alterations predicted to result in truncated proteins lacking phosphatase activity. Five missense mutations in the most commonly altered PTP (PTPRT) were biochemically examined and found to reduce phosphatase activity. Expression of wild-type but not a mutant PTPRT in human cancer cells inhibited cell growth. These observations suggest that the mutated tyrosine phosphatases are tumor suppressor genes	 regulating cellular pathways that may be amenable to therapeutic intervention. Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues is a central feature of many cellular signaling pathways	 including those affecting growth	 differentiation	 cell cycle regulation	 apoptosis	 and invasion (1	 2). This phosphorylation is coordinately controlled by protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and phosphatases (PTPs). Although a variety of PTK genes have been directly linked to tumorigenesis through somatic activating mutations (3â€“6)	 only a few PTP genes have been implicated in cancer (7â€“10). Moreover	 it is not known how many or how frequently members of the PTP gene family are altered in any particular cancer type. We have systematically addressed these issues by comprehensive mutational analysis of the PTP gene superfamily in colorectal tumors.  The PTP gene superfamily is composed of three main families: (i) the classical PTPs	 including the receptor PTPs (RPTPs) and the nonreceptor PTPs (NRPTPs); (ii) the dual specificity phosphatases (DSPs)	 which can dephosphorylate serine and threonine in addition to tyrosine residues; and (iii) the low molecular weight phosphatases (LMPs) (1). Using an approach similar to that described in a recent bioinformatic analysis of PTPs in the mouse genome (11)	 we employed a combination of Hidden Markov Models representing catalytic domains of members of the PTP superfamily to identify 53 classical PTPs (21 RPTPs and 32 NRPTPs)	 33 DSPs	 and one LMP in the human genome (12). This analysis revealed a set of genes representing all known human PTPs (13) as well as seven putative PTPs.  As an initial screen to evaluate whether these phosphatases are genetically altered in human cancer	 we analyzed the coding exons of all 87 members of this gene superfamily in 18 colorectal cancers. A total of 1375 exons from all annotated RPTPs	 NRPTPs	 DSPs	 and LMPs were extracted from genomic databases (12). These exons were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from cancer genomic DNA samples and directly sequenced with dye terminator chemistry (12). Whenever a presumptive mutation was identified	 we attempted to determine whether it was somatically acquired (i.e.	 tumor specific) by examining the sequence of the gene in genomic DNA from normal tissue of the relevant patient.  From the 3.3 Mb of sequence information obtained	 we identified six genes containing somatic mutations	 including three members of the RPTP subfamily (PTPRF	 PTPRG	 and PTPRT) and three members of the NRPTP subfamily (PTPN3	 PTPN13	 and PTPN14). These six genes were then further analyzed for mutations in another 157 colorectal cancers. Through this strategy	 we identified 77 mutations in the six genes	 in aggregate affecting 26% of the colorectal tumors analyzed (table S1 and Fig. 1). Examination of these six genes in seven other tumor types identified PTPRT mutations in two of 11 (18%) lung cancers and two of 12 gastric cancers (17%)	 and PTPRF mutations in one of 11 (9%) lung cancers and one of 11 (9%) breast cancers. No mutations were identified in 12 pancreatic cancers	 12 ovarian cancers	 12 medulloblastomas	 or 12 glioblastomas (table S1 and Fig. 1). In total	 83 nonsynonymous mutations were observed	 all of which were somatic in the cancers that could be assessed (12).    Download high-res image  Open in new tab  Download Powerpoint Fig. 1.

Black stars indicate PTPRT mutants evaluated for phosphatase activity (Fig. 2)	 and the red star indicates PTPRT mutant evaluated for effects on cell proliferation (Fig. 3).  Fifteen of the 83 mutations were nonsense	 frameshift	 or splice-site alterations	 all of which were predicted to result in aberrant or truncated proteins. In 16 tumors both alleles of the phosphatase gene appeared to be mutated	 a characteristic often associated with tumor suppressor genes. The majority of tumors with PTP gene mutations also contained mutations in KRAS or BRAF	 and nine tumors contained alterations in previously reported tyrosine kinase genes (table S1). Thus	 the mutant phosphatases identified in this study are likely to operate through cellular pathways distinct from those associated with previously identified mutant kinases.  Analysis of mutations in tumors is complicated by the fact that mutations can arise either as functional alterations affecting key genes underlying the neoplastic process or as nonfunctional â€œpassengerâ€ changes. The multiple waves of clonal expansion and selection that occur throughout tumorigenesis lead to fixation of any mutation that had previously occurred in any predecessor cell	 regardless of whether the mutation was actually responsible for the clonal expansion. Two independent lines of evidence suggest that the sequence alterations we observed are functional. First	 the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations provides an indication of selection	 as synonymous alterations usually do not exert a growth advantage. There were no somatic synonymous mutations detected in the colorectal cancers analyzed	 resulting in a ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations of 77 to 0	 much higher than the expected 2:1 ratio for nonselected passenger mutations (P < 1 Ã— 10â€“6). Second	 the prevalence of mutations in the coding regions of the analyzed genes was âˆ¼19 per Mb of tumor DNA	 similar to the prevalence of functional somatic alterations observed in other gene families [e.g.	 the tyrosine kinome (6)] and significantly higher than the prevalence of nonfunctional alterations previously observed in the cancer genomes (âˆ¼1 per Mb	 P < 0.01) (14). These data support the idea that these mutations were the targets of selection during tumorigenesis.  The great majority of the nonsense and frameshift mutations (Fig. 1) would result in polypeptides devoid of C-terminal phosphatase catalytic domains	 thereby leading to inactivation of the phosphatase. To evaluate whether tumor-specific point mutations alter phosphatase activity	 we biochemically tested mutant versions of PTPRT	 the most frequently mutated PTP in the superfamily. Mutations in both intracellular PTP domains (D1 and D2) were evaluated. His-tagged versions of the catalytic region of wild-type PTPRT	 two D1 mutants (Q987K and N1128I)	 and three D2 mutants (R1212W	 R1346L	 and T1368M) were produced in bacteria and analyzed for phosphatase activity by using 6	8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (DiFMUP) as a substrate (Fig. 2) (12). All D1 and D2 mutants had reduced phosphatase activity compared with the wild-type protein (Fig. 2). The kinetic parameter Kcat was reduced in both D1 mutants	 while Km was increased in all three D2 mutants	 suggesting that mutations in the two domains may have different effects on enzymatic activity. Although it has been thought that the D2 domain is usually catalytically inactive (1)	 our results are consistent with recent studies that show that the D2 domain is important for phosphatase activity in some receptor phosphatases (15).

His-tagged versions of PTPRT protein segments comprising the two catalytic domains containing wild-type (WT) and tumor-specific mutant sequences were expressed in bacteria and purified using nickelaffinity chromatography. Equal amounts of WT and mutant proteins were used to evaluate enzyme kinetics. The rate of hydrolysis of substrate (DiFMUP) is plotted against increasing substrate concentration. Data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menton equation	 and the resulting kinetic parameters of WT and mutant proteins are indicated in (B).  These biochemical data on missense mutations	 coupled with the large number of truncating mutations	 suggested that PTPRT functions as a tumor suppressor gene. To determine whether PTPRT expression can inhibit tumor cell growth	 we transfected wild-type PTPRT into HCT116 colorectal cancer cells (12). An identical expression vector containing an R632X mutant of PTPRT was used for comparison. Wild-type PTPRT potently inhibited cell growth in this assay	 as seen by the substantial decrease in the number of neomycin-resistant colonies compared with the R632X mutant or with vector alone (Fig. 3	 A and B). Similar results with wild-type and mutant PTPRT were also observed in DLD1 colorectal cancer cells.    Download high-res image  Open in new tab  Download Powerpoint Fig. 3.

The photographs show colonies stained with crystal violet after 14 days of geneticin selection. (B) Number of resistant colonies (mean of two 25 cm2 flasks) for WT PTPRT	 mutant PTPRT	 and empty vector.  The combination of these genetic	 biochemical	 and cellular data suggest that PTPRT and the other identified phosphatases are likely to act as tumor suppressors. This is consistent with the function of other phosphatases implicated in tumorigenesis (7	8	 16) and with the general role of phosphatases in inhibiting various growth-promoting signaling pathways (2). The absence of biallelic mutations in a subset of the analyzed tumors suggests that some alterations may act in a dominant-negative fashion or may affect gene dosage	 mechanisms that have been previously involved in inactivation of other tumor suppressor genes (17	 18).  Little is known about the functional role of the tyrosine phosphatases discussed here. PTPN13 appears to be involved in apoptosis (19) and may be partly responsible for the antitumor effects of tamoxifen (20). Overexpression of PTPN3 inhibits growth of NIH/3T3 cells	 possibly through interaction with valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97) (21). PTPN14 and PTPRF are thought to play a role in cell adhesion by regulating tyrosine phosphorylation of adherens junction proteins (22	 23). Because increased phosphorylation of adherens junctions has been shown to increase cell motility and migration (22	 24)	 mutational inactivation of these genes may be an important step in cancer cell invasion and metastasis. PTPRG maps to chromosome 3p14.2	 a region frequently lost in lung	 renal	 and early-stage breast tumors	 and is thought to be a target of the translocation at 3p14 in familial renal cell carcinoma (25â€“27). However	 no point mutations in PTPRG (28) or any of the other genes identified here have been previously described in any cancer. PTPRT is expressed in the developing central nervous system and in the adult cerebellum (29) and had not been thought to play a role in the growth or differentiation of other tissues. We have found that PTPRT is expressed in a variety of human tissues	 including normal colon epithelium as well as cells derived from colorectal cancers (fig. S1).  Phosphatases affect signaling pathways that may be amenable to therapeutic intervention in cancer cells (2). Although reactivation of incapacitated phosphatases is likely to be pharmacologically challenging	 identification of the corresponding kinases that phosphorylate substrates normally regulated by the mutant phosphatases could provide novel therapeutic targets. Like the analysis of genetic alterations in tyrosine kinases (6)	 the present study suggests the possibility of individualized therapy based on the mutant phosphatases present in specific tumors. Conceivably	 this approach would have broad therapeutic use	 because more than 50% of colorectal tumors analyzed to date have alterations in at least one member of the tyrosine phosphatome or kinome. Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase T (PTPRT/PTPÏ) is frequently mutated in human cancers including colon	 lung	 gastric and skin cancers. More than half of the identified tumor-derived mutations are located in the extracellular part of PTPÏ. However	 the functional significance of those extracellular domain mutations remains to be defined. Here we report that the extracellular domain of PTPÏ mediates homophilic cell-cell aggregation. This homophilic interaction is very specific	 as PTPÏ does not interact with its closest homolog PTPÎ¼ in a cell aggregation assay. We further demonstrated that all 5 tumor-derived mutations located in the N-terminal MAM and Ig domains impair	 to varying extents	 their ability to from cell aggregates	 indicating that those mutations are loss-of-function mutations. Our results suggest that PTPÏ may play an important role in cell-cell adhesion and mutational inactivation of this phosphatase could promote tumor migration and metastasis.  Go to: Introduction Tyrosine phosphorylation is coordinately controlled by protein tyrosine kinases and phosphatases and is a central feature of many signaling pathways involved in tumor development (1). While activating mutations in protein tyrosine kinases have been shown to play vital roles in tumorigenesis (1)	 the role of phosphatases is less well-defined. We recently identified PTPRT	 also known as PTPÏ	 as the most frequently mutated PTP gene in colorectal cancers (CRCs) (2). PTPRT was also mutationally altered in lung	 gastric cancers and melanomas (2). The spectrum of mutations	 which included nonsense mutations and frameshifts	 suggested that these mutations were inactivating (2). Biochemical analyses demonstrated that missense mutations in the catalytic domains of PTPÏ diminished its phosphatase activity and overexpression of PTPÏ inhibited CRC cell growth (2). Taken together	 these studies strongly supported the notion that PTPÏ normally acts as a tumor suppressor gene. This conclusion was also supported by a transposon-based somatic mutagenesis screen in mice	 wherein PTPÏ was isolated as a target gene from two different mouse transgenic sarcomas (3).  PTPRT (PTPÏ) is a member of the type IIB receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) subfamily (4). Other members of this subfamily include PTPRM (PTPÎ¼)	 PTPRK (PTPÎº) and PCP2 (also called PTPÎ»	 PTPÏˆ	 PTPRO-omicron	 PTPÏ€	 hPTP-J) (5). These 4 RPTPs share the same domain structure: an extracelluar domain	 a juxtamembrane region and two phosphatase domains (6). The extracellular domains of type IIB RPTPs have high sequence identities (7	 8)	 all consist of a MAM (memprin/A5/PTPÎ¼) domain	 an Ig domain	 and four fibronectin type III (FNIII) repeats (6). The MAM domain is suggested to play a role in protein dimerization (6). The Ig domain is a disulfide structure that is found in many cell surface proteins and has been shown to mediate homophilic and heterophilic interactions between cell adhesion molecules (6). The FNIII motif was originally identified in the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin and later found to be present in many immunoglobulin superfamily cell adhesion molecules (6). We have identified ~15 somatic mutations that are localized in the extracellular domain of PTPRT/PTPÏ. How these mutations affect the functions of PTPÏ remains to be determined.  Three close homologs of PTPÏ	 PTPÎ¼	 PTPÎº and PTPÎ» (PCP-2)	 are known to mediate homophilic cell-cell adhesion (9â€“ 12). Expression of the full-length PTPÎ¼ (9) (10) or a construct encoding the extracellular	 transmembrane and 55 amino acids of the juxtamembrane domain of PTPÎ¼ in non-adhesive Sf9 insect cells induces cell aggregation (9). Furthermore	 homophilic binding of PTPÎ¼ was demonstrated between PTPÎ¼-coated fluorescent beads and cells that endogenously express PTPÎ¼ (9). The minimal region required for homophilic binding was mapped to the Ig domain of PTPÎ¼ (13). In addition	 the Ig domain is required for proper cell surface localization (14). However	 assays that test cell-cell aggregation demonstrate that the MAM and Ig domains as well as the first two fibronectin type III repeats are required for efficient cell-cell aggregation (15â€“ 18). Similarly	 PTPÎº was also demonstrated to mediate homophilic cell-cell aggregation (11). Here we report that PTPRT (PTPÏ)	 like its homologs	 mediates homophilic cell-cell aggregation in Sf9 cells. Most importantly	 the tumor-derived mutations located in the MAM and Ig domains are defective in this cell-cell adhesion function.  Go to: Results The extracellular domain of PTPÏ mediates cell-cell aggregation in Sf9 cells  To test whether PTPÏ mediates homophilic cell-cell adhesion	 we made the following PTPÏ baculoviral constructs expressing: (1) full-length PTPÏ; (2) the intracellular fragment of PTPÏ (Intra); (3) the extracellular fragment of PTPÏ with its transmembrane domain (Extra-TM); (4) the extracellular fragment of PTPÏ with its transmembrane	 juxtamembrane and wedge domains (Extra-JMD-W); (5) a chimera containing the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the EGF receptor and the intracellular PTP domains of PTPÏ (Fig. 1A). All of those fragments were tagged with V5 epitope tags. Proteins of the expected size were expressed in Sf9 cells infected with those baculoviral constructs (Fig. 1B). All of these proteins	 but the intracellular PTPÏ	 were expressed on the surface on Sf9 cells (Fig. 1C). To test whether these PTPÏ recombinant proteins mediate cell-cell adhesion	 a cell aggregation assay was performed following the procedure of Brady-Kalnay et al (9). Sf9 cells infected with a baculovirus encoding PTPÎ¼	 which was previously demonstrated to mediate cell-cell aggregation	 were treated in parallel as a positive control (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig 2	 the non-adhesive Sf9 cells expressing either the full-length PTPÏ or PTPÏ-JMD-W formed cell aggregates. On the contrary	 Sf9 cells expressing either the intracellular fragments of PTPÏ or the EGFR/PTPÏ chimeras remained as a suspension of single cells (Fig 1C). These results indicate that the extracullar fragment of PTPÏ play an important role in mediating cell-cell aggregation and the phosphatase activity of PTPÏ is not required for this function. Surprisingly	 although the construct that encodes the PTPÏ extracellular fragment with the transmembrane domain sequences only (Extra-TM) was expressed on the cell surface (see Figure 7)	 this protein failed to mediate cell aggregation of Sf9 cells	 suggesting that additional juxtamembrane sequences are required for either forming or stablizing the cell aggregates.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Expression of PTPÏ constructs in Sf9 cells Figure 2 Figure 2 PTPÏ mediates cell-cell aggregation Figure 7 Figure 7 Cell Surface Protein expression of PTPÎ¼ and the PTPÏ mutant proteins PTPÏ mediates highly specific homophilic cell-cell aggregation  To test whether PTPÏ mediates homophilic cell-cell aggregation	 one set of Sf9 cells were infected with virus expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and another set of Sf9 cells were co-infected with viruses expressing either the full-length PTPÏ or red fluorescent protein (RFP). The GFP expressing cells were mixed with equal number cells expressing full-length PTPÏ (co-expressing RFP) and the aggregation assays were performed. As shown in Fig 3A	 the GFP labeled cells did not aggregate and did not contribute to the aggregates formed by cells expressing full-length PTPÏ (RFP). These results strongly suggest that the aggregation of Sf9 cells expressing PTPÏ is mediated through a homophilic interaction among PTPÏ molecules in trans	 but not through a heterophilic interaction between molecules expressed on the surface of Sf9 cells. Interestingly	 the homophilic interaction of PTPÏ is very specific. Although 63% of the amino acid sequences of the extracellular domain of PTPÏ are identical with that of PTPRM (PTPÎ¼)	 Sf9 cells expressing PTPÏ (co-expressing RFP) did not aggregate with PTPÎ¼ expressing cells (co-expressing GFP) as shown in Fig. 3B.  Figure 3 Figure 3 PTPÏ mediates homophilic cell-cell aggregation The tumor-derived PTPRT/PTPÏ mutations in the MAM and Ig domains are defective in cell-cell aggregation  Several studies demonstrated that the MAM and Ig domains as well as the first two FNIII repeats of PTPÎ¼ are the minimal essential regions required for its homophilic interaction (13	15	17	 18). We identified 5 tumor-specific mutations that are located in the two domains (2). Among these five mutations	 the F74S mutation is located in the MAM domain and the other four mutations (A209T	 K218T	 F248S and Y280H) are located in the Ig domain (Fig. 4A). To test whether these mutations affect their ability to mediate cell-cell aggregation in Sf9 cells	 we engineered the five mutations by site-directed mutagenesis using the full-length PTPÏ baculoviral construct as the template. The five mutant proteins are expressed at the expected size and at similar levels to wild-type PTPÏ on a western blot (Fig. 4B)	 indicating that these mutations do not affect their protein stability. None of these mutations significantly alter their cell surface expression	 as all five mutant PTPÏ proteins showed strong plasma membrane staining (Fig. 4C and Fig. 7). However	 as shown in Fig. 5	 all mutant PTPÏ proteins formed smaller aggregates than that of the wild-type PTPÏ protein. To quantify the cells aggregates	 percentage of cells that are incorporate into > 5-cell clusters were counted (as described in the material and methods section). As shown in Fig. 5	 Sf9 cells expressing all the mutants formed significantly less aggregates than that of cells expressing wild-type PTPÏ. The deletion construct of PTPÏ lacking the two phosphatase domains (PTPÏ Extra-JMD-W) and the K218T mutant exhibited similar levels of aggregation that were statistically less than wild-type PTPÏ (p < 0.01). Taken together	 our data demonstrated that the five tumor-derived mutations located the MAM and Ig domains of PTPÏ are deficient in cell-cell adhesion. Therefore	 these mutations exhibit varying degrees of loss-of-function in cell adhesion.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Expression of tumor-derived PTPÏ mutants in Sf9 cells Figure 5 Figure 5 Tumor-derived mutations of PTPÏ are defective in cell-cell aggregation Mechanistically	 the defect of the PTPÏ mutations in cell-cell adhesion could be resulted from either impaired ability in homophilic binding or reduced cell surface expression. Although immunofluorescent staining indicated that those mutations do not alter cell surface expression qualitatively	 it is imperative to quantify cell surface expression of mutant PTPÏ proteins. As described in detail in the method section	 baculovirus-infected Sf9 cell surface proteins were labeled with Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin and isolated on immobilized NeutrAvidin Gel. Western blots were performed with antibodies to PTPÎ¼ (SK18) or the V5 tag. The SK18 antibody recognizes the cytoplasmic domain of both PTPÎ¼ and PTPÏ. The results shown in Fig. 7 demonstrate that full length PTPÎ¼ and the wild-type	 mutant and deleted PTPÏ proteins were expressed at the cell surface. As a control for a non-cell surface protein	 the cytoplasmic intracellular domain of PTPÎ¼ (PTPÎ¼-intra) was expressed that is detected by SK18 (9). PTPÎ¼ intra does not contain an extracellular domain and therefore is not biotinylated nor precipitated by the NeutrAvidin gel (Fig. 7). Quantitatively	 the levels of cell surface expression of the 5 tumor-derived PTPÏ mutations were similar to that of wild-type protein. If the cell surface expression level (CSE value) of wild-type PTPÏ is arbitrarily assigned as 1	 the CSE values of F74S	 A209T	 K218T	 F248S and Y280H mutations were 2.3	1.1	1.6	 0.6 and 0.8 respectively. Interestingly	 some PTPÏ mutants that contain the extracellular domain but are unable to mediate cell-cell aggregation are expressed at higher levels on the Sf9 cell surface than wild-type PTPÏ. These results suggest that defect of PTPÏ mutation in cell-cell adhesion is mainly due to reduced homophilic binding affinity of the mutant proteins. Interestingly	 the cell surface expression levels PTPÏ Extra-TM (CSE value = 27) and PTPÏ Extra-JMD-W (CSE value = 20) were much higher than that of full-length protein for unknown reasons.  Go to: Discussion We demonstrated that PTPRT/PTPÏ meditates homophilic cell-cell aggregation and five tumor-derived mutations located in the MAM and Ig domains impair this function. Our results strongly suggest that those PTPÏ loss-of-function mutations are selected for during the process of tumor development; therefore	 these mutations should play a causal role in tumorigenesis. We chose to examine whether the MAM and Ig domain mutations are deficient in cell aggregation	 because previous studies indicated that these two domains of PTPÎ¼	 a close homolog of PTPÏ	 are required for its cell-cell aggregation function (13	15	 17). Recently	 the crystal structure of the N-terminal MAM and Ig domains of PTPÎ¼ was determined at 2.7 Ã… resolution (17	 18). Five tumor-derived mutations of PTPÏ are located in the two domains and all of them can be mapped to equivalent residues in the MAM and Ig domain structure of PTPÎ¼. Based on the crystal structure	 the authors predicted that 4 of them (F74S	 A209T	 F248S and Y280H) would cause significant perturbation of the structure of PTPRT	 because these mutations dramatically alter the character of buried side-chains (17). Moreover	 the fifth mutation K218T is located on the surface of the Ig domain and the authors predicted that this mutation would directly alter protein-protein interactions (17). Our data indicated that the K218T mutation affects the size of aggregates and only a small effect on the percentage of cells incorporated into the aggregates	 suggesting that the K218T mutant may decrease the binding affinity of PTPÏ. Interestingly	 the other four mutations significantly reduce the percentage of aggregation	 therefore	 these data suggest that the F74S	 A209T	 F248S and Y280H mutations dramatically alter the domain structure and lead to perturbation of the homophilic interaction of PTPÏ. Our previous studies showed that the tumor-derived phosphatase domain mutations of PTPÏ diminish its phosphatase activity and overexpression of PTPÏ suppresses the growth of colorectal cancer cells	 indicating that PTPÏ normally act as a tumor suppressor (2). The loss-of-function nature of these five extracellular mutations provides further supportive evidence to this notion.  The finding that PTPÏ mediates homophilic cell aggregation of non-adhesive insect Sf9 cells suggests that this protein could be involved in cell-cell adhesion in human epithelial cells where it is endogenously expressed. The type IIB RPTP subfamily consists of PTPÎ¼	 PTPÎº	 PTPÏ and PCP-2. It has been shown that PTPÎ¼	 PTPÎº and PTPÎ» (PCP-2)	 mediate homophilic cell-cell adhesion (9â€“12). Interestingly	 the homophilic interaction of these RPTPs seems to be highly specific	 because we and others showed that neither PTPÏ nor PTPÎº (15) interact with PTPÎ¼. It is worth noting that the juxtamembrane domain of PTPÏ may be necessary for its cell adhesion function. As shown in Figure 2	 Sf9 cells expressing the extracellular and juxtamembrane domains of PTPÏ	 but not cells expressing the extracellular and transmembrane portion of the protein (PTPÏ Extra-TM)	 formed cell aggregates	 although both proteins were expressed on the cell surface (Fig. 7). Expression of a construct encoding the extracellular	 transmembrane and only 55 amino acids of the juxtamembrane domain of PTPÎ¼ in non-adhesive Sf9 insect cells induced cell aggregation (9). It is possible that cis interactions between the membrane proximal juxtamembrane domains are required for initiating	 stabilizing or maintaining cell-cell adhesion. Interestingly	 there are two PTPRT mutations (K788E and R790I) located in the juxtamembrane domain that are found in lung cancers (1). Moreover	 Besco et al. showed that PTPÏ interacts with cell adhesion molecules including E-cadherin	 Î±	 Î²	 and Î³-catenin	 and Î±;-actinin (19). PTPÎ¼ also binds the cadherin-catenin complex (7	 20â€“22). Loss of cell-cell adhesion	 such as genetic and epigenetic inactivation of cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin	 is thought to be a prerequisite for carcinoma invasion and metastasis (23). Therefore	 mutational inactivation of the cell adhesion function PTPÏ may also play a critical role in tumor migration and metastasis.  																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										
1	59||Most cancers are characterized by increased STAT3 activation where phosphorylated STAT3 levels are associated with reduced survival. The molecular mechanisms underlying aberrant STAT3 phosphorylation/activation in human malignancies have been elusive. Our findings provide a mechanistic basis for tumor-specific STAT3 hyperactivation in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). We demonstrate that receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatases	 encoded by PTPR genes	 including PTPRT	 are commonly mutated in HNSCC where PTPR mutations are associated with increased phosphorylation of STAT3 in tumors. Several cancer-related PTPRT mutations localize to the substrate interaction surface of the enzyme catalytic domains. Expression of mutated PTPRT in HNSCC models markedly increases STAT3 activation	 promoting cellular survival. PTPRT mutations may therefore serve as predictive biomarkers for STAT3 pathway inhibitors	 suggesting new therapeutic opportunities.  Keywords: STAT3 activation	 driver mutations	 phosphatase mutations Go to: ABSTRACT The underpinnings of STAT3 hyperphosphorylation resulting in enhanced signaling and cancer progression are incompletely understood. Loss-of-function mutations of enzymes that dephosphorylate STAT3	 such as receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases	 which are encoded by the PTPR gene family	 represent a plausible mechanism of STAT3 hyperactivation. We analyzed whole exome sequencing (n = 374) and reverse-phase protein array data (n = 212) from head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). PTPR mutations are most common and are associated with significantly increased phospho-STAT3 expression in HNSCC tumors. Expression of receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase T (PTPRT) mutant proteins induces STAT3 phosphorylation and cell survival	 consistent with a â€œdriverâ€ phenotype. Computational modeling reveals functional consequences of PTPRT mutations on phospho-tyrosineâ€“substrate interactions. A high mutation rate (30%) of PTPRs was found in HNSCC and 14 other solid tumors	 suggesting that PTPR alterations	 in particular PTPRT mutations	 may define a subset of patients where STAT3 pathway inhibitors hold particular promise as effective therapeutic agents.  Tyrosine phosphorylation regulates a multitude of cellular processes by coordinately activating and inactivating signaling proteins. Aberrations of protein tyrosine phosphorylation and signaling are a hallmark for oncogenic events found in most human cancers. The phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of tyrosine residues on signaling proteins is directly mediated by protein tyrosine kinases and phosphatases. Although many cellular factors are known to dynamically control the activity of these enzymes	 genetic alterations of kinases and phosphatases in human cancers lead to perturbations in the levels of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins	 uncontrolled cell growth	 and tumor formation. Although activating mutations of tyrosine kinases have been extensively studied (1	 2)	 cancer-associated mutations of tyrosine phosphatases remain incompletely understood	 partly due to the lack of comprehensive genomic analysis of these large arrays of phosphatases	 as well as their largely unknown and often ambiguous actions in normal physiology and cancer biology.  Among the 107 known protein tyrosine phosphatases	 the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) represent the largest family of the human tyrosine phosphatome	 comprising 21 family members (3). These RPTPs are believed to be crucial for the regulation of inter- as well as intracellular signaling due to the cell-surface localization of RPTPs. Selected members of the RPTP family have been reported to function as tumor suppressors	 where gene mutation	 deletion	 or methylation may contribute to the cancer phenotype (3).  STAT3 is an oncogene	 and constitutive STAT3 activation is a hallmark of human cancers. Activating STAT3 mutations are rare in all cancers studied to date	 including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) (4). Although activating mutations of upstream receptor tyrosine kinases leading to increased STAT3 phosphorylation characterize some malignancies [e.g.	 EGFR mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (5)]	 most cancers lack these alterations yet harbor elevated phospho-STAT3 (p-STAT3) levels. We (Z.W.) previously reported that STAT3 serves as a substrate for wild-type PTPRT enzyme (also known as RPTP-T	 RPTPÏ	 or RPTPrho) in colorectal cancer cells (SW480 and HT29) and HEK293T cells (6). STAT3 has additionally been reported to be a substrate of PTPRD (also known as PTPÎ´) in glioblastoma models	 suggesting that several RPTP family members may exhibit tumor-suppressive function by dephosphorylating STAT3 (7). In the present study	 we hypothesized that mutation of RPTP family members	 including PTPRT	 results in elevated expression levels of tyrosine phosphorylated STAT3 in human HNSCC. Analysis of reverse-phase protein array and sequencing data demonstrated significant association between PTPR mutation and increased p-STAT3 expression levels in HNSCC	 establishing the de novo signaling consequence of PTPR mutations on a major oncogenic pathway that drives human carcinogenesis. Studies in HNSCC models demonstrate that PTPRT mutations induce p-STAT3 and HNSCC survival	 consistent with a â€œdriverâ€ phenotype whereas computational modeling revealed functional implications of PTPR mutations on phospho-tyrosine (p-Tyr)â€“substrate interactions. Analysis of whole-exome sequencing results of 374 primary head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) revealed that PTPR genes are mutated in nearly one-third (30.7%) of HNSCC tumors	 compared with a 15.2% mutation rate in the cytoplasmic protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family. This pattern is strikingly consistent across an additional 14 types of solid tumors sequenced to date	 implicating a potentially important pathologic contribution of PTPR mutations to human carcinogenesis. These cumulative findings suggest that genetic alterations of selected PTPRs	 including PTPRT	 may induce STAT3 activation and serve as predictive biomarkers for treatment with emerging STAT3 pathway inhibitors.  Go to: RESULTS PTPR Mutations Significantly Correlate with in Situ p-STAT3(Y705) Up-Regulation in HNSCC Patient Tumors. To date	 associations between PTPR alterations and human cancers have relied on cell-line models. It remains undetermined whether tumor-specific mutations of these key tyrosine phosphatases mediate STAT3 hyperactivation in human tumors	 including HNSCC. Using reverse phase protein array (RPPA)	 we conducted an integrative proteomic-genomic analysis on HNSCC patient tumors. We sought to determine whether PTPR mutation is correlated with altered STAT3(Y705) phosphorylation in primary HNSCC tumor specimens. Strikingly	 examination of 212 HNSCC primary tumors showed that tumors harboring mutations in PTPR tumor suppressor genes (including PTPRD/J/K/M/O/S/T) (3) expressed significantly higher levels of p-STAT3(Y705) compared with tumors with wild-type PTPR family members (P = 0.02) (Fig. 1A). These results provide evidence of a direct association between PTPR mutation and elevated STAT3 phosphorylation/activation in human tumors in situ and establish a plausible mechanism for STAT3 hyperactivation in human cancers. In contrast	 we observed no correlation between p-STAT3(Y705) expression and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)	 p-EGFR(Y1068)	 p-EGFR(Y1173)	 suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)	 Src	 or interleukin 6 (IL6) expression. Additionally	 HNSCC tumors harboring multiple PTPR mutations exhibited an even greater increase in p-STAT3(Y705) expression although the number of tumors in these groups is insufficient for statistical analysis (n = 14	2	1	 or 1	 for tumors with 2	3	4	 or 5 PTPR mutations per tumor	 respectively). Upregulation of p-STAT3(Y705) was further confirmed by immunohistochemistry in HNSCC tumors harboring PTPR mutations (Fig. S1) and in HNSCC cell lines harboring endogenous PTPR mutations (Fig. S2).  Fig. 1. Fig. 1. PTPR mutations correlate with STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation in HNSCC tumors and enhance survival and STAT3 phosphorylation in HNSCC cells. (A) Significant increase in p-STAT3(Y705) expression (intensity plot in log2 scale; protein array data from The ... PTPRT Mutations â€œDriveâ€ HNSCC Cell Survival and STAT3 Activation. The biologic/functional consequences of tumor-derived PTPR mutations in HNSCC are unknown. To determine whether HNSCC PTPRT mutations act as â€œdrivers	â€ we developed a serum-dependent HNSCC cell line (PCI-52-SD1) that undergoes rapid cell death in the absence of serum. Using this model	 stable expression of two representative mutants (calculated to result in both charge and amino acid size changes) (Table S1)	 PTPRT(A1022E) and PTPRT(R1040L)	 conferred increased survival (3.2- and 6.2-fold	 respectively) compared with expression of empty vector control	 confirming a driver phenotype for these PTPRT mutants in HNSCC cells (Fig. 1B).  To investigate the mechanism responsible for the driver phenotype of the PTPRT mutants	 we tested the hypothesis that PTPRT mutations identified in HNSCC may impair the phosphatase activity of the enzyme	 resulting in increased phosphorylation of PTPRT substrates	 including the oncogenic transcription factor STAT3. Stable expression of wild-type PTPRT in PCI-52-SD1 cells resulted in reduction of basal p-STAT3 levels by âˆ¼48% (P = 0.0014) (Fig. 1C)	 demonstrating that wild-type PTPRT can modulate STAT3 activation in HNSCC cells. On the other hand	 expression of a PTPRT protein harboring a mutation (A1022E) in the catalytic domain promoted up-regulation of the p-STAT3 protein in an HNSCC cell line with low basal levels of p-STAT3 (CAL-33) (Fig. 1D). Similar effects were observed in HEK293 cells upon transient expression of a PTPRT mutant (Fig. S3). Interestingly	 expression of a PTPRT protein with a mutation (P497T) in the extracellular fibronectin type III-like domain did not alter the phosphorylation status of STAT3 (Fig. 1D)	 suggesting that mutations outside the catalytic domains may have other mechanisms of action. In addition	 expression of wild-type PTPRT in EGFR-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts resulted in decreased expression of p-STAT3(Y705)	 suggesting that PTPRT catalytic activity is independent of EGFR expression/activity (Fig. S4).  Computational Modeling of PTPRT Mutations in the Substrate Binding Sites Reveals Plausible Functional Alterations of Phosphatase Activity. Given that a high percentage of PTPRT mutations are located within the enzymatic (PTPase) domain	 we sought to determine the potential impact of these mutations on interactions between the catalytic domains and phospho-tyrosine substrate using a molecular modeling approach. Although the structure of a PTPRTâ€“p-Tyr protein complex is not available	 the X-ray crystallographic structure of the PTPRT phosphatase domain alone has been reported (PDB ID code 2OOQ) (8). Therefore	 we determined by homology modeling (9)	 the approximate substrate-interacting surface of the PTPRT PTPase domains 1 and 2 (Fig. 2 Aâ€“D) based on the highly similar (to PTPRT) crystal structure of human tyrosine phosphatase PTPN5 in complex with p-Tyr (detailed in Materials and Methods). Using this model	 we localized several cancer-related PTPRT mutation sites to the substrate-interaction surface of the PTPRT PTPase domains 1 and 2 in close proximity to incorporated p-Tyr (D905	 R928	 H1053	 G1089	 and V1124 in domain 1; Q1180	 R1201	 R1207	 P1213	 Q1286	 T1346	 N1380	 G1382	 and R1384 in domain 2). Mutation sites previously shown to decrease the PTPRT phosphatase activity were also found in proximity to p-Tyr regions (C1084	 D1052	 Y893	 Q965	 R1188	 and T1346) (10	 11). These results suggest that PTPRT PTPase domain mutations	 which are found in human cancers	 likely interfere with enzymatic activity and/or substrate interactions. Of note	 in addition to the reported missense mutations of the PTPRT PTPase domains	 many nonsense mutations (mutation to a stop codon) and frameshift mutations are highly likely to alter PTPRT structure and stability	 as well as impacting substrate interactions (L362fs	 R617fs	 Q434*	 and Q615* found in HNSCC	 and E1227*	 R1207*	 E1155*	 R1358*	 and G1386* in other cancers; COSMIC database).

PTPR Genes Are Mutated in Nearly One-Third of HNSCC Tumors	 and PTPRT Is the Most Frequently Mutated PTPR. PTPRT belongs to the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase family	 which comprises 21 members	 and no genomic study to date has examined the mutational profile of the entire family in a large number of human tumor specimens. To understand the potential genetic contributions of the PTPR family (in addition to PTPRT) to tyrosine signaling/regulation in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)	 we comprehensively analyzed PTPR family mutations in large cohorts of primary HNSCC tumors. Whole-exome sequencing data of 374 primary HNSCCs were included [from 300 TCGA HNSCC tumors and 74 HNSCCs previously published (12)]. Strikingly	 30.7% (115/374) of HNSCC tumors harbored nonsynonymous somatic mutations of at least one PTPR family member	 compared with only 15.2% (57/374) of tumors with mutations of cytoplasmic PTP genes	 the second major family of PTPs (Fig. 3A). Further	 7.8% (29/374) of HNSCC tumors contained multiple mutations of PTPR family members (from two to six PTPR mutations/tumor) (Fig. 3B) (Table S2 contains all PTPR mutations found in HNSCC). Further investigation demonstrated that this high rate of somatic mutation of the PTPR family (vs. cytoplasmic PTPs) found in HNSCC is also detected in all 14 types of human solid tumors sequenced to date by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (4	039 total solid tumors sequenced)	 but not in a hematopoietic malignancy (6/196 AML cases; 3.1%) (Fig. 3C and Table S3)	 implicating a likely pathologic involvement of PTPR mutations in HNSCC	 as well as other solid human tumors.  Fig. 3. Fig. 3. Whole-exome sequencing of human cancers demonstrates high rates of PTPR somatic mutations. (A) Frequencies of PTPR (the receptor subtype) and cytoplasmic PTP somatic mutations in 374 HNSCC tumors. (B) A subset (29/374	 7.8%) of HNSCC tumors harbor mutations ... Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is a known etiologic factor in a subset of HNSCC and is capable of disrupting genome stability. Thus	 we examined whether HPV was associated with the high rate of PTPR mutations in HNSCC. Statistical analysis showed no correlation between PTPR mutation and HPV status (P = 0.31; PTPR mutations in 11/48 HPV-positive tumors vs. 93/299 HPV-negative tumors)	 indicating that HPV is not a contributing factor to PTPR mutations in HNSCC. Further analysis showed that PTPR mutations were not associated with mutations of TP53 (P = 0.81)	 NOTCH1 (P = 0.24)	 PIK3CA (P = 0.47)	 or HRAS (P = 0.77) in HNSCC	 indicating that PTPR mutations are independent of these known common mutational events in HNSCC tumors (12).  The availability of comprehensive whole-exome sequencing data (from TCGA) on all PTPR genes allowed us to identify the most commonly mutated PTPRs in all sequenced human cancers	 including HNSCC. Among the 374 sequenced HNSCC tumors	 PTPRT is the most frequently mutated PTPR (5.6% cases; 22 mutations total	 with one tumor harboring 2 PTPRT mutations)	 followed by PTPRC	 PTPRD	 and PTPRM (Table S2). Although PTPR mutation rates vary among different cancer types	 cumulative results reveal that PTPRT is the single most commonly mutated PTPR in human cancers (6.2%	 285 mutations in 4	609 solid and hematopoietic cancers sequenced) (Table S3)	 with the highest mutation frequency of PTPRT in cutaneous melanoma (a total of 99 mutations in 253 tumors sequenced; 39.1%).  The sites of the most frequently mutated PTPR members (PTPRT/C/D/M) in HNSCC are shown in Fig. 3D (all other HNSCC-associated PTPR mutations are shown in Fig. S5). Cumulative mutation data for PTPRT in 16 types of sequenced tumors indicate that 37.9% (108/285) of PTPRT mutations are found in the catalytic phosphatase (PTPase) domain whereas 33.0% (94/285) occur in the extracellular fibronectin type III-like (FN3) domain. In HNSCC	 45.5% (10/22) of PTPRT mutations are located in the PTPase domain (Fig. 3D)	 indicating the pathologic relevance of these genetic alterations of the phosphatase activity	 which lead to pSTAT3 up-regulation in HNSCC tumors.  Go to: DISCUSSION These cumulative results indicate that selected tumor-associated PTPRT mutations can alter STAT3 phosphorylation/activation. Our findings suggest a previously undescribed	 and potentially common	 mechanism for dysregulated cell survival and growth involving PTPR mutation and STAT3 hyperactivation. Therefore	 tumors that harbor PTPR (including PTPRT) mutations may be amenable to treatment with STAT3 pathway inhibitors. The frequency of PTPR mutations is unexpectedly high across all solid tumor types analyzed to date. The dispersed distribution and lack of hotspot mutations in PTPR genes suggest that these mutations likely represent loss-of-function events affecting tumor suppressive proteins rather than gain-of-function of oncogenic proteins in cancer. Although this mutation pattern is consistent with that reported for select PTPRs in colorectal cancers (10)	 this study represents a comprehensive analysis of somatic mutations of the entire PTPR family across all human cancers sequenced to date.  Constitutive STAT3 activation is frequently found in nearly all human cancers	 and expression levels of p-STAT3(Y705) are often associated with poor prognosis (13â€“15). Mechanisms driving STAT3 activation in cancer are incompletely understood. Direct sequencing of thousands of patient tumors by TCGA has not identified common or consistent STAT3 mutational events in solid tumors. Furthermore	 solid tumors	 including HNSCC	 exhibit a lack of activating mutations in kinases upstream of STAT3 (4). Thus	 activating mutations of STAT3	 or of direct upstream positive regulators	 are unlikely to be the key genetic factors driving STAT3 hyperactivation in human cancers. PTPRT has been reported to be a negative regulator of STAT3 (6). Our integrative genomic-proteomic findings establish that PTPRT mutations are important genetic events that drive in situ up-regulation of p-STAT3(Y705) within patient tumors. This reveals the driver role of genetic mutations in a negative regulator(s) of STAT3	 an important oncogenic signaling protein in human cancer. PTPRT has been previously shown to be a tumor suppressor (in colon cancer cell line models)	 consistent with our present findings (16). Our results suggest that loss-of-function mutations in tumor suppressor tyrosine phosphatases may not only serve as permissive factors for oncogenesis as previously demonstrated	 but can also act as direct drivers for cancer cell growth via dysregulation of substrate tyrosine phosphorylation.  Studies of PTPRT	 in particular	 showed that PTPRT has a discretely defined set of substrates	 including STAT3 and paxillin. In our current study	 the correlation between paxillin phosphorylation and PTPRT mutations was not examined	 as antiâ€“phospho-paxillin antibody has not been validated for our protein array platform. However	 it is possible that paxillin signaling may also be affected by PTPRT mutations in the human tumors.  Computational modeling allows us to predict the potential effects of PTPase domain mutations (located intracellularly) in PTPRT	 which may be applicable to other RPTP proteins. However	 there are no existing computational methodologies to reliably predict the effects of the extracellular domain mutations (such as the FN3 domain mutations) found in these proteins. The broad existence of these extracellular domain mutations in the RPTP family will require systematic functional validation of each mutation in relevant cell models	 as we have previously shown that some of these mutations could alter cellâ€“cell adhesion	 and thereby promote tumor cell migration (17).  The present study demonstrates that wild-type PTPRT promotes down-regulation of p-STAT3(Y705) in HNSCC and that somatic PTPRT mutations may represent â€œdrivingâ€ events in cancer. We identify that somatic PTPR mutations	 including PTPRT mutations	 are associated with elevated p-STAT3(Y705) in human HNSCC. Other RPTP family members	 especially PTPRD	 may play similar roles in HNSCC and other solid tumors	 where somatic mutation may lead to loss-of-function and subsequent activation of oncogenic pathways. Indeed	 several commonly mutated PTPRs have been implicated as tumor suppressors	 including PTPRD (18)	 PTPRF (10)	 PTPRG (10	 19)	 PTPRJ (20)	 and PTPRS (21).  In conclusion	 PTPR mutational events are relatively common in primary HNSCC	 as well as in many other solid tumors as revealed by large-scale whole-exome sequencing studies. We demonstrate that tumor-specific mutational events in the PTPRT gene can serve as direct drivers for tumor growth by inducing hyperactivation of STAT3	 a potent oncogenic transcription factor and PTPRT substrate. STAT3 pathway inhibitors are under active investigation in human cancers and include transcription factor decoys	 disruptors of recruitment of STAT3 to the IL6/IL6Ralpha/gp130 complex	 and upstream kinase inhibitors	 primarily Janus kinase inhibitors (22	 23). It is biologically plausible that selected PTPR mutations may identify tumors that may be particularly responsive to treatment with STAT3 pathway inhibitors.  																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	
1	60||The receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase T (PTPRT/PTPÏ) is the most frequently mutated tyrosine phosphatase in human cancer. PTPÏ mediates homophilic cell-cell aggregation. In its extracellular region	 PTPÏ has cell adhesion molecule-like motifs	 including a MAM domain	 an immunoglobulin domain and four fibronectin type III (FNIII) repeats. Tumor-derived mutations have been identified in all of these extracellular domains. Previously	 we determined that tumor-derived mutations in the MAM and immunoglobulin domains of PTPÏ reduce homophilic cell-cell aggregation. In this manuscript	 we describe experiments in which we evaluated the contribution of the FNIII repeats to PTPÏ-mediated cell-cell adhesion. Our results demonstrate that deletion of the FNIII repeats of PTPÏ result in defective cell-cell aggregation. Furthermore	 all of the tumor-derived mutations in the FNIII repeats of PTPÏ also disrupt cell-cell aggregation. These results further support the hypothesis that mutational inactivation of PTPÏ may lead to cancer progression by disrupting cell-cell adhesion.  Keywords: Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase	 PTPRT	 PTPÏ	 fibronectin type III repeat	 cell-cell aggregation	 cell-cell adhesion Go to: 1. Introduction Cancer progression and metastasis is in part influenced by changes in cell adhesion and tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) (Paschos et al. 2009; Wheelock et al. 2008)	 as well as tyrosine kinases and tyrosine phosphatases	 respectively (Freiss and Vignon 2004; Ostman et al. 2006). Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) comprise a family of proteins that have extracellular CAM domains coupled to cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatase domains	 and thus can impact cancer progression by regulating both cell adhesion and tyrosine phosphorylation (Brady-Kalnay 2001; Ostman et al. 2006).  The type IIB PTPÎ¼-like subfamily of RPTPs includes PTPÎ¼	 PTPÏ	 PTPÎº	 and PCP-2 (PTPÎ») (Aricescu et al. 2008; Brady-Kalnay 2001). The extracellular segment of the PTPÎ¼-like RPTPs contain motifs found in CAMs	 including a MAM domain	 an immunoglobulin (Ig) domain and four fibronectin type III (FNIII) repeats (Aricescu et al. 2008; Brady-Kalnay 2001; Ostman et al. 2006). PTPÎ¼ subfamily members bind homophilically (i.e. the â€œligandâ€ for PTPÎ¼ is an identical PTPÎ¼ molecule on an adjacent cell) (Brady-Kalnay et al. 1993; Cheng et al. 1997; Gebbink et al. 1993; Sap et al. 1994; Yu et al. 2008; Zondag et al. 1995). The Ig domain of PTPÎ¼ is responsible for promoting homophilic interactions (Brady-Kalnay and Tonks 1994)	 and proper cell surface localization (Del Vecchio and Tonks 2005). However	 both the MAM and Ig domains as well as the first two FNIII repeats are required for efficient cell-cell adhesion of PTPÎ¼ (Aricescu et al. 2006; Aricescu et al. 2007; Aricescu et al. 2008; Brady-Kalnay and Tonks 1994; Cismasiu et al. 2004; Zondag et al. 1995). PTPÏ and PTPÎº also mediate homophilic cell-cell adhesion (Sap et al. 1994; Yu et al. 2008). However	 PCP2 has not yet been demonstrated to mediate cell-cell adhesion or aggregation although in vitro binding studies indicate it can bind homophilically (Cheng et al. 1997).  All type IIB RPTPs are potential tumor suppressor genes (Burgoyne et al. 2009a; Flavell et al. 2008; McArdle et al. 2001; Yan et al. 2006). Notably	 PTPÏ is the most frequently mutated phosphatase gene in human cancers including colon	 lung	 skin and stomach cancers (Forbes et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2004). Defective adhesion mediated by PTPÏ may be at least one mechanism of cancer progression. In fact	 cancer derived mutations in the MAM and Ig domains of PTPÏ are defective in mediating cell-cell aggregation (Yu et al. 2008).  In addition to the tumor-derived mutations in the MAM and Ig domains of PTPÏ previously described (Wang et al. 2004; Yu et al. 2008)	 the majority of extracellular domain mutations are located in the FNIII repeats of PTPÏ (Wang et al. 2004). Given the importance of FNIII repeats in PTPÎ¼-mediated adhesion and aggregation (Aricescu et al. 2007)	 we tested the contribution of the FNIII repeats of PTPÏ to PTPÏ-mediated adhesion. We determined that deletion constructs where each of the extracellular domains of PTPÏ is removed	 including the FNIII repeats	 are defective in mediating cell-cell aggregation of Sf9 cells. Furthermore	 when we engineered the cancer-derived mutations in the FNIII repeats of these PTPÏ mutant proteins	 they also result in defective cell-cell aggregation. These results demonstrate the importance of the FNIII repeats in contributing to proper cell-cell adhesion and suggest that adhesion mediated by PTPÏ is likely important for the tumor suppressor activity of PTPÏ.

The medium was supplemented with 10% FBS from (Hyclone	 Logan	 UT) and Gentamicin (MP Biomedicals	 Solon	 OH). Viruses were added to Sf9 cell medium to induce the expression of proteins of interest.

The primers 5â€™-GAAGATCTATGGCGAGCCTCGCCGCG-3â€™ and 5â€™-CCGGAATTCGGATCCTGGGGCGCTCTGAGCCCGGG-3â€™ were used to generate the PTPÏ-Î”MAM construct; the primers 5â€™-GCGTGGGAGGCTCTCTGCATGGATGAGCAAGGAC-3â€™ and 5â€™-CAATGGGTCTTGCTCATCCATGCAGAGAGCCTCCCACGCCCATTG-3â€™ were used to generate the PTPÏ-Î”Ig construct; the primers 5â€™-CTGCACACTTGGTCCTGGTTTTCACGATCAGCTCCGCGTA-3â€™ and 5â€™-TACGCGGAGCGTCGTGAAAACCAGGACCAAGTGTGCAG-3â€™ were used to generate the PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-1 construct; the primers 5â€™-CCGCCAGGGCCTCCCCTCACCGAGGAAGACGTTCCAGGAG-3â€™ and 5â€™-CTCCTGGAACGTCTTCCTCGGTGAGGGGAGGCCCTGGCGG-3â€™ were used to generate the PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-2 construct; the primers 5â€™-GAGGAGCTGGTGGTGCAGACTAAAATTTCAGCTCCATCCA-3â€™ and 5â€™-TGGATGGAGCTGAAATTTTAGTCTGCACCACCAGCTCCTC-3â€™ were used to generate the PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-3 construct and the 5â€™-GTCACCACTCGGATTGCCACCGGTGCCTCCACCCAGAATT-3â€™ and 5â€™-AATTCTGGGTGGAGGCACCGGTGGCAATCCGAGTGGTGAC-3â€™ were used to generate the PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-4 construct.  2.4 Immunoblotting  Sf9 cells were lysed in a standard lysis buffer (20 mM TrisÂ·HCl	 pH 7.5	 1% Triton X-100	 150 mM sodium chloride	 2 mM Benzamidine	 2.5Î¼g/ml Aprotinin	 2.5Î¼g/ml Leupeptin	 and 0.5Î¼g/ml Pepstatin). Samples were solubilized in 2X SDS loading buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Samples were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman	 Piscataway	 NJ) and immunoblotted with SK18 (Brady-Kalnay et al. 1993)	 which cross-reacts with PTPÏ.  2.5 Cell surface expression of PTPÏ  Cell surface expression of PTPÏ protein in baculovirus infected Sf9 cells was determined using a modified biotin-avidin reaction with the Cell Surface Protein Isolation Kit (catalog# 89991	 Pierce	 Rockford	 IL)	 as previously described (Yu et al. 2008). Briefly	 Sf9 cell media was removed and the flasks were incubated with rocking for 30 minutes at 4Â°C in 5ml of 0.25mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin in 1X PBS. The cells were mechanically removed from the flask	 centrifuged	 washed	 and lysed according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocols. To isolate cell surface expressed PTPÏ the cell lysate was added to a NeutrAvidin Gel column and incubated for 60 min at room temperature (RT) with rocking prior to washing and eluting proteins with 200Î¼l of sample buffer containing a final concentration of 55mM DTT for 60min at RT. The flow through was run on 6% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Total cell surface protein levels were normalized by immunoblotting cell lysates with an anti-actin antibody (JLA20). The normalized cell surface protein was run on 6% SDS-PAGE gels	 transferred to nitrocellulose and immunoblotted with antibodies to PTPÎ¼ that also recognized PTPÏ (SK18) followed by secondary antibody conjugated to HRP. The HRP signal was detected using a Fluor-S MAX MultiImager (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.	 Hercules	 CA).  2.6 Aggregation Assays  Sf9 cells were harvested by trituration. The cell suspensions were added to glass scintillation vials and incubated at 27Â°C at 90 rpm in a gyratory shaker for 30 minutes. For a given condition	 the cell suspension was transferred to a 100mm petri dish either prior to (0 time point) or 30 minutes after aggregation. Images were captured at 10X magnification with a Nikon TE-200 inverted fluorescent microscope (Tokyo	 Japan). To quantify cell aggregates	 pictures of four randomly selected fields were taken per dish. The area of each object (single cells and aggregates) was determined by the Metamorph software (Molecular Devices) using an auto-threshold setting for light objects and appropriate size filters that allowed the counting of cells and aggregates but not debris. The four replicates were combined to yield average readings per condition. The percent aggregation was then calculated as the average aggregate area at 30 minutes minus the average aggregate area at zero minutes divided by the average aggregate area at 30 minutes [(N30-N0)/N30]. A minimum of three independent experiments was performed per condition. Statistical significance was determined in Microsoft Excel using Studentâ€™s T-test. Error bars indicate standard error.  2.7 Site-directed mutagenesis  The I395V	 Y412F	 R453C	 Q479E	 S492F	 N510K	 T605M	 V648G	 A707T	 and L708P tumor-derived mutations (Wang et al. 2004) were generated by fusion PCR using the full-length PTPRT pVL1393-V5-His vector as the template. The primers 5â€™-TGGCCCACAGAACGTGGAAGTCGTAGACATCAGAGCC-3â€™ and 5â€™-CTTCCACGTTCTGTGGGCCA-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the I395V mutant; the primers 5â€™-CAGTGGGAGCCCTTCGGCTTCGCGGTGACCCGCTGCCAT-3â€™ and 5â€™-AAGCCGAAGGGCTCCCACTG-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the Y412F mutant; the primers 5â€™-CTACACCCTGCGAGGCCTGTGCCCCTTCATGACCATCCG-3â€™ and 5â€™-ACAGGCCTCGCAGGGTGTAG-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the R453C mutant; the primers 5â€™-GAGCGAGGAGCTGGTGGTGGAGACTGAGGAAGACGTTCC-3â€™ and 5â€™-CCACCACCAGCTCCTCGCTC-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the Q479E mutant; the primers 5â€™-TGTTCCTCTAGAATTCATCCAAGGGGGGCCCT TT-3â€™ and 5â€™-ATGAATTCTAGAGGAACA-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the S492F mutant; the primers 5â€™-TCCAGTGGAAACCTCCCAAGGAGACCAATGGGGTCATCA-3â€™ and 5â€™-CTTGGGAGGTTTCCACTGGA-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the N510K mutant; the primers 5â€™-CCATTGAATGAGACAGACATGACC ATCACAGTGATGCTG3-â€™ and 5â€™-ATGTCTGTCTCATTCAATGG-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the T605M mutant; the primers 5â€™-ATTATTGAGTGCTTTTC GGGGCCCGTGAGCTATCGGAAT-3â€™ and 5â€™-CCCGAAAAGCACTCAATAAT-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the V648G mutant; the primers 5â€™-CTACAGCATCTACTTCCAGACACTCAGCAAAGCCAATGG-3â€™ and 5â€™-TCTGGAAGTAGATGCTGTAG-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the A707T mutant; the primers 5â€™-AGCATCTACTTCCAGGCACCCAGCAAAGCCAATGGAGAG-3â€™ and 5â€™-GGTGCCTGGAAGTAGATGCT-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the L708P mutant.  2.8 Mapping of PTPÏ mutations onto the PTPÎ¼ crystal structure  The sequence of PTPÎ¼ and PTPÏ were aligned using CLUSTALW. Mutations probed in this study were mapped using this sequence alignment onto the PTPÎ¼ structure (PDB ID: 2V5Y). The figure was prepared utilizing PyMOL 1.2r1 (http://pymol.org).  Go to: 3. Results 3.1 Deletions in the MAM	 Ig	 and FNIII repeat domains of PTPÏ result in defective cell-cell aggregation  To test whether a protein mediates cell-cell aggregation or adhesion	 one has to express the protein of interest in the non-adhesive cells. Otherwise	 one cannot measure the aggregation or adhesion of a single molecule in the sea of other adhesion molecules naturally expressed in adhesive cells. This is the main reason that the non-adhesive Sf9 or Drosophila S2 cells are widely used models for such studies. To our knowledge	 nearly all cell lines of epithelial origin are adhesive cells and thus are not suitable for these studies. Introduction of putative adhesion molecules into non-adhesive Drosophila S2 insect cells has been used to demonstrate adhesive functions for fasciclin II	 connectin	 Dtrk	 ARK	 Neuroglian	 and Capricious molecules directly (Bellosta et al. 1995; Hortsch et al. 1995; Nose et al. 1992; Pulido et al. 1992; Shinza-Kameda et al. 2006; Snow et al. 1989). In a similar approach	 we and others demonstrated that the full-length form of PTPÎ¼ induced aggregation	 via a homophilic binding mechanism	 when expressed in nonadhesive Sf9 insect cells	 which are derived from the Fall army-worm Spodoptera frugiperda (Brady-Kalnay et al. 1993; Gebbink et al. 1993; Zondag et al. 1995). We have also used this system for analyzing PTPRT/PTP rho (Yu et al.	 2008). Examples of other cell adhesion molecules that have been studied in Sf9 cells include L1 (Gouveia et al. 2008)	 Galectin-3 (Inohara and Raz 1995) and C-CAM1 (Phan et al. 2001). Insect S2 and Sf9 cells are extremely useful systems to analyze adhesive mechanisms of cell adhesion molecules.  The MAM domain	 Ig domain	 and first two-FNIII repeats are essential for PTPÎ¼ cell-cell aggregation (Brady-Kalnay and Tonks 1994; Zondag et al. 1995). To test whether these domains are the minimal essential regions required for PTPÏ cell-cell aggregation	 baculoviral PTPÏ deletion constructs of the MAM domain	 Ig domain	 and each of the four individual FNIII repeats were made and expressed in non-adhesive Sf9 insect cells (Figure 1). All the PTPÏ deletion constructs were expressed and appropriately trafficked to the cell surface (Figure 1). To test whether these domains contribute to PTPÏ-dependent adhesion	 Sf9 cells were evaluated for their ability to mediate cell-cell aggregation when expressing the deletion constructs. Aggregation assays with Sf9 cells expressing the deletion constructs were conducted alongside aggregation assays using Sf9 cells expressing wild-type PTPÏ	 which mediates cell-cell aggregation (Figure 2) and serves as a positive control (Yu et al. 2008). Deletion of any of the extracellular domains of PTPÏ resulted in defective cell-cell aggregation compared to aggregation of wild-type PTPÏ expressing Sf9 cells (Figure 2). Deletion of the fourth FNIII repeat was the least severe where ~23% aggregation was observed. Deletion of the MAM domain	 Ig domain and FNIII repeats 1	 2 or 3 resulted in 5â€“16% aggregation. When the level of aggregation was quantified	 we determined that all of the deletion constructs resulted in a large and statistically significant reduction in cell-cell aggregation (Figure 2	 p-value<0.005). Together with our previous study	 these results demonstrate that all of the extracellular domains of PTPÏ are necessary for PTPÏ-mediated cell-cell aggregation.  Figure 1 Figure 1 PTPÏ deletion constructs are all expressed at the cell surface. Constructs containing deletions of one extracellular domain of PTPÏ each were generated and expressed in Sf9 cells. Total cellular protein and cell surface protein were isolated ... Figure 2 Figure 2 Deletion of any of the extracellular domains of PTPÏ disrupts cell-cell aggregation. Sf9 cells expressing deletion constructs of the individual extracellular domains of PTPÏ were allowed to aggregate for 30 minutes prior to imaging. Scale ... 3.2 Tumor-Derived PTPÏ Mutations in the FNIII repeats result in defective cell-cell aggregation  We next tested the effects of human tumor-derived mutations in the FNIII repeats of PTPÏ on PTPÏ-mediated cell-cell aggregation. We recently demonstrated that tumor-derived mutations in the MAM and Ig domains of PTPÏ are defective in cell-cell aggregation using the Sf9 aggregation assay (Yu et al. 2008)	 and given the above results	 we hypothesized that mutations in the FNIII domains would likewise result in defective aggregation. Ten human tumor-derived mutations are located in the second	 third and fourth FNIII repeats of PTPÏ (Wang et al. 2004). To test whether these mutations also affect cell-cell aggregation	 we engineered the ten human mutations by site-directed mutagenesis using the full-length PTPÏ baculoviral construct as a template (see Figure 3). The ten mutations are expressed in Sf9 cells at the expected molecular weight and at similar levels to full-length human PTPÏ (Figure 3). All of these mutants are expressed at the cell surface (Figure 3). When these mutant PTPÏ proteins were expressed in Sf9 cells and tested in aggregation assays	 we observed that all of the mutant PTPÏ proteins resulted in fewer and smaller aggregates than wild type PTPÏ (Figure 4). When the level of aggregation was quantified	 we determined that all of the FNIII mutations significantly reduced cell-cell aggregation (16â€“43%) compared to cells expressing wild type PTPÏ (68% aggregation	 p-value<0.008	 Figure 4).  Figure 3 Figure 3 PTPÏ proteins containing tumor-derived mutations in their FNIII domains are expressed at the cell surface. Ten mutations in the FNIII domains of PTPÏ were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in Sf9 cells. Total cellular ... Figure 4 Figure 4 Tumor derived mutations in FNIII domains of PTPÏ are defective in cell-cell aggregation.

Discussion PTPRT/PTPÏ is the most highly mutated tyrosine phosphatase in human colon carcinomas. We and others found that PTPRT/ PTPÏ is also mutated in lung	 gastric and skin (melanoma) cancers (Forbes et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2004). The spectrum of mutations	 which included nonsense mutations and frameshifts	 suggested that these mutations were inactivating (Wang et al. 2004). Biochemical analyses demonstrated that missense mutations in the catalytic domains of PTPRT diminished its phosphatase activity and overexpression of PTPRT inhibited colon cancer cell growth. Moreover	 we showed previously that the tumor-derived mutations in the MAM and Ig domains of PTPÏ are defective in cell-cell adhesion (Yu et al. 2008). All these data suggest that PTPRT/PTPÏ normally functions as a tumor suppressor gene. The experiments presented in this manuscript evaluate the contribution of the individual extracellular domains of PTPÏ to PTPÏ-mediated adhesion. We demonstrate that in addition to the MAM and Ig domains	 the FNIII repeats are required for PTPÏ-mediated adhesion. Importantly	 we also show that PTPÏ-mediated adhesion is impaired by human tumor-derived mutations in those FNIII repeats. These studies indicate that all the tumor-derived mutations located in the extracellular domain of PTPRT are loss-of-function mutations	 thereby providing further evidence that PTPRT is a tumor suppressor. This notion is further supported by our recent study showing that PTPRT knockout mice are highly susceptible to colon specific carcinogen azoxymethane (AOM)-induced colon cancer (Zhao et al.).  PTPÎ¼-mediated cell-cell aggregation requires the MAM domain	 Ig domain	 and the first two FNIII repeats (Aricescu et al. 2006; Aricescu et al. 2007; Brady-Kalnay and Tonks 1994; Cismasiu et al. 2004; Zondag et al. 1995). The entire extracellular domain of PTPÎ¼ is predicted to make a rigid conformation with extensive interfaces between each of the domains (Aricescu et al. 2006). The minimal adhesive unit for functional cell-cell aggregation is the MAM domain	 Ig domain and the first two FNIII repeats (Aricescu et al. 2006; Brady-Kalnay and Tonks 1994; Zondag et al. 1995). However	 the FNIII repeats appear to play a role in spacing the key homophilic interaction domain(s) a certain distance from the plasma membrane. Deletion of the FNIII repeats changed the intercellular spacing of two apposing membranes (Aricescu et al. 2007). Cell-cell aggregation assays of the FNIII deletion constructs were not performed in that study (Aricescu et al. 2007). The amino acid residues of the interfaces between the extracellular domains are highly conserved between members of the type IIB RPTP subfamily (Aricescu et al. 2006; Aricescu et al. 2007) therefore it is likely that the PTPÏ adhesive interface resembles that of PTPÎ¼. Together our data support the hypothesis that the essential regions for PTPÏ-mediated adhesion resemble those of PTPÎ¼.  To gain insight into how the point mutations may alter the adhesive function of PTPÏ	 we modeled the human tumor derived PTPÏ mutations onto the crystal structure of PTPÎ¼ (Figure 5). The crystal structure of PTPÎ¼ includes only the first three FNIII repeats (Aricescu et al. 2007). Four of these mutations fall within the second FNIII (FNIII-2) repeat (I395V	 Y412F	 R453C	 Q479E). It is important to note that FNIII-2 is required for efficient cell-cell adhesion (Aricescu et al. 2006). Two of the mutations fall in the third FNIII (FNIII-3) repeat (S492F	 N510K). The mutation within the linker region between FNIII-1 and FNII-2 (Y412F) could alter the flexibility or positioning between the two domains. The other mutations (I395V R453C	 Q479E	 S492F	 N510K) appear to be clustered in surface exposed regions and/or near the linker regions between FNIII-2 and FNIII-3 that could alter flexibility	 position of individual FNIII repeats and/or protein-protein interactions. While these mutations do not correspond to the adhesive interface hypothesized for PTPÎ¼ based upon a single static crystal structure (Aricescu et al. 2007)	 some of the mutations fall within the FNIII-2 repeat which is required for adhesion	 and all of these surface modifications would likely alter either the three-dimensional topology and/or cis/trans interactions of PTPÏ.  Figure 5 Figure 5 Structural modeling of the point mutations of PTPÏ. The point mutations (indicated in red) evaluated in this manuscript were modeled onto the equivalent sites in the crystal structure of PTPÎ¼. The PTPÏ mutations likely alter cell-cell ... Other type IIB RPTPs also function as tumor suppressor genes	 by regulating adhesion and/or tyrosine phosphorylation of effector proteins. Expression of PTPÎ¼ is reduced in human glioblastomas (GBM) and cell lines (Burgoyne et al. 2009a). Reduction in full-length PTPÎ¼ expression with a concomitant increase in a proteolytically processed cytoplasmic fragment of PTPÎ¼ is observed in GBM cells and both are correlated with decreased adhesion and increased migration observed in the disease (Burgoyne et al. 2009a; Burgoyne et al. 2009b). Over-expression of the full-length form of PTPÎ¼ suppressed migration of GBM cells and reduces their survival (Burgoyne et al. 2009b). Of note	 at the same time that stable cell adhesion is reduced due to the loss of full-length PTPÎ¼ expression in GBM cells	 a catalytically active cytoplasmic fragment of PTPÎ¼ is released and translocates to the nucleus (Burgoyne et al. 2009b). Catalytic activity of this fragment is also necessary for cell migration and viability of GBM cells (Burgoyne et al. 2009b). Therefore	 both the tyrosine phosphatase activity of the cytoplasmic fragment of PTPÎ¼ and the loss of PTPÎ¼-mediated adhesion may contribute to the invasiveness of GBM cells.  PTPÎº is also implicated in tumor progression. PTPÎº expression is reduced in melanoma cell lines and human tissue biopsies (McArdle et al. 2001)	 and in Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma cells (Flavell et al. 2008). Over-expression of PTPÎº in Hodgkin lymphoma cells reduces cellular proliferation and survival (Flavell et al. 2008). Like PTPÎ¼	 PTPÎº is proteolytically processed (Anders et al. 2006)	 potentially as a result of aberrant glycosylation (Kim et al. 2006). It is not clear whether adhesion or catalytic activity of PTPÎº is required for its tumor suppressor activity (Flavell et al. 2008; Kim et al. 2006). Of note	 the cleaved cytoplasmic domain fragment of PTPÎº is catalytically active	 translocates to the nucleus and promotes Î²-catenin-mediated transcription (Anders et al. 2006). Signaling via the PTPÎº cytoplasmic fragment might augment the loss of stable cell-cell adhesion and may promote tumor progression.  Although speculative	 it is interesting to postulate that tyrosine phosphatase activity and or cleavage of PTPÏ will also be an important element of its tumor suppressor activity	 as has been demonstrated for PTPÎ¼ and PTPÎº. Interestingly	 we identified and validated STAT3 as a direct substrate of PTPRT (Zhang et al. 2007). STAT3 is latent transcription factor that translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus after being phosphorylated at the Y705 residue. It is possible that the cleaved intracellular fragment of PTPÏ	 which contains the phosphatase domains	 translocates to nucleus and dephosphorylates STAT3. Besco and colleagues found that PTPRT associates with the adhesion molecule E-cadherin and its binding partner p120 catenin	 which are PTPRT substrates (Besco et al. 2006). p120 also translocates to the nucleus and associates with the Kaiso transcription factor (Daniel and Reynolds 1999). Given the frequency and distribution of mutations in PTPRT/PTPÏ in human colon and other cancers	 a more thorough understanding of its biological function is warranted. 																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
4	61||Tyrosine phosphorylation	 regulated by protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) and kinases (PTKs)	 is important in signaling pathways underlying tumorigenesis. A mutational analysis of the tyrosine phosphatase gene superfamily in human cancers identified 83 somatic mutations in six PTPs (PTPRF	 PTPRG	 PTPRT	 PTPN3	 PTPN13	 PTPN14)	 affecting 26% of colorectal cancers and a smaller fraction of lung	 breast	 and gastric cancers. Fifteen mutations were nonsense	 frameshift	 or splice-site alterations predicted to result in truncated proteins lacking phosphatase activity. Five missense mutations in the most commonly altered PTP (PTPRT) were biochemically examined and found to reduce phosphatase activity. Expression of wild-type but not a mutant PTPRT in human cancer cells inhibited cell growth. These observations suggest that the mutated tyrosine phosphatases are tumor suppressor genes	 regulating cellular pathways that may be amenable to therapeutic intervention. Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues is a central feature of many cellular signaling pathways	 including those affecting growth	 differentiation	 cell cycle regulation	 apoptosis	 and invasion (1	 2). This phosphorylation is coordinately controlled by protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and phosphatases (PTPs). Although a variety of PTK genes have been directly linked to tumorigenesis through somatic activating mutations (3â€“6)	 only a few PTP genes have been implicated in cancer (7â€“10). Moreover	 it is not known how many or how frequently members of the PTP gene family are altered in any particular cancer type. We have systematically addressed these issues by comprehensive mutational analysis of the PTP gene superfamily in colorectal tumors.  The PTP gene superfamily is composed of three main families: (i) the classical PTPs	 including the receptor PTPs (RPTPs) and the nonreceptor PTPs (NRPTPs); (ii) the dual specificity phosphatases (DSPs)	 which can dephosphorylate serine and threonine in addition to tyrosine residues; and (iii) the low molecular weight phosphatases (LMPs) (1). Using an approach similar to that described in a recent bioinformatic analysis of PTPs in the mouse genome (11)	 we employed a combination of Hidden Markov Models representing catalytic domains of members of the PTP superfamily to identify 53 classical PTPs (21 RPTPs and 32 NRPTPs)	 33 DSPs	 and one LMP in the human genome (12). This analysis revealed a set of genes representing all known human PTPs (13) as well as seven putative PTPs.  As an initial screen to evaluate whether these phosphatases are genetically altered in human cancer	 we analyzed the coding exons of all 87 members of this gene superfamily in 18 colorectal cancers. A total of 1375 exons from all annotated RPTPs	 NRPTPs	 DSPs	 and LMPs were extracted from genomic databases (12). These exons were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from cancer genomic DNA samples and directly sequenced with dye terminator chemistry (12). Whenever a presumptive mutation was identified	 we attempted to determine whether it was somatically acquired (i.e.	 tumor specific) by examining the sequence of the gene in genomic DNA from normal tissue of the relevant patient.  From the 3.3 Mb of sequence information obtained	 we identified six genes containing somatic mutations	 including three members of the RPTP subfamily (PTPRF	 PTPRG	 and PTPRT) and three members of the NRPTP subfamily (PTPN3	 PTPN13	 and PTPN14). These six genes were then further analyzed for mutations in another 157 colorectal cancers. Through this strategy	 we identified 77 mutations in the six genes	 in aggregate affecting 26% of the colorectal tumors analyzed (table S1 and Fig. 1). Examination of these six genes in seven other tumor types identified PTPRT mutations in two of 11 (18%) lung cancers and two of 12 gastric cancers (17%)	 and PTPRF mutations in one of 11 (9%) lung cancers and one of 11 (9%) breast cancers. No mutations were identified in 12 pancreatic cancers	 12 ovarian cancers	 12 medulloblastomas	 or 12 glioblastomas (table S1 and Fig. 1). In total	 83 nonsynonymous mutations were observed	 all of which were somatic in the cancers that could be assessed (12).    Download high-res image  Open in new tab  Download Powerpoint Fig. 1.

Black stars indicate PTPRT mutants evaluated for phosphatase activity (Fig. 2)	 and the red star indicates PTPRT mutant evaluated for effects on cell proliferation (Fig. 3).  Fifteen of the 83 mutations were nonsense	 frameshift	 or splice-site alterations	 all of which were predicted to result in aberrant or truncated proteins. In 16 tumors both alleles of the phosphatase gene appeared to be mutated	 a characteristic often associated with tumor suppressor genes. The majority of tumors with PTP gene mutations also contained mutations in KRAS or BRAF	 and nine tumors contained alterations in previously reported tyrosine kinase genes (table S1). Thus	 the mutant phosphatases identified in this study are likely to operate through cellular pathways distinct from those associated with previously identified mutant kinases.  Analysis of mutations in tumors is complicated by the fact that mutations can arise either as functional alterations affecting key genes underlying the neoplastic process or as nonfunctional â€œpassengerâ€ changes. The multiple waves of clonal expansion and selection that occur throughout tumorigenesis lead to fixation of any mutation that had previously occurred in any predecessor cell	 regardless of whether the mutation was actually responsible for the clonal expansion. Two independent lines of evidence suggest that the sequence alterations we observed are functional. First	 the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations provides an indication of selection	 as synonymous alterations usually do not exert a growth advantage. There were no somatic synonymous mutations detected in the colorectal cancers analyzed	 resulting in a ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations of 77 to 0	 much higher than the expected 2:1 ratio for nonselected passenger mutations (P < 1 Ã— 10â€“6). Second	 the prevalence of mutations in the coding regions of the analyzed genes was âˆ¼19 per Mb of tumor DNA	 similar to the prevalence of functional somatic alterations observed in other gene families [e.g.	 the tyrosine kinome (6)] and significantly higher than the prevalence of nonfunctional alterations previously observed in the cancer genomes (âˆ¼1 per Mb	 P < 0.01) (14). These data support the idea that these mutations were the targets of selection during tumorigenesis.  The great majority of the nonsense and frameshift mutations (Fig. 1) would result in polypeptides devoid of C-terminal phosphatase catalytic domains	 thereby leading to inactivation of the phosphatase. To evaluate whether tumor-specific point mutations alter phosphatase activity	 we biochemically tested mutant versions of PTPRT	 the most frequently mutated PTP in the superfamily. Mutations in both intracellular PTP domains (D1 and D2) were evaluated. His-tagged versions of the catalytic region of wild-type PTPRT	 two D1 mutants (Q987K and N1128I)	 and three D2 mutants (R1212W	 R1346L	 and T1368M) were produced in bacteria and analyzed for phosphatase activity by using 6	8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (DiFMUP) as a substrate (Fig. 2) (12). All D1 and D2 mutants had reduced phosphatase activity compared with the wild-type protein (Fig. 2). The kinetic parameter Kcat was reduced in both D1 mutants	 while Km was increased in all three D2 mutants	 suggesting that mutations in the two domains may have different effects on enzymatic activity. Although it has been thought that the D2 domain is usually catalytically inactive (1)	 our results are consistent with recent studies that show that the D2 domain is important for phosphatase activity in some receptor phosphatases (15).

His-tagged versions of PTPRT protein segments comprising the two catalytic domains containing wild-type (WT) and tumor-specific mutant sequences were expressed in bacteria and purified using nickelaffinity chromatography. Equal amounts of WT and mutant proteins were used to evaluate enzyme kinetics. The rate of hydrolysis of substrate (DiFMUP) is plotted against increasing substrate concentration. Data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menton equation	 and the resulting kinetic parameters of WT and mutant proteins are indicated in (B).  These biochemical data on missense mutations	 coupled with the large number of truncating mutations	 suggested that PTPRT functions as a tumor suppressor gene. To determine whether PTPRT expression can inhibit tumor cell growth	 we transfected wild-type PTPRT into HCT116 colorectal cancer cells (12). An identical expression vector containing an R632X mutant of PTPRT was used for comparison. Wild-type PTPRT potently inhibited cell growth in this assay	 as seen by the substantial decrease in the number of neomycin-resistant colonies compared with the R632X mutant or with vector alone (Fig. 3	 A and B). Similar results with wild-type and mutant PTPRT were also observed in DLD1 colorectal cancer cells.    Download high-res image  Open in new tab  Download Powerpoint Fig. 3.

The photographs show colonies stained with crystal violet after 14 days of geneticin selection. (B) Number of resistant colonies (mean of two 25 cm2 flasks) for WT PTPRT	 mutant PTPRT	 and empty vector.  The combination of these genetic	 biochemical	 and cellular data suggest that PTPRT and the other identified phosphatases are likely to act as tumor suppressors. This is consistent with the function of other phosphatases implicated in tumorigenesis (7	8	 16) and with the general role of phosphatases in inhibiting various growth-promoting signaling pathways (2). The absence of biallelic mutations in a subset of the analyzed tumors suggests that some alterations may act in a dominant-negative fashion or may affect gene dosage	 mechanisms that have been previously involved in inactivation of other tumor suppressor genes (17	 18).  Little is known about the functional role of the tyrosine phosphatases discussed here. PTPN13 appears to be involved in apoptosis (19) and may be partly responsible for the antitumor effects of tamoxifen (20). Overexpression of PTPN3 inhibits growth of NIH/3T3 cells	 possibly through interaction with valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97) (21). PTPN14 and PTPRF are thought to play a role in cell adhesion by regulating tyrosine phosphorylation of adherens junction proteins (22	 23). Because increased phosphorylation of adherens junctions has been shown to increase cell motility and migration (22	 24)	 mutational inactivation of these genes may be an important step in cancer cell invasion and metastasis. PTPRG maps to chromosome 3p14.2	 a region frequently lost in lung	 renal	 and early-stage breast tumors	 and is thought to be a target of the translocation at 3p14 in familial renal cell carcinoma (25â€“27). However	 no point mutations in PTPRG (28) or any of the other genes identified here have been previously described in any cancer. PTPRT is expressed in the developing central nervous system and in the adult cerebellum (29) and had not been thought to play a role in the growth or differentiation of other tissues. We have found that PTPRT is expressed in a variety of human tissues	 including normal colon epithelium as well as cells derived from colorectal cancers (fig. S1).  Phosphatases affect signaling pathways that may be amenable to therapeutic intervention in cancer cells (2). Although reactivation of incapacitated phosphatases is likely to be pharmacologically challenging	 identification of the corresponding kinases that phosphorylate substrates normally regulated by the mutant phosphatases could provide novel therapeutic targets. Like the analysis of genetic alterations in tyrosine kinases (6)	 the present study suggests the possibility of individualized therapy based on the mutant phosphatases present in specific tumors. Conceivably	 this approach would have broad therapeutic use	 because more than 50% of colorectal tumors analyzed to date have alterations in at least one member of the tyrosine phosphatome or kinome. 																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							
4	62||Most cancers are characterized by increased STAT3 activation where phosphorylated STAT3 levels are associated with reduced survival. The molecular mechanisms underlying aberrant STAT3 phosphorylation/activation in human malignancies have been elusive. Our findings provide a mechanistic basis for tumor-specific STAT3 hyperactivation in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). We demonstrate that receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatases	 encoded by PTPR genes	 including PTPRT	 are commonly mutated in HNSCC where PTPR mutations are associated with increased phosphorylation of STAT3 in tumors. Several cancer-related PTPRT mutations localize to the substrate interaction surface of the enzyme catalytic domains. Expression of mutated PTPRT in HNSCC models markedly increases STAT3 activation	 promoting cellular survival. PTPRT mutations may therefore serve as predictive biomarkers for STAT3 pathway inhibitors	 suggesting new therapeutic opportunities.  Keywords: STAT3 activation	 driver mutations	 phosphatase mutations Go to: ABSTRACT The underpinnings of STAT3 hyperphosphorylation resulting in enhanced signaling and cancer progression are incompletely understood. Loss-of-function mutations of enzymes that dephosphorylate STAT3	 such as receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases	 which are encoded by the PTPR gene family	 represent a plausible mechanism of STAT3 hyperactivation. We analyzed whole exome sequencing (n = 374) and reverse-phase protein array data (n = 212) from head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). PTPR mutations are most common and are associated with significantly increased phospho-STAT3 expression in HNSCC tumors. Expression of receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase T (PTPRT) mutant proteins induces STAT3 phosphorylation and cell survival	 consistent with a â€œdriverâ€ phenotype. Computational modeling reveals functional consequences of PTPRT mutations on phospho-tyrosineâ€“substrate interactions. A high mutation rate (30%) of PTPRs was found in HNSCC and 14 other solid tumors	 suggesting that PTPR alterations	 in particular PTPRT mutations	 may define a subset of patients where STAT3 pathway inhibitors hold particular promise as effective therapeutic agents.  Tyrosine phosphorylation regulates a multitude of cellular processes by coordinately activating and inactivating signaling proteins. Aberrations of protein tyrosine phosphorylation and signaling are a hallmark for oncogenic events found in most human cancers. The phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of tyrosine residues on signaling proteins is directly mediated by protein tyrosine kinases and phosphatases. Although many cellular factors are known to dynamically control the activity of these enzymes	 genetic alterations of kinases and phosphatases in human cancers lead to perturbations in the levels of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins	 uncontrolled cell growth	 and tumor formation. Although activating mutations of tyrosine kinases have been extensively studied (1	 2)	 cancer-associated mutations of tyrosine phosphatases remain incompletely understood	 partly due to the lack of comprehensive genomic analysis of these large arrays of phosphatases	 as well as their largely unknown and often ambiguous actions in normal physiology and cancer biology.  Among the 107 known protein tyrosine phosphatases	 the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) represent the largest family of the human tyrosine phosphatome	 comprising 21 family members (3). These RPTPs are believed to be crucial for the regulation of inter- as well as intracellular signaling due to the cell-surface localization of RPTPs. Selected members of the RPTP family have been reported to function as tumor suppressors	 where gene mutation	 deletion	 or methylation may contribute to the cancer phenotype (3).  STAT3 is an oncogene	 and constitutive STAT3 activation is a hallmark of human cancers. Activating STAT3 mutations are rare in all cancers studied to date	 including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) (4). Although activating mutations of upstream receptor tyrosine kinases leading to increased STAT3 phosphorylation characterize some malignancies [e.g.	 EGFR mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (5)]	 most cancers lack these alterations yet harbor elevated phospho-STAT3 (p-STAT3) levels. We (Z.W.) previously reported that STAT3 serves as a substrate for wild-type PTPRT enzyme (also known as RPTP-T	 RPTPÏ	 or RPTPrho) in colorectal cancer cells (SW480 and HT29) and HEK293T cells (6). STAT3 has additionally been reported to be a substrate of PTPRD (also known as PTPÎ´) in glioblastoma models	 suggesting that several RPTP family members may exhibit tumor-suppressive function by dephosphorylating STAT3 (7). In the present study	 we hypothesized that mutation of RPTP family members	 including PTPRT	 results in elevated expression levels of tyrosine phosphorylated STAT3 in human HNSCC. Analysis of reverse-phase protein array and sequencing data demonstrated significant association between PTPR mutation and increased p-STAT3 expression levels in HNSCC	 establishing the de novo signaling consequence of PTPR mutations on a major oncogenic pathway that drives human carcinogenesis. Studies in HNSCC models demonstrate that PTPRT mutations induce p-STAT3 and HNSCC survival	 consistent with a â€œdriverâ€ phenotype whereas computational modeling revealed functional implications of PTPR mutations on phospho-tyrosine (p-Tyr)â€“substrate interactions. Analysis of whole-exome sequencing results of 374 primary head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) revealed that PTPR genes are mutated in nearly one-third (30.7%) of HNSCC tumors	 compared with a 15.2% mutation rate in the cytoplasmic protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family. This pattern is strikingly consistent across an additional 14 types of solid tumors sequenced to date	 implicating a potentially important pathologic contribution of PTPR mutations to human carcinogenesis. These cumulative findings suggest that genetic alterations of selected PTPRs	 including PTPRT	 may induce STAT3 activation and serve as predictive biomarkers for treatment with emerging STAT3 pathway inhibitors.  Go to: RESULTS PTPR Mutations Significantly Correlate with in Situ p-STAT3(Y705) Up-Regulation in HNSCC Patient Tumors. To date	 associations between PTPR alterations and human cancers have relied on cell-line models. It remains undetermined whether tumor-specific mutations of these key tyrosine phosphatases mediate STAT3 hyperactivation in human tumors	 including HNSCC. Using reverse phase protein array (RPPA)	 we conducted an integrative proteomic-genomic analysis on HNSCC patient tumors. We sought to determine whether PTPR mutation is correlated with altered STAT3(Y705) phosphorylation in primary HNSCC tumor specimens. Strikingly	 examination of 212 HNSCC primary tumors showed that tumors harboring mutations in PTPR tumor suppressor genes (including PTPRD/J/K/M/O/S/T) (3) expressed significantly higher levels of p-STAT3(Y705) compared with tumors with wild-type PTPR family members (P = 0.02) (Fig. 1A). These results provide evidence of a direct association between PTPR mutation and elevated STAT3 phosphorylation/activation in human tumors in situ and establish a plausible mechanism for STAT3 hyperactivation in human cancers. In contrast	 we observed no correlation between p-STAT3(Y705) expression and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)	 p-EGFR(Y1068)	 p-EGFR(Y1173)	 suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)	 Src	 or interleukin 6 (IL6) expression. Additionally	 HNSCC tumors harboring multiple PTPR mutations exhibited an even greater increase in p-STAT3(Y705) expression although the number of tumors in these groups is insufficient for statistical analysis (n = 14	2	1	 or 1	 for tumors with 2	3	4	 or 5 PTPR mutations per tumor	 respectively). Upregulation of p-STAT3(Y705) was further confirmed by immunohistochemistry in HNSCC tumors harboring PTPR mutations (Fig. S1) and in HNSCC cell lines harboring endogenous PTPR mutations (Fig. S2).  Fig. 1. Fig. 1. PTPR mutations correlate with STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation in HNSCC tumors and enhance survival and STAT3 phosphorylation in HNSCC cells. (A) Significant increase in p-STAT3(Y705) expression (intensity plot in log2 scale; protein array data from The ... PTPRT Mutations â€œDriveâ€ HNSCC Cell Survival and STAT3 Activation. The biologic/functional consequences of tumor-derived PTPR mutations in HNSCC are unknown. To determine whether HNSCC PTPRT mutations act as â€œdrivers	â€ we developed a serum-dependent HNSCC cell line (PCI-52-SD1) that undergoes rapid cell death in the absence of serum. Using this model	 stable expression of two representative mutants (calculated to result in both charge and amino acid size changes) (Table S1)	 PTPRT(A1022E) and PTPRT(R1040L)	 conferred increased survival (3.2- and 6.2-fold	 respectively) compared with expression of empty vector control	 confirming a driver phenotype for these PTPRT mutants in HNSCC cells (Fig. 1B).  To investigate the mechanism responsible for the driver phenotype of the PTPRT mutants	 we tested the hypothesis that PTPRT mutations identified in HNSCC may impair the phosphatase activity of the enzyme	 resulting in increased phosphorylation of PTPRT substrates	 including the oncogenic transcription factor STAT3. Stable expression of wild-type PTPRT in PCI-52-SD1 cells resulted in reduction of basal p-STAT3 levels by âˆ¼48% (P = 0.0014) (Fig. 1C)	 demonstrating that wild-type PTPRT can modulate STAT3 activation in HNSCC cells. On the other hand	 expression of a PTPRT protein harboring a mutation (A1022E) in the catalytic domain promoted up-regulation of the p-STAT3 protein in an HNSCC cell line with low basal levels of p-STAT3 (CAL-33) (Fig. 1D). Similar effects were observed in HEK293 cells upon transient expression of a PTPRT mutant (Fig. S3). Interestingly	 expression of a PTPRT protein with a mutation (P497T) in the extracellular fibronectin type III-like domain did not alter the phosphorylation status of STAT3 (Fig. 1D)	 suggesting that mutations outside the catalytic domains may have other mechanisms of action. In addition	 expression of wild-type PTPRT in EGFR-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts resulted in decreased expression of p-STAT3(Y705)	 suggesting that PTPRT catalytic activity is independent of EGFR expression/activity (Fig. S4).  Computational Modeling of PTPRT Mutations in the Substrate Binding Sites Reveals Plausible Functional Alterations of Phosphatase Activity. Given that a high percentage of PTPRT mutations are located within the enzymatic (PTPase) domain	 we sought to determine the potential impact of these mutations on interactions between the catalytic domains and phospho-tyrosine substrate using a molecular modeling approach. Although the structure of a PTPRTâ€“p-Tyr protein complex is not available	 the X-ray crystallographic structure of the PTPRT phosphatase domain alone has been reported (PDB ID code 2OOQ) (8). Therefore	 we determined by homology modeling (9)	 the approximate substrate-interacting surface of the PTPRT PTPase domains 1 and 2 (Fig. 2 Aâ€“D) based on the highly similar (to PTPRT) crystal structure of human tyrosine phosphatase PTPN5 in complex with p-Tyr (detailed in Materials and Methods). Using this model	 we localized several cancer-related PTPRT mutation sites to the substrate-interaction surface of the PTPRT PTPase domains 1 and 2 in close proximity to incorporated p-Tyr (D905	 R928	 H1053	 G1089	 and V1124 in domain 1; Q1180	 R1201	 R1207	 P1213	 Q1286	 T1346	 N1380	 G1382	 and R1384 in domain 2). Mutation sites previously shown to decrease the PTPRT phosphatase activity were also found in proximity to p-Tyr regions (C1084	 D1052	 Y893	 Q965	 R1188	 and T1346) (10	 11). These results suggest that PTPRT PTPase domain mutations	 which are found in human cancers	 likely interfere with enzymatic activity and/or substrate interactions. Of note	 in addition to the reported missense mutations of the PTPRT PTPase domains	 many nonsense mutations (mutation to a stop codon) and frameshift mutations are highly likely to alter PTPRT structure and stability	 as well as impacting substrate interactions (L362fs	 R617fs	 Q434*	 and Q615* found in HNSCC	 and E1227*	 R1207*	 E1155*	 R1358*	 and G1386* in other cancers; COSMIC database).

PTPR Genes Are Mutated in Nearly One-Third of HNSCC Tumors	 and PTPRT Is the Most Frequently Mutated PTPR. PTPRT belongs to the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase family	 which comprises 21 members	 and no genomic study to date has examined the mutational profile of the entire family in a large number of human tumor specimens. To understand the potential genetic contributions of the PTPR family (in addition to PTPRT) to tyrosine signaling/regulation in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)	 we comprehensively analyzed PTPR family mutations in large cohorts of primary HNSCC tumors. Whole-exome sequencing data of 374 primary HNSCCs were included [from 300 TCGA HNSCC tumors and 74 HNSCCs previously published (12)]. Strikingly	 30.7% (115/374) of HNSCC tumors harbored nonsynonymous somatic mutations of at least one PTPR family member	 compared with only 15.2% (57/374) of tumors with mutations of cytoplasmic PTP genes	 the second major family of PTPs (Fig. 3A). Further	 7.8% (29/374) of HNSCC tumors contained multiple mutations of PTPR family members (from two to six PTPR mutations/tumor) (Fig. 3B) (Table S2 contains all PTPR mutations found in HNSCC). Further investigation demonstrated that this high rate of somatic mutation of the PTPR family (vs. cytoplasmic PTPs) found in HNSCC is also detected in all 14 types of human solid tumors sequenced to date by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (4	039 total solid tumors sequenced)	 but not in a hematopoietic malignancy (6/196 AML cases; 3.1%) (Fig. 3C and Table S3)	 implicating a likely pathologic involvement of PTPR mutations in HNSCC	 as well as other solid human tumors.  Fig. 3. Fig. 3. Whole-exome sequencing of human cancers demonstrates high rates of PTPR somatic mutations. (A) Frequencies of PTPR (the receptor subtype) and cytoplasmic PTP somatic mutations in 374 HNSCC tumors. (B) A subset (29/374	 7.8%) of HNSCC tumors harbor mutations ... Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is a known etiologic factor in a subset of HNSCC and is capable of disrupting genome stability. Thus	 we examined whether HPV was associated with the high rate of PTPR mutations in HNSCC. Statistical analysis showed no correlation between PTPR mutation and HPV status (P = 0.31; PTPR mutations in 11/48 HPV-positive tumors vs. 93/299 HPV-negative tumors)	 indicating that HPV is not a contributing factor to PTPR mutations in HNSCC. Further analysis showed that PTPR mutations were not associated with mutations of TP53 (P = 0.81)	 NOTCH1 (P = 0.24)	 PIK3CA (P = 0.47)	 or HRAS (P = 0.77) in HNSCC	 indicating that PTPR mutations are independent of these known common mutational events in HNSCC tumors (12).  The availability of comprehensive whole-exome sequencing data (from TCGA) on all PTPR genes allowed us to identify the most commonly mutated PTPRs in all sequenced human cancers	 including HNSCC. Among the 374 sequenced HNSCC tumors	 PTPRT is the most frequently mutated PTPR (5.6% cases; 22 mutations total	 with one tumor harboring 2 PTPRT mutations)	 followed by PTPRC	 PTPRD	 and PTPRM (Table S2). Although PTPR mutation rates vary among different cancer types	 cumulative results reveal that PTPRT is the single most commonly mutated PTPR in human cancers (6.2%	 285 mutations in 4	609 solid and hematopoietic cancers sequenced) (Table S3)	 with the highest mutation frequency of PTPRT in cutaneous melanoma (a total of 99 mutations in 253 tumors sequenced; 39.1%).  The sites of the most frequently mutated PTPR members (PTPRT/C/D/M) in HNSCC are shown in Fig. 3D (all other HNSCC-associated PTPR mutations are shown in Fig. S5). Cumulative mutation data for PTPRT in 16 types of sequenced tumors indicate that 37.9% (108/285) of PTPRT mutations are found in the catalytic phosphatase (PTPase) domain whereas 33.0% (94/285) occur in the extracellular fibronectin type III-like (FN3) domain. In HNSCC	 45.5% (10/22) of PTPRT mutations are located in the PTPase domain (Fig. 3D)	 indicating the pathologic relevance of these genetic alterations of the phosphatase activity	 which lead to pSTAT3 up-regulation in HNSCC tumors.  Go to: DISCUSSION These cumulative results indicate that selected tumor-associated PTPRT mutations can alter STAT3 phosphorylation/activation. Our findings suggest a previously undescribed	 and potentially common	 mechanism for dysregulated cell survival and growth involving PTPR mutation and STAT3 hyperactivation. Therefore	 tumors that harbor PTPR (including PTPRT) mutations may be amenable to treatment with STAT3 pathway inhibitors. The frequency of PTPR mutations is unexpectedly high across all solid tumor types analyzed to date. The dispersed distribution and lack of hotspot mutations in PTPR genes suggest that these mutations likely represent loss-of-function events affecting tumor suppressive proteins rather than gain-of-function of oncogenic proteins in cancer. Although this mutation pattern is consistent with that reported for select PTPRs in colorectal cancers (10)	 this study represents a comprehensive analysis of somatic mutations of the entire PTPR family across all human cancers sequenced to date.  Constitutive STAT3 activation is frequently found in nearly all human cancers	 and expression levels of p-STAT3(Y705) are often associated with poor prognosis (13â€“15). Mechanisms driving STAT3 activation in cancer are incompletely understood. Direct sequencing of thousands of patient tumors by TCGA has not identified common or consistent STAT3 mutational events in solid tumors. Furthermore	 solid tumors	 including HNSCC	 exhibit a lack of activating mutations in kinases upstream of STAT3 (4). Thus	 activating mutations of STAT3	 or of direct upstream positive regulators	 are unlikely to be the key genetic factors driving STAT3 hyperactivation in human cancers. PTPRT has been reported to be a negative regulator of STAT3 (6). Our integrative genomic-proteomic findings establish that PTPRT mutations are important genetic events that drive in situ up-regulation of p-STAT3(Y705) within patient tumors. This reveals the driver role of genetic mutations in a negative regulator(s) of STAT3	 an important oncogenic signaling protein in human cancer. PTPRT has been previously shown to be a tumor suppressor (in colon cancer cell line models)	 consistent with our present findings (16). Our results suggest that loss-of-function mutations in tumor suppressor tyrosine phosphatases may not only serve as permissive factors for oncogenesis as previously demonstrated	 but can also act as direct drivers for cancer cell growth via dysregulation of substrate tyrosine phosphorylation.  Studies of PTPRT	 in particular	 showed that PTPRT has a discretely defined set of substrates	 including STAT3 and paxillin. In our current study	 the correlation between paxillin phosphorylation and PTPRT mutations was not examined	 as antiâ€“phospho-paxillin antibody has not been validated for our protein array platform. However	 it is possible that paxillin signaling may also be affected by PTPRT mutations in the human tumors.  Computational modeling allows us to predict the potential effects of PTPase domain mutations (located intracellularly) in PTPRT	 which may be applicable to other RPTP proteins. However	 there are no existing computational methodologies to reliably predict the effects of the extracellular domain mutations (such as the FN3 domain mutations) found in these proteins. The broad existence of these extracellular domain mutations in the RPTP family will require systematic functional validation of each mutation in relevant cell models	 as we have previously shown that some of these mutations could alter cellâ€“cell adhesion	 and thereby promote tumor cell migration (17).  The present study demonstrates that wild-type PTPRT promotes down-regulation of p-STAT3(Y705) in HNSCC and that somatic PTPRT mutations may represent â€œdrivingâ€ events in cancer. We identify that somatic PTPR mutations	 including PTPRT mutations	 are associated with elevated p-STAT3(Y705) in human HNSCC. Other RPTP family members	 especially PTPRD	 may play similar roles in HNSCC and other solid tumors	 where somatic mutation may lead to loss-of-function and subsequent activation of oncogenic pathways. Indeed	 several commonly mutated PTPRs have been implicated as tumor suppressors	 including PTPRD (18)	 PTPRF (10)	 PTPRG (10	 19)	 PTPRJ (20)	 and PTPRS (21).  In conclusion	 PTPR mutational events are relatively common in primary HNSCC	 as well as in many other solid tumors as revealed by large-scale whole-exome sequencing studies. We demonstrate that tumor-specific mutational events in the PTPRT gene can serve as direct drivers for tumor growth by inducing hyperactivation of STAT3	 a potent oncogenic transcription factor and PTPRT substrate. STAT3 pathway inhibitors are under active investigation in human cancers and include transcription factor decoys	 disruptors of recruitment of STAT3 to the IL6/IL6Ralpha/gp130 complex	 and upstream kinase inhibitors	 primarily Janus kinase inhibitors (22	 23). It is biologically plausible that selected PTPR mutations may identify tumors that may be particularly responsive to treatment with STAT3 pathway inhibitors.  																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	
4	63||Tyrosine phosphorylation	 regulated by protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) and kinases (PTKs)	 is important in signaling pathways underlying tumorigenesis. A mutational analysis of the tyrosine phosphatase gene superfamily in human cancers identified 83 somatic mutations in six PTPs (PTPRF	 PTPRG	 PTPRT	 PTPN3	 PTPN13	 PTPN14)	 affecting 26% of colorectal cancers and a smaller fraction of lung	 breast	 and gastric cancers. Fifteen mutations were nonsense	 frameshift	 or splice-site alterations predicted to result in truncated proteins lacking phosphatase activity. Five missense mutations in the most commonly altered PTP (PTPRT) were biochemically examined and found to reduce phosphatase activity. Expression of wild-type but not a mutant PTPRT in human cancer cells inhibited cell growth. These observations suggest that the mutated tyrosine phosphatases are tumor suppressor genes	 regulating cellular pathways that may be amenable to therapeutic intervention. Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues is a central feature of many cellular signaling pathways	 including those affecting growth	 differentiation	 cell cycle regulation	 apoptosis	 and invasion (1	 2). This phosphorylation is coordinately controlled by protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and phosphatases (PTPs). Although a variety of PTK genes have been directly linked to tumorigenesis through somatic activating mutations (3â€“6)	 only a few PTP genes have been implicated in cancer (7â€“10). Moreover	 it is not known how many or how frequently members of the PTP gene family are altered in any particular cancer type. We have systematically addressed these issues by comprehensive mutational analysis of the PTP gene superfamily in colorectal tumors.  The PTP gene superfamily is composed of three main families: (i) the classical PTPs	 including the receptor PTPs (RPTPs) and the nonreceptor PTPs (NRPTPs); (ii) the dual specificity phosphatases (DSPs)	 which can dephosphorylate serine and threonine in addition to tyrosine residues; and (iii) the low molecular weight phosphatases (LMPs) (1). Using an approach similar to that described in a recent bioinformatic analysis of PTPs in the mouse genome (11)	 we employed a combination of Hidden Markov Models representing catalytic domains of members of the PTP superfamily to identify 53 classical PTPs (21 RPTPs and 32 NRPTPs)	 33 DSPs	 and one LMP in the human genome (12). This analysis revealed a set of genes representing all known human PTPs (13) as well as seven putative PTPs.  As an initial screen to evaluate whether these phosphatases are genetically altered in human cancer	 we analyzed the coding exons of all 87 members of this gene superfamily in 18 colorectal cancers. A total of 1375 exons from all annotated RPTPs	 NRPTPs	 DSPs	 and LMPs were extracted from genomic databases (12). These exons were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from cancer genomic DNA samples and directly sequenced with dye terminator chemistry (12). Whenever a presumptive mutation was identified	 we attempted to determine whether it was somatically acquired (i.e.	 tumor specific) by examining the sequence of the gene in genomic DNA from normal tissue of the relevant patient.  From the 3.3 Mb of sequence information obtained	 we identified six genes containing somatic mutations	 including three members of the RPTP subfamily (PTPRF	 PTPRG	 and PTPRT) and three members of the NRPTP subfamily (PTPN3	 PTPN13	 and PTPN14). These six genes were then further analyzed for mutations in another 157 colorectal cancers. Through this strategy	 we identified 77 mutations in the six genes	 in aggregate affecting 26% of the colorectal tumors analyzed (table S1 and Fig. 1). Examination of these six genes in seven other tumor types identified PTPRT mutations in two of 11 (18%) lung cancers and two of 12 gastric cancers (17%)	 and PTPRF mutations in one of 11 (9%) lung cancers and one of 11 (9%) breast cancers. No mutations were identified in 12 pancreatic cancers	 12 ovarian cancers	 12 medulloblastomas	 or 12 glioblastomas (table S1 and Fig. 1). In total	 83 nonsynonymous mutations were observed	 all of which were somatic in the cancers that could be assessed (12).    Download high-res image  Open in new tab  Download Powerpoint Fig. 1.

Black stars indicate PTPRT mutants evaluated for phosphatase activity (Fig. 2)	 and the red star indicates PTPRT mutant evaluated for effects on cell proliferation (Fig. 3).  Fifteen of the 83 mutations were nonsense	 frameshift	 or splice-site alterations	 all of which were predicted to result in aberrant or truncated proteins. In 16 tumors both alleles of the phosphatase gene appeared to be mutated	 a characteristic often associated with tumor suppressor genes. The majority of tumors with PTP gene mutations also contained mutations in KRAS or BRAF	 and nine tumors contained alterations in previously reported tyrosine kinase genes (table S1). Thus	 the mutant phosphatases identified in this study are likely to operate through cellular pathways distinct from those associated with previously identified mutant kinases.  Analysis of mutations in tumors is complicated by the fact that mutations can arise either as functional alterations affecting key genes underlying the neoplastic process or as nonfunctional â€œpassengerâ€ changes. The multiple waves of clonal expansion and selection that occur throughout tumorigenesis lead to fixation of any mutation that had previously occurred in any predecessor cell	 regardless of whether the mutation was actually responsible for the clonal expansion. Two independent lines of evidence suggest that the sequence alterations we observed are functional. First	 the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations provides an indication of selection	 as synonymous alterations usually do not exert a growth advantage. There were no somatic synonymous mutations detected in the colorectal cancers analyzed	 resulting in a ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations of 77 to 0	 much higher than the expected 2:1 ratio for nonselected passenger mutations (P < 1 Ã— 10â€“6). Second	 the prevalence of mutations in the coding regions of the analyzed genes was âˆ¼19 per Mb of tumor DNA	 similar to the prevalence of functional somatic alterations observed in other gene families [e.g.	 the tyrosine kinome (6)] and significantly higher than the prevalence of nonfunctional alterations previously observed in the cancer genomes (âˆ¼1 per Mb	 P < 0.01) (14). These data support the idea that these mutations were the targets of selection during tumorigenesis.  The great majority of the nonsense and frameshift mutations (Fig. 1) would result in polypeptides devoid of C-terminal phosphatase catalytic domains	 thereby leading to inactivation of the phosphatase. To evaluate whether tumor-specific point mutations alter phosphatase activity	 we biochemically tested mutant versions of PTPRT	 the most frequently mutated PTP in the superfamily. Mutations in both intracellular PTP domains (D1 and D2) were evaluated. His-tagged versions of the catalytic region of wild-type PTPRT	 two D1 mutants (Q987K and N1128I)	 and three D2 mutants (R1212W	 R1346L	 and T1368M) were produced in bacteria and analyzed for phosphatase activity by using 6	8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (DiFMUP) as a substrate (Fig. 2) (12). All D1 and D2 mutants had reduced phosphatase activity compared with the wild-type protein (Fig. 2). The kinetic parameter Kcat was reduced in both D1 mutants	 while Km was increased in all three D2 mutants	 suggesting that mutations in the two domains may have different effects on enzymatic activity. Although it has been thought that the D2 domain is usually catalytically inactive (1)	 our results are consistent with recent studies that show that the D2 domain is important for phosphatase activity in some receptor phosphatases (15).

Data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menton equation	 and the resulting kinetic parameters of WT and mutant proteins are indicated in (B).  These biochemical data on missense mutations	 coupled with the large number of truncating mutations	 suggested that PTPRT functions as a tumor suppressor gene. To determine whether PTPRT expression can inhibit tumor cell growth	 we transfected wild-type PTPRT into HCT116 colorectal cancer cells (12). An identical expression vector containing an R632X mutant of PTPRT was used for comparison. Wild-type PTPRT potently inhibited cell growth in this assay	 as seen by the substantial decrease in the number of neomycin-resistant colonies compared with the R632X mutant or with vector alone (Fig. 3	 A and B). Similar results with wild-type and mutant PTPRT were also observed in DLD1 colorectal cancer cells.    Download high-res image  Open in new tab  Download Powerpoint Fig. 3.

The photographs show colonies stained with crystal violet after 14 days of geneticin selection. (B) Number of resistant colonies (mean of two 25 cm2 flasks) for WT PTPRT	 mutant PTPRT	 and empty vector.  The combination of these genetic	 biochemical	 and cellular data suggest that PTPRT and the other identified phosphatases are likely to act as tumor suppressors. This is consistent with the function of other phosphatases implicated in tumorigenesis (7	8	 16) and with the general role of phosphatases in inhibiting various growth-promoting signaling pathways (2). The absence of biallelic mutations in a subset of the analyzed tumors suggests that some alterations may act in a dominant-negative fashion or may affect gene dosage	 mechanisms that have been previously involved in inactivation of other tumor suppressor genes (17	 18).  Little is known about the functional role of the tyrosine phosphatases discussed here. PTPN13 appears to be involved in apoptosis (19) and may be partly responsible for the antitumor effects of tamoxifen (20). Overexpression of PTPN3 inhibits growth of NIH/3T3 cells	 possibly through interaction with valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97) (21). PTPN14 and PTPRF are thought to play a role in cell adhesion by regulating tyrosine phosphorylation of adherens junction proteins (22	 23). Because increased phosphorylation of adherens junctions has been shown to increase cell motility and migration (22	 24)	 mutational inactivation of these genes may be an important step in cancer cell invasion and metastasis. PTPRG maps to chromosome 3p14.2	 a region frequently lost in lung	 renal	 and early-stage breast tumors	 and is thought to be a target of the translocation at 3p14 in familial renal cell carcinoma (25â€“27). However	 no point mutations in PTPRG (28) or any of the other genes identified here have been previously described in any cancer. PTPRT is expressed in the developing central nervous system and in the adult cerebellum (29) and had not been thought to play a role in the growth or differentiation of other tissues. We have found that PTPRT is expressed in a variety of human tissues	 including normal colon epithelium as well as cells derived from colorectal cancers (fig. S1).  Phosphatases affect signaling pathways that may be amenable to therapeutic intervention in cancer cells (2). Although reactivation of incapacitated phosphatases is likely to be pharmacologically challenging	 identification of the corresponding kinases that phosphorylate substrates normally regulated by the mutant phosphatases could provide novel therapeutic targets. Like the analysis of genetic alterations in tyrosine kinases (6)	 the present study suggests the possibility of individualized therapy based on the mutant phosphatases present in specific tumors. Conceivably	 this approach would have broad therapeutic use	 because more than 50% of colorectal tumors analyzed to date have alterations in at least one member of the tyrosine phosphatome or kinome. Protein tyrosine phosphatase Ï (PTPÏ) belongs to the classical receptor type IIB family of protein tyrosine phosphatase	 the most frequently mutated tyrosine phosphatase in human cancer. There are evidences to suggest that PTPÏ may act as a tumor suppressor gene and dysregulation of Tyr phosphorylation can be observed in diverse diseases	 such as diabetes	 immune deficiencies and cancer. PTPÏ variants in the catalytic domain have been identified in cancer tissues. These natural variants are nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms	 variations of a single nucleotide occurring in the coding region and leading to amino acid substitutions. In this study we investigated the effect of amino acid substitution on the structural stability and on the activity of the membrane-proximal catalytic domain of PTPÏ. We expressed and purified as soluble recombinant proteins some of the mutants of the membrane-proximal catalytic domain of PTPÏ identified in colorectal cancer and in the single nucleotide polymorphisms database. The mutants show a decreased thermal and thermodynamic stability and decreased activation energy relative to phosphatase activity	 when compared to wild- type. All the variants show three-state equilibrium unfolding transitions similar to that of the wild- type	 with the accumulation of a folding intermediate populated at âˆ¼4.0 M urea.  Go to: Introduction The classical protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) superfamily includes 38 proteins which specifically dephosphorylate phosphotyrosine residues and	 in concert with protein tyrosine kinases	 control a large number of diverse biological processes	 such as cell proliferation	 adhesion	 apoptosis and migration [1]â€“[6]. Reversible tyrosine phosphorylation controls numerous signaling pathways which require a right balance between kinase and phosphatase activity. The involvement of PTP in controlling cellular signaling has been largely recognized [2]	 [5]	 [7]	 though the role of PTP in human diseases has not been explored so extensively as that of protein kinases. However in diverse diseases	 such as cancer	 diabetes and immune deficiencies	 dysregulation of Tyr phosphorylation has been observed [4]	 [7]	 [8].  On the basis of their counteracting activity on the oncogenic protein tyrosine kinase	 PTPs have been initially considered as potential tumor suppressors	 however it is clear that several phosphatases have oncogenic properties [2]â€“[6]	 [9]. Over the last decade a limited number of phophatases have been studied systematically to evaluate their role in tumorigenesis. In particular	 six mutated phosphatases have been directly linked to colorectal cancers [1]	 [10]; among the six mutated genes	 the PTPRT gene encoding PTPÏ (PDB accession code 2OOQ) was found to be most frequently mutated and it was also mutated in about 20% of lung and gastric cancer [10].  PTPÏ belongs to the classical receptor type IIB family of PTP. The 107 PTPs encoded by the human genome are classified into four classes	 on the basis of the amino acid sequence of their catalytic domain. Class I includes 61 dual-specificity phosphatases and 38 classical phosphotyrosine-specific phosphatase which are further divided into receptor and non-transmembrane groups [5]	 [7]. The full-length PTPÏ contains an extracellular domain	 formed by a meprin-A5 antigen-PTP (MAM) domain and Ig-like and fibronectin type III-like repeats	 a single transmembrane segment and one or two cytoplasmic catalytic domains. The catalytically active proximal D1 domain is adjacent to the membrane and is connected to the inactive membrane-distal D2 domain [3]	 [5]. The PTP membrane-proximal catalytic domain consists of about 280 residues that fold into a highly conserved Î±/Î² structure [4]	 [11]. Conserved functional elements of the catalytic PTP domain are the PTP signature motif	 the mobile â€œWPDâ€ loop	 a highly conserved aspartate residue required for catalysis and the phosphotyrosine recognition loop.  In cancer tissues several PTPÏ variants in the catalytic domain have been identified and there is evidence to suggest that PTPÏ may act as a tumor suppressor gene [10]. These natural variants are nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs)	 single nucleotide variations occurring in the coding region and leading to a polypeptide sequence with amino acid substitutions.  A large number of amino acid substitutions originate from nsSNPs and an increasingly large number of diseases and defects reported in Human Gene Mutation Database [12] and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) [13] are referred to nsSNPs [14]. Although most nsSNPs are considered not to affect protein function	 computational analysis predicts that around 30% of protein variants resulting from nsSNPs are less stable than the most common variant [15]. The effect of disease-causing nsSNPs on protein structure and function has been widely investigated by computational analysis	 and change in protein stability has been suggested as the most common mechanism involved in monogenic disease [16]â€“[18]. However	 nsSNPs may also affect and modulate the protein function by altering protein dynamics without affecting protein stability [19]. Notably	 since genetic variations related to nsSNPs may influence individual susceptibility to complex diseases such as cancer [20] or response to drugs	 a more extended study about the effect of nsSNPs on protein structure may help in understanding their role in inducing protein functional changes [21]. To date there are few experimental data available concerning the consequences of nsSNPs on protein function and stability.  In this study we investigate the effect of amino acid substitutions identified in colorectal cancer [10] and in the single nucleotide polymorphisms database [18]	 [22]	 [23] on the thermodynamic stability and on the activity of the membrane-proximal catalytic domain of PTPÏ [1]	 [24]. The analysis revealed that	 in comparison to the wild-type	 the thermal and thermodynamic stability of all the mutants are decreased as well as the activation energy relative to the phosphatase activity	 indicating an increase in protein flexibility of all the PTPÏ mutants. All the variants show three-state equilibrium unfolding transitions similar to that of the wild-type	 with the accumulation of a folding intermediate at âˆ¼4.0 M urea.  To our knowledge	 this study represents the first spectroscopic and thermodynamic characterization of human PTPÏ catalytic domain and some of its mutants found in cancer. In addition	 the effects of none of the mutations reported in this manuscript on protein thermodynamic stability has been previously investigated.  Go to: Results Four mutations of the PTPÏ membrane-proximal catalytic domain in public databases have been identified: D927G	 Q987K	 N1128I and A1118P. Introduction of these mutations resulted in soluble recombinant protein only for D927G	 Q987K and N1128I whereas the A1118P mutant could not be expressed in the soluble fraction even when different growth and induction conditions were used. Mapping of the mutations onto the structure of the PTPÏ catalytic domain revealed that A1118P is located in the middle of a central helix (Fig. 1). It is likely that the introduction of a proline residue at this position in substitution of alanine will break the helical secondary structure resulting in misfolding of the catalytic domain. N1128 is located at the C-terminal end of the same helix (Fig. 1B). This residue is located in a very polar environment with flanking acidic (E1124	 E1127	 E1129) and a histidine residue (H974) located in a neighbouring loop region. D927G and Q987K are located in solvent exposed loops with little interaction with other amino acid side chains (Fig. 1C). The solvent accessibility of the mutated residues Asp-927 and Gln-987 is more than 70% and Asn-1128 is 49% solvent exposed. The mutation D927G involves a residue (Asp-927) placed in a 4 residues turn between two coils. In the wild-type Asp-927 connects different protein secondary structure regions through hydrogen bonds with three residues. One hydrogen bond is between the N of the peptide bond and the OD2 of Asp-947 and the other two hydrogen bonds are between the carbonyl of the peptide bond and the amidic nitrogens of Lys-930 and Glu-931. The carboxylic moiety of Asp-927 is completely solvent exposed and does not apparently make any contact with other residues.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Location of PTPÏ mutations. Spectroscopic characterization of PTPÏ wild-type and its mutants  The near-UV CD spectrum of wild-type PTPÏ shows the contribution of all aromatic residues and is characterized by two negative components centred at 280 nm and at around 298 nm accompanied by fine structure features at 275â€“280 nm (Fig. 2A). Q987K variant displays a near-UV CD spectrum almost identical to that of the wild-type as well as D927G and N1128I	 which nevertheless show a slight decrease of the dichroic activity at 275â€“280 nm. In line with the near-UV CD results	 which suggest a similar tertiary arrangement for the wild-type and all the variants	 the fluorescence emission spectra of mutants are similar to that of wild-type protein	 being all centred at the same maximum emission wavelength around 338 nm but characterized by a decreased emission fluorescence intensity (Fig. 2B). Far-UV CD spectra of all the PTPÏ mutants superimpose well with that of the wild-type and are typical of an alpha and beta protein	 showing a local minimum at around 208 nm	 a 200 nm zero intercept and a 1.13 ratio of the 208/222 bands (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that the SNP mutations had no effect on the secondary structure of the protein and suggest that	 in the native state	 the effect of the mutations are directed and localized to the mutated residue with minor modification of tertiary arrangements.  Figure 2 Figure 2 Spectroscopic properties of PTPÏ wild-type and mutants. Thermal unfolding  The thermal stability of D927G	 Q987K and N1128I was investigated by continuously monitoring the ellipticity changes at 209 nm between 10 and 72Â°C in comparison with that of wild-type (Fig. 3). The parameter chosen to compare the transition curves of PTPÏ wild-type and mutants is the melting temperature (Tm) defined as the mid point of the denaturation process calculated by plotting the first derivative of the molar ellipticity values as a function of temperature (Fig. 3	 inset). The temperature-induced ellipticity changes at 209 nm	 where the main amplitude was observed	 occur in an apparent cooperative transition for PTPÏ wild-type	 Q987K	 N1128I and D927G	 and with apparent Tm values of 43.0	42	 41.0 and 40.0Â°C	 respectively. The temperature-induced ellipticity changes for wild type and mutants are all coincident with the heat-induced increase of the photomultiplier tube voltage (PMTV) above 370 V (Fig. 3B)	 suggesting that the temperature-induced unfolding is accompanied by protein aggregation [25]. Aggregation occurred also when thermal scans were performed at a lower heating rate with a low-temperature shifts of the apparent Tm; the differences between the apparent Tm of wild type and variants were the same as those measured at higher heating rate (data not shown). The observed transitions are irreversible as indicated by the spectra measured at the end of the cooling phase that differ from those of the native proteins measured at the beginning of the thermal transitions (data not shown). Furthermore	 inspection of the cuvette at the end of the cooling phase revealed the presence of a large amount of precipitate in all the samples.  Figure 3 Figure 3 Thermal transition of PTPÏ wild-type and mutants. Temperature dependence of phosphatase activity  The temperature dependence of phosphatase activity of PTPÏ wild-type and variants was examined over the temperature range of 10â€“42Â°C (Fig. 4A). The optimal temperatures were estimated to be at 37Â°C for wild type and Q987K	 at around 33Â°C for N1128I and at 30Â°C for D927G (Fig. 4A). Notably	 at 37Â°C	 the phosphatase activity of all PTPÏ variants is significantly reduced and corresponds to 72	 54 and 20% of that of the wild-type protein for Q987K	 N1128I and D927G	 respectively. The activation energy	 Eaâ€¡	 determined by the Arrhenius equation (1) in the temperature range between 10Â°C and the optimal temperature of each protein	 corresponds to 13.88Â±0.40 kcal/mol for the wild-type and to 12.77Â±0.51	 10.73Â±0.54 and 11.38Â±0.46 kcal/mol for N1128I	 D927G and Q987K (Fig. 4B)	 respectively. This result suggests an increased flexibility of all the variants compared to the wild-type	 particularly evident for N1128I and D927G whose phosphatase activity is significantly decreased at 42Â°C. The comparison of temperature dependence of phosphatase activity with the structural thermal unfolding monitored at 209 nm clearly indicates that the D927G and N1128I variants are significantly more flexible and less thermal resistant than the wild-type.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Effect of temperature on phosphatase activity of PTPÏ wild-type and mutants. Urea-induced equilibrium unfolding transitions  PTPÏ wild-type and variants reversibly unfold in urea at 10Â°C in 20 mM TrisHCl	 pH 7.5	 containing 200 ÂµM DTT and 0.2 M NaCl. The effect of increasing urea concentrations (0â€“8 M) on the structure of PTPÏ mutants was analyzed by far-UV CD and intrinsic fluorescence emission spectroscopy and compared to the wild-type.  Incubation of PTPÏ wild-type and variants at increasing urea concentrations at 10Â°C for 30 min	 a time sufficient to reach the equilibrium	 resulted in a progressive change of the intrinsic fluorescence emission intensity and a red-shift of the maximal emission wavelength. At the end of the transition	 above 7 M urea	 the intrinsic fluorescence emission intensity is increased about 1.5 fold and the maximal fluorescence emission wavelength shifts to around 358 nm either for the wild-type and all the variants (Fig. 5). Determination of the red-shift of the intrinsic fluorescence emission was obtained by calculating the intensity averaged emission wavelength An external file that holds a picture	 illustration	 etc. Object name is pone.0032555.e001.jpg at increasing urea concentration (Fig. 6A). This parameter is an integral measurement	 negligibly influenced by the noise	 and reflects changes in both the shape and the position of the emission spectrum.  Figure 5 Figure 5 Intrinsic fluorescence emission spectra of PTPÏ wild-type and mutants. Figure 6 Figure 6 Urea-induced equilibrium unfolding of PTPÏ wild-type and mutants. The same samples used to monitor the fluorescence emission changes during the unfolding transition were used to monitor far-UV CD ellipticity (Fig. 6A). The unfolding process is fully reversible upon dilution of the denaturant	 either for the wild-type as well as for all the mutants (Fig. 6A). The urea-induced changes in intensity averaged emission wavelength An external file that holds a picture	 illustration	 etc. Object name is pone.0032555.e003.jpg and in 222 nm ellipticity of all the mutants are similar to that of the wild-type and show a sigmoidal dependence on urea concentration	 following an apparent two-state transition. However	 the transitions monitored by ellipticity changes and An external file that holds a picture	 illustration	 etc. Object name is pone.0032555.e004.jpg changes do not coincide (Fig. 6A) suggesting the possible presence of an intermediate in the transition region at approximately 4 M urea for the wild-type and for all the variants. The plot of the relative fluorescence intensity changes versus urea concentration shows a complex dependence upon increasing denaturant concentration for the wild-type and all the mutants (Fig. 6B). The data in Fig. 6B clearly indicate a non two-state unfolding process and the population of a denaturation intermediate at about the same urea concentration of the apparent denaturation midpoints observed by ellipticity and An external file that holds a picture	 illustration	 etc. Object name is pone.0032555.e005.jpg averaged changes (Fig. 6 A and B). The folding intermediate detected by relative fluorescence intensity is populated at around 4.45 M urea for wild-type and Q987K and at around 3.95 M urea for D927G and N1128I. The intrinsic fluorescence emission spectra of the folding intermediate are similar for all the proteins: the fluorescence intensity is increased of about 1.5 fold and the maximum emission wavelength is shifted from 338 to 345 nm	 with respect to the native state (Fig. 5). The hyperfluorescent intermediate of wild-type and variants retains about 35% of the 222 nm ellipticity of the native state (Fig. 6A).  The transitions monitored by relative fluorescence intensity changes (Fig. 6B) were fitted to a three-state unfolding process which yielded the thermodynamic parameters for wild-type and the variants of PTPÏ (Table 1). For the first transition	 m values are all closely similar to that of the wild-type	 suggesting a similar unfolding mechanism for all the variants; Î”G values lower than that of the wild-type are observed for N1128I and D927G	 suggesting a destabilization of the native state for these two variants	 that also show a decreased thermal stability (see Fig. 3 and and4).4). For the second transition	 that represents the unfolding of the intermediate to the denatured state	 the m values of all the proteins are lower than those of the first transition	 indicating that a larger increase in solvent-exposed surface area occur in the unfolding from the native to the intermediate state (Table 1). Notably	 Î”G values relative to the second unfolding transition for N1128I and Q987K are larger than those relative to the first transition	 suggesting a higher stability of the intermediate states	 compared to that of the wild-type.  Table 1 Table 1 Thermodynamic parameters for urea-induced unfolding equilibrium of PTPÏwild-type and mutants. The near-UV CD changes of D927G	 the most temperature sensitive variant	 upon increasing urea concentrations were monitored in comparison with wild-type (Fig. 7) to better characterize the nature of the intermediate state. The resulting data were analyzed after removal of the high-frequency noise and the low-frequency random error by a singular value decomposition algorithm (SVD) which resolved two main spectra components either for wild-type or for the mutant D927G. The most significant singular values were 2.05Ã—103 for wild-type and 1.96Ã—103 for D927G	 the second singular values were 38.2% and 40.1% of the first singular value for wild-type and D927G	 respectively. The plots of the first (V1) and of the second column (V2) of the V matrix which reflect the global change in the 250â€“320 nm region as a function of urea concentration show non-two state transition profiles comparable to the transitions monitored by intrinsic fluorescence emission intensity and confirm the accumulation of an intermediate at around 4.2 M urea (Fig. 7 B	 and C). At this denaturant concentration	 the near-UV CD spectra of wild-type and D927G significantly differ from those of the native state and are completely opposite in sign (Fig. 7A). The 298 nm negative band is lost and a positive contribution at 289 nm is present in the spectra of the intermediate state of both proteins. Furthermore	 the 280â€“260 nm region	 dominated by contribution of Phe and Tyr residues	 in D927G is less defined than the wild-type (Fig. 7A). The data clearly indicate that both the spectral components of the wild-type and D927G contribute to the urea induced transitions with the accumulation of a denaturation intermediate at the same urea concentration range observed by monitoring intrinsic fluorescence intensity (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6B).  Figure 7 Figure 7 Effect of urea on near-UV CD spectra of PTPÏ wild-type and D927G. The urea-induced unfolding transitions monitored by far-UV CD ellipticity changes are non-coincident with those monitored by fluorescence (Fig. 6) and near-UV CD (Fig. 7). To identify the number of spectral components contributing to the urea-induced ellipticity changes	 far-UV CD spectra were analysed after removal of the high-frequency noise and the low-frequency random error by SVD. The global changes in the spectral region 213â€“250 nm	 analyzed by SVD	 indicate that only two spectral components contribute to the far-UV CD spectra of wild-type and all the variants. The most significant singular values are very similar for wild-type and all the variants and range between 1.76Ã—105 and 1.67Ã—105. The second singular values are 19.8% of the first singular value for the wild-type	 16.6% for the D927G variant	 11.2% for Q987K and 8.0% for N1128I. All the other singular values are below 7.0% of the largest singular value and progressively decrease approaching to zero. The plots of the first column of the V matrix (V1)	 which reflect the global change in the 213â€“250 nm region	 as a function of urea concentration (data not shown) show sigmoidal transition profiles comparable to the transitions monitored at 222 nm for the wild-type and the variants (data not shown). Non cooperative changes of V2 at increasing denaturant are observed. Furthermore	 the reconstituted spectra of the first spectral component superimposed well with those of the sum of the first and the second spectral component (data not shown)	 indicating that only the first spectral component contributed to the urea induced transitions monitored by ellipticity at 222 nm. These results indicate an apparent two-state process for far-UV CD unfolding transitions of wild-type and variants. Thus the data have been globally fitted to a two-state model according to equation 4 with the m parameter shared between all the data sets. The free energy of unfolding	 Î”GH2O	 of wild-type and mutants obtained from the global fitting are very similar and correspond to 3.56Â±0.09	 3.63Â±0.10	 3.65Â±0.10 and 3.82Â±0.07 kcal/mol for wild-type	 N1128I	 D927G and Q987 K	 respectively	 for a shared m value of 1.06Â±0.05 kcal/mol/M. Equilibrium unfolding of PTPÏ wild-type and variants occurs via a hyperfluorescent intermediate state that cannot be detected by far-UV CD. Hence	 the thermodynamic folding intermediate may represent a conformational change which occurs in the proximity of any of the tryptophans most likely due to an increase of native state flexibility [26].  Go to: Discussion PTPÏ	 which belongs to the classical receptor type IIB family of PTP	 is one of the most frequently mutated PTP in human cancers [1]	 [24]. In this study we investigated the effect of amino acid substitution on the thermal and thermodynamic stability and on the activity	 of the membrane-proximal catalytic D1 domain of PTPÏ. Catalytically active fragments of several PTPs of type IIB family are proteolytically cleaved and released within the cytoplasm of tumour cells [27]â€“[29]	 hence the biophysical characterization of this catalytic domain may be relevant. The D1 domain is a monomeric	 structurally independent and stable folding unit characterized by a high thermodynamic stability. In this study	 we selected PTPÏ mutations of D1 domain found in colorectal cancers [10] and reported in nsSNP database [14]	 D927G	 Q987K	 A1118P and N1128I. All the mutants are expressed as soluble recombinant proteins	 except A1118P which remains insoluble also upon different growth and induction conditions. The spectroscopic properties of the wild-type compared with those of all the variants indicate that the mutations D927G	 Q987K and N1128I had no effect on protein secondary structure with minor modifications of tertiary arrangements.  All the mutants show a decrease in the thermal stability and in the activation energy for phosphatase activity with respect to the wild-type indicating an increase in protein flexibility of all the mutants. Hence	 at 37Â°C the phosphatase activity of all the variants was significantly reduced	 similarly to what reported by Wang et al. for Q987K and N1128I [10]. The most destabilizing mutation	 D927G	 yielded a protein that at physiological temperature was almost completely inactive.  All the mutations studied here are located at very diverse positions in the structure	 distant from the catalytic site and	 except A1118P	 in solvent-exposed loop regions. Presumably	 the change in main chain flexibility caused by the most destabilizing D927G mutation may lead to local disorder and may affect the stabilizing hydrogen bonds of residues in close proximity (Asp-947	 Lys-930 and Glu-931). This hypothesis is in agreement with the changes in local environment of aromatic residues suggested by the comparison of the near-UV CD spectrum of D927G with that of the wild-type. The N1128I mutation is less destabilizing than D927G. In the wild-type structure N1128	 about 50% solvent accessible	 is located in a very polar environment at the C-terminus of helix 8 and is involved	 through its peptidic nitrogen	 in a hydrogen bond with the peptide carbonyl of Asp-1124. The susbtitution of a polar residue	 Asn-1128	 to a nonpolar residue	 Ile	 may also contribute to destabilize the N1128I mutant. Q987K is the least destabilizing mutation with regard to thermal stability and temperature dependence of phosphatase activity	 probably due to the fact that Gln-987 in the wild-type structure is not involved in any interaction with other protein residues.  All the variants	 as revealed by intrinsic fluorescence emission intensity	 show three-state equilibrium unfolding transitions similar to that of the wild-type	 with the accumulation of a hyperfluorescent intermediate at âˆ¼4.0 M urea that retains 35% of the native secondary structure ellipticity. The hyperfluorescent intermediate of wild-type and of D927G	 the most temperature sensitive variant	 contains tertiary contacts	 although the packing of aromatic side-chains appears different from that of the native state.  The reversibility of the urea-induced unfolding equilibrium at low temperature allows a quantitative determination of the effect of mutations on the thermodynamic parameters of PTPÏ catalytic domain. The destabilizing effect of mutations caused by nsSNPs on PTPÏ thermodynamic stability (Table 1) may be referred i) to a destabilization of the native state for N1128I and D927G	 as indicated by the values of Î”GH2OI-N lower than that of the wild-type	 and ii) to a stabilization of the intermediate for all the variants	 as suggested by the higher free energy of unfolding from the intermediate to the unfolded state (Î”GH2OU-I)	 with respect to that of the wild-type (Table 1). The destabilizing effect of D927G and N1128I substitutions is also evident from the decrease in melting temperature monitored by secondary structure changes and from the significant reduction of phosphatase activity at 37Â°C that suggests a higher flexibility of the two variants with respect to the wild-type.  The reversible equilibrium unfolding transitions monitored by far-UV CD are not coincident with those monitored by near-UV CD and intrinsic fluorescence emission intensity and do not reveal any denaturation intermediate. The thermodynamic parameters relative to the apparent two-state equilibrium unfolding measured by far-UV CD do not indicate any significant difference between the variants and the wild-type and are lower than those determined by intrinsic fluorescence emission intensity. In particular	 the shared m value of 1.06 kcal/mol/M calculated from global fitting of the far-UV CD equilibrium unfolding data is significantly lower than the predicted m value for a monomeric protein of 280 amino acid residues unfolded in urea which is 3.71Â±0.3 kcal/mol/M [30]	 a value closely similar to that measured by fluorescence intensity. As a matter of fact	 fluorescence intensity is extremely sensitive to the microenvironment of a fluorophore and is considered as the most straightforward signal that can be related to thermodynamics of unfolding transitions [31]. The discrepancy between the thermodynamic parameters obtained by far-UV CD and fluorescence intensity and the lack of a detectable intermediate by far-UV CD may indicate that the hyperfluorescent intermediate state represents conformational changes which occur in the proximity of any of the tryptophans	 with an alternative tertiary arrangement. In the native state	 the maximum emission wavelength (Î»maxâ€Š=â€Š338 nm) indicate that tryptophan residues are shielded from the solvent	 whereas a partial exposure of tryptophan residues to the solvent is observed for the intermediate (Î»maxâ€Š=â€Š345 nm). These results are in agreement with the structural data which indicate that in PTPÏ two out of the five tryptophans	 Trp-994 and Trp-998	 are located in the same helical region (helix 6) and Trp-926	 Trp-1023 and Trp-1072 are placed in coil regions. All the five tryptophans are almost completely buried. In the native state the solvent accessibility of the five chromophores is 15% for Trp-998	 14% for Trp-926 and 4% for Trp-1023	 whereas all the other tryptophan residues are completely buried. Hence	 at approximately 4.0 M urea	 it is impossible to assign to any of the five chromophores a particular role in the fluorescence properties of the intermediate state.  In conclusion our results revealed a destabilizing and inactivating role of the mutations of PTPÏ D1 domain found in colorectal cancers [10]. All the amino acid mutations studied here are on the surface of PTPÏ and could potentially participate in protein-protein interactions. The stabilization of a folding intermediate	 coincident with an alternative tertiary arrangement	 may play a role in recognition and interaction with other substrate proteins as well as in sensitivity of this phosphatase to degradation.  																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	
1	64||The receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase T (PTPRT/PTPÏ) is the most frequently mutated tyrosine phosphatase in human cancer. PTPÏ mediates homophilic cell-cell aggregation. In its extracellular region	 PTPÏ has cell adhesion molecule-like motifs	 including a MAM domain	 an immunoglobulin domain and four fibronectin type III (FNIII) repeats. Tumor-derived mutations have been identified in all of these extracellular domains. Previously	 we determined that tumor-derived mutations in the MAM and immunoglobulin domains of PTPÏ reduce homophilic cell-cell aggregation. In this manuscript	 we describe experiments in which we evaluated the contribution of the FNIII repeats to PTPÏ-mediated cell-cell adhesion. Our results demonstrate that deletion of the FNIII repeats of PTPÏ result in defective cell-cell aggregation. Furthermore	 all of the tumor-derived mutations in the FNIII repeats of PTPÏ also disrupt cell-cell aggregation. These results further support the hypothesis that mutational inactivation of PTPÏ may lead to cancer progression by disrupting cell-cell adhesion.  Keywords: Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase	 PTPRT	 PTPÏ	 fibronectin type III repeat	 cell-cell aggregation	 cell-cell adhesion Go to: 1. Introduction Cancer progression and metastasis is in part influenced by changes in cell adhesion and tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) (Paschos et al. 2009; Wheelock et al. 2008)	 as well as tyrosine kinases and tyrosine phosphatases	 respectively (Freiss and Vignon 2004; Ostman et al. 2006). Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) comprise a family of proteins that have extracellular CAM domains coupled to cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatase domains	 and thus can impact cancer progression by regulating both cell adhesion and tyrosine phosphorylation (Brady-Kalnay 2001; Ostman et al. 2006).  The type IIB PTPÎ¼-like subfamily of RPTPs includes PTPÎ¼	 PTPÏ	 PTPÎº	 and PCP-2 (PTPÎ») (Aricescu et al. 2008; Brady-Kalnay 2001). The extracellular segment of the PTPÎ¼-like RPTPs contain motifs found in CAMs	 including a MAM domain	 an immunoglobulin (Ig) domain and four fibronectin type III (FNIII) repeats (Aricescu et al. 2008; Brady-Kalnay 2001; Ostman et al. 2006). PTPÎ¼ subfamily members bind homophilically (i.e. the â€œligandâ€ for PTPÎ¼ is an identical PTPÎ¼ molecule on an adjacent cell) (Brady-Kalnay et al. 1993; Cheng et al. 1997; Gebbink et al. 1993; Sap et al. 1994; Yu et al. 2008; Zondag et al. 1995). The Ig domain of PTPÎ¼ is responsible for promoting homophilic interactions (Brady-Kalnay and Tonks 1994)	 and proper cell surface localization (Del Vecchio and Tonks 2005). However	 both the MAM and Ig domains as well as the first two FNIII repeats are required for efficient cell-cell adhesion of PTPÎ¼ (Aricescu et al. 2006; Aricescu et al. 2007; Aricescu et al. 2008; Brady-Kalnay and Tonks 1994; Cismasiu et al. 2004; Zondag et al. 1995). PTPÏ and PTPÎº also mediate homophilic cell-cell adhesion (Sap et al. 1994; Yu et al. 2008). However	 PCP2 has not yet been demonstrated to mediate cell-cell adhesion or aggregation although in vitro binding studies indicate it can bind homophilically (Cheng et al. 1997).  All type IIB RPTPs are potential tumor suppressor genes (Burgoyne et al. 2009a; Flavell et al. 2008; McArdle et al. 2001; Yan et al. 2006). Notably	 PTPÏ is the most frequently mutated phosphatase gene in human cancers including colon	 lung	 skin and stomach cancers (Forbes et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2004). Defective adhesion mediated by PTPÏ may be at least one mechanism of cancer progression. In fact	 cancer derived mutations in the MAM and Ig domains of PTPÏ are defective in mediating cell-cell aggregation (Yu et al. 2008).  In addition to the tumor-derived mutations in the MAM and Ig domains of PTPÏ previously described (Wang et al. 2004; Yu et al. 2008)	 the majority of extracellular domain mutations are located in the FNIII repeats of PTPÏ (Wang et al. 2004). Given the importance of FNIII repeats in PTPÎ¼-mediated adhesion and aggregation (Aricescu et al. 2007)	 we tested the contribution of the FNIII repeats of PTPÏ to PTPÏ-mediated adhesion. We determined that deletion constructs where each of the extracellular domains of PTPÏ is removed	 including the FNIII repeats	 are defective in mediating cell-cell aggregation of Sf9 cells. Furthermore	 when we engineered the cancer-derived mutations in the FNIII repeats of these PTPÏ mutant proteins	 they also result in defective cell-cell aggregation. These results demonstrate the importance of the FNIII repeats in contributing to proper cell-cell adhesion and suggest that adhesion mediated by PTPÏ is likely important for the tumor suppressor activity of PTPÏ.

Materials and methods 2.1 Baculovirus generation  Baculoviruses were generated by transfecting cells with the BaculoGoldâ„¢ Linearized Baculovirus DNA (BD Biosciences	 San Diego	 CA) according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. The baculovirus for wild-type PTPÏ was previously described (Yu et al. 2008).  2.2 Sf9 cell culture  Insect Sf9 cells from (BD Biosciences) were maintained at 27Â°C in Graces Insect Medium (BD Biosciences). The medium was supplemented with 10% FBS from (Hyclone	 Logan	 UT) and Gentamicin (MP Biomedicals	 Solon	 OH). Viruses were added to Sf9 cell medium to induce the expression of proteins of interest. Cells were harvested 30 hours post-infection for further analysis.  2.3 Generation of PTPRT deletion constructs  The PTPÏ-Î”MAM	 PTPÏ-Î”Ig	 PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-1	 PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-2	 PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-3 and PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-4 constructs were generated by fusion PCR using the full-length PTPRT pVL1393-V5-His vector as the template. The primers 5â€™-GAAGATCTATGGCGAGCCTCGCCGCG-3â€™ and 5â€™-CCGGAATTCGGATCCTGGGGCGCTCTGAGCCCGGG-3â€™ were used to generate the PTPÏ-Î”MAM construct; the primers 5â€™-GCGTGGGAGGCTCTCTGCATGGATGAGCAAGGAC-3â€™ and 5â€™-CAATGGGTCTTGCTCATCCATGCAGAGAGCCTCCCACGCCCATTG-3â€™ were used to generate the PTPÏ-Î”Ig construct; the primers 5â€™-CTGCACACTTGGTCCTGGTTTTCACGATCAGCTCCGCGTA-3â€™ and 5â€™-TACGCGGAGCGTCGTGAAAACCAGGACCAAGTGTGCAG-3â€™ were used to generate the PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-1 construct; the primers 5â€™-CCGCCAGGGCCTCCCCTCACCGAGGAAGACGTTCCAGGAG-3â€™ and 5â€™-CTCCTGGAACGTCTTCCTCGGTGAGGGGAGGCCCTGGCGG-3â€™ were used to generate the PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-2 construct; the primers 5â€™-GAGGAGCTGGTGGTGCAGACTAAAATTTCAGCTCCATCCA-3â€™ and 5â€™-TGGATGGAGCTGAAATTTTAGTCTGCACCACCAGCTCCTC-3â€™ were used to generate the PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-3 construct and the 5â€™-GTCACCACTCGGATTGCCACCGGTGCCTCCACCCAGAATT-3â€™ and 5â€™-AATTCTGGGTGGAGGCACCGGTGGCAATCCGAGTGGTGAC-3â€™ were used to generate the PTPÏ-Î”FNIII-4 construct.  2.4 Immunoblotting  Sf9 cells were lysed in a standard lysis buffer (20 mM TrisÂ·HCl	 pH 7.5	 1% Triton X-100	 150 mM sodium chloride	 2 mM Benzamidine	 2.5Î¼g/ml Aprotinin	 2.5Î¼g/ml Leupeptin	 and 0.5Î¼g/ml Pepstatin). Samples were solubilized in 2X SDS loading buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Samples were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman	 Piscataway	 NJ) and immunoblotted with SK18 (Brady-Kalnay et al. 1993)	 which cross-reacts with PTPÏ.  2.5 Cell surface expression of PTPÏ  Cell surface expression of PTPÏ protein in baculovirus infected Sf9 cells was determined using a modified biotin-avidin reaction with the Cell Surface Protein Isolation Kit (catalog# 89991	 Pierce	 Rockford	 IL)	 as previously described (Yu et al. 2008). Briefly	 Sf9 cell media was removed and the flasks were incubated with rocking for 30 minutes at 4Â°C in 5ml of 0.25mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin in 1X PBS. The cells were mechanically removed from the flask	 centrifuged	 washed	 and lysed according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocols. To isolate cell surface expressed PTPÏ the cell lysate was added to a NeutrAvidin Gel column and incubated for 60 min at room temperature (RT) with rocking prior to washing and eluting proteins with 200Î¼l of sample buffer containing a final concentration of 55mM DTT for 60min at RT. The flow through was run on 6% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Total cell surface protein levels were normalized by immunoblotting cell lysates with an anti-actin antibody (JLA20). The normalized cell surface protein was run on 6% SDS-PAGE gels	 transferred to nitrocellulose and immunoblotted with antibodies to PTPÎ¼ that also recognized PTPÏ (SK18) followed by secondary antibody conjugated to HRP. The HRP signal was detected using a Fluor-S MAX MultiImager (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.	 Hercules	 CA).  2.6 Aggregation Assays  Sf9 cells were harvested by trituration. The cell suspensions were added to glass scintillation vials and incubated at 27Â°C at 90 rpm in a gyratory shaker for 30 minutes. For a given condition	 the cell suspension was transferred to a 100mm petri dish either prior to (0 time point) or 30 minutes after aggregation. Images were captured at 10X magnification with a Nikon TE-200 inverted fluorescent microscope (Tokyo	 Japan). To quantify cell aggregates	 pictures of four randomly selected fields were taken per dish. The area of each object (single cells and aggregates) was determined by the Metamorph software (Molecular Devices) using an auto-threshold setting for light objects and appropriate size filters that allowed the counting of cells and aggregates but not debris. The four replicates were combined to yield average readings per condition. The percent aggregation was then calculated as the average aggregate area at 30 minutes minus the average aggregate area at zero minutes divided by the average aggregate area at 30 minutes [(N30-N0)/N30]. A minimum of three independent experiments was performed per condition. Statistical significance was determined in Microsoft Excel using Studentâ€™s T-test. Error bars indicate standard error.  2.7 Site-directed mutagenesis  The I395V	 Y412F	 R453C	 Q479E	 S492F	 N510K	 T605M	 V648G	 A707T	 and L708P tumor-derived mutations (Wang et al. 2004) were generated by fusion PCR using the full-length PTPRT pVL1393-V5-His vector as the template. The primers 5â€™-TGGCCCACAGAACGTGGAAGTCGTAGACATCAGAGCC-3â€™ and 5â€™-CTTCCACGTTCTGTGGGCCA-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the I395V mutant; the primers 5â€™-CAGTGGGAGCCCTTCGGCTTCGCGGTGACCCGCTGCCAT-3â€™ and 5â€™-AAGCCGAAGGGCTCCCACTG-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the Y412F mutant; the primers 5â€™-CTACACCCTGCGAGGCCTGTGCCCCTTCATGACCATCCG-3â€™ and 5â€™-ACAGGCCTCGCAGGGTGTAG-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the R453C mutant; the primers 5â€™-GAGCGAGGAGCTGGTGGTGGAGACTGAGGAAGACGTTCC-3â€™ and 5â€™-CCACCACCAGCTCCTCGCTC-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the Q479E mutant; the primers 5â€™-TGTTCCTCTAGAATTCATCCAAGGGGGGCCCT TT-3â€™ and 5â€™-ATGAATTCTAGAGGAACA-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the S492F mutant; the primers 5â€™-TCCAGTGGAAACCTCCCAAGGAGACCAATGGGGTCATCA-3â€™ and 5â€™-CTTGGGAGGTTTCCACTGGA-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the N510K mutant; the primers 5â€™-CCATTGAATGAGACAGACATGACC ATCACAGTGATGCTG3-â€™ and 5â€™-ATGTCTGTCTCATTCAATGG-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the T605M mutant; the primers 5â€™-ATTATTGAGTGCTTTTC GGGGCCCGTGAGCTATCGGAAT-3â€™ and 5â€™-CCCGAAAAGCACTCAATAAT-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the V648G mutant; the primers 5â€™-CTACAGCATCTACTTCCAGACACTCAGCAAAGCCAATGG-3â€™ and 5â€™-TCTGGAAGTAGATGCTGTAG-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the A707T mutant; the primers 5â€™-AGCATCTACTTCCAGGCACCCAGCAAAGCCAATGGAGAG-3â€™ and 5â€™-GGTGCCTGGAAGTAGATGCT-3â€™ were used as the mutagenic primers for the L708P mutant.  2.8 Mapping of PTPÏ mutations onto the PTPÎ¼ crystal structure  The sequence of PTPÎ¼ and PTPÏ were aligned using CLUSTALW. Mutations probed in this study were mapped using this sequence alignment onto the PTPÎ¼ structure (PDB ID: 2V5Y). The figure was prepared utilizing PyMOL 1.2r1 (http://pymol.org).  Go to: 3. Results 3.1 Deletions in the MAM	 Ig	 and FNIII repeat domains of PTPÏ result in defective cell-cell aggregation  To test whether a protein mediates cell-cell aggregation or adhesion	 one has to express the protein of interest in the non-adhesive cells. Otherwise	 one cannot measure the aggregation or adhesion of a single molecule in the sea of other adhesion molecules naturally expressed in adhesive cells. This is the main reason that the non-adhesive Sf9 or Drosophila S2 cells are widely used models for such studies. To our knowledge	 nearly all cell lines of epithelial origin are adhesive cells and thus are not suitable for these studies. Introduction of putative adhesion molecules into non-adhesive Drosophila S2 insect cells has been used to demonstrate adhesive functions for fasciclin II	 connectin	 Dtrk	 ARK	 Neuroglian	 and Capricious molecules directly (Bellosta et al. 1995; Hortsch et al. 1995; Nose et al. 1992; Pulido et al. 1992; Shinza-Kameda et al. 2006; Snow et al. 1989). In a similar approach	 we and others demonstrated that the full-length form of PTPÎ¼ induced aggregation	 via a homophilic binding mechanism	 when expressed in nonadhesive Sf9 insect cells	 which are derived from the Fall army-worm Spodoptera frugiperda (Brady-Kalnay et al. 1993; Gebbink et al. 1993; Zondag et al. 1995). We have also used this system for analyzing PTPRT/PTP rho (Yu et al.	 2008). Examples of other cell adhesion molecules that have been studied in Sf9 cells include L1 (Gouveia et al. 2008)	 Galectin-3 (Inohara and Raz 1995) and C-CAM1 (Phan et al. 2001). Insect S2 and Sf9 cells are extremely useful systems to analyze adhesive mechanisms of cell adhesion molecules.  The MAM domain	 Ig domain	 and first two-FNIII repeats are essential for PTPÎ¼ cell-cell aggregation (Brady-Kalnay and Tonks 1994; Zondag et al. 1995). To test whether these domains are the minimal essential regions required for PTPÏ cell-cell aggregation	 baculoviral PTPÏ deletion constructs of the MAM domain	 Ig domain	 and each of the four individual FNIII repeats were made and expressed in non-adhesive Sf9 insect cells (Figure 1). All the PTPÏ deletion constructs were expressed and appropriately trafficked to the cell surface (Figure 1). To test whether these domains contribute to PTPÏ-dependent adhesion	 Sf9 cells were evaluated for their ability to mediate cell-cell aggregation when expressing the deletion constructs. Aggregation assays with Sf9 cells expressing the deletion constructs were conducted alongside aggregation assays using Sf9 cells expressing wild-type PTPÏ	 which mediates cell-cell aggregation (Figure 2) and serves as a positive control (Yu et al. 2008). Deletion of any of the extracellular domains of PTPÏ resulted in defective cell-cell aggregation compared to aggregation of wild-type PTPÏ expressing Sf9 cells (Figure 2). Deletion of the fourth FNIII repeat was the least severe where ~23% aggregation was observed. Deletion of the MAM domain	 Ig domain and FNIII repeats 1	 2 or 3 resulted in 5â€“16% aggregation. When the level of aggregation was quantified	 we determined that all of the deletion constructs resulted in a large and statistically significant reduction in cell-cell aggregation (Figure 2	 p-value<0.005). Together with our previous study	 these results demonstrate that all of the extracellular domains of PTPÏ are necessary for PTPÏ-mediated cell-cell aggregation.  Figure 1 Figure 1 PTPÏ deletion constructs are all expressed at the cell surface. Constructs containing deletions of one extracellular domain of PTPÏ each were generated and expressed in Sf9 cells. Total cellular protein and cell surface protein were isolated ... Figure 2 Figure 2 Deletion of any of the extracellular domains of PTPÏ disrupts cell-cell aggregation. Sf9 cells expressing deletion constructs of the individual extracellular domains of PTPÏ were allowed to aggregate for 30 minutes prior to imaging. Scale ... 3.2 Tumor-Derived PTPÏ Mutations in the FNIII repeats result in defective cell-cell aggregation  We next tested the effects of human tumor-derived mutations in the FNIII repeats of PTPÏ on PTPÏ-mediated cell-cell aggregation. We recently demonstrated that tumor-derived mutations in the MAM and Ig domains of PTPÏ are defective in cell-cell aggregation using the Sf9 aggregation assay (Yu et al. 2008)	 and given the above results	 we hypothesized that mutations in the FNIII domains would likewise result in defective aggregation. Ten human tumor-derived mutations are located in the second	 third and fourth FNIII repeats of PTPÏ (Wang et al. 2004). To test whether these mutations also affect cell-cell aggregation	 we engineered the ten human mutations by site-directed mutagenesis using the full-length PTPÏ baculoviral construct as a template (see Figure 3). The ten mutations are expressed in Sf9 cells at the expected molecular weight and at similar levels to full-length human PTPÏ (Figure 3). All of these mutants are expressed at the cell surface (Figure 3). When these mutant PTPÏ proteins were expressed in Sf9 cells and tested in aggregation assays	 we observed that all of the mutant PTPÏ proteins resulted in fewer and smaller aggregates than wild type PTPÏ (Figure 4). When the level of aggregation was quantified	 we determined that all of the FNIII mutations significantly reduced cell-cell aggregation (16â€“43%) compared to cells expressing wild type PTPÏ (68% aggregation	 p-value<0.008	 Figure 4).  Figure 3 Figure 3 PTPÏ proteins containing tumor-derived mutations in their FNIII domains are expressed at the cell surface. Ten mutations in the FNIII domains of PTPÏ were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in Sf9 cells. Total cellular ...

Discussion PTPRT/PTPÏ is the most highly mutated tyrosine phosphatase in human colon carcinomas. We and others found that PTPRT/ PTPÏ is also mutated in lung	 gastric and skin (melanoma) cancers (Forbes et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2004). The spectrum of mutations	 which included nonsense mutations and frameshifts	 suggested that these mutations were inactivating (Wang et al. 2004). Biochemical analyses demonstrated that missense mutations in the catalytic domains of PTPRT diminished its phosphatase activity and overexpression of PTPRT inhibited colon cancer cell growth. Moreover	 we showed previously that the tumor-derived mutations in the MAM and Ig domains of PTPÏ are defective in cell-cell adhesion (Yu et al. 2008). All these data suggest that PTPRT/PTPÏ normally functions as a tumor suppressor gene. The experiments presented in this manuscript evaluate the contribution of the individual extracellular domains of PTPÏ to PTPÏ-mediated adhesion. We demonstrate that in addition to the MAM and Ig domains	 the FNIII repeats are required for PTPÏ-mediated adhesion. Importantly	 we also show that PTPÏ-mediated adhesion is impaired by human tumor-derived mutations in those FNIII repeats. These studies indicate that all the tumor-derived mutations located in the extracellular domain of PTPRT are loss-of-function mutations	 thereby providing further evidence that PTPRT is a tumor suppressor. This notion is further supported by our recent study showing that PTPRT knockout mice are highly susceptible to colon specific carcinogen azoxymethane (AOM)-induced colon cancer (Zhao et al.).  PTPÎ¼-mediated cell-cell aggregation requires the MAM domain	 Ig domain	 and the first two FNIII repeats (Aricescu et al. 2006; Aricescu et al. 2007; Brady-Kalnay and Tonks 1994; Cismasiu et al. 2004; Zondag et al. 1995). The entire extracellular domain of PTPÎ¼ is predicted to make a rigid conformation with extensive interfaces between each of the domains (Aricescu et al. 2006). The minimal adhesive unit for functional cell-cell aggregation is the MAM domain	 Ig domain and the first two FNIII repeats (Aricescu et al. 2006; Brady-Kalnay and Tonks 1994; Zondag et al. 1995). However	 the FNIII repeats appear to play a role in spacing the key homophilic interaction domain(s) a certain distance from the plasma membrane. Deletion of the FNIII repeats changed the intercellular spacing of two apposing membranes (Aricescu et al. 2007). Cell-cell aggregation assays of the FNIII deletion constructs were not performed in that study (Aricescu et al. 2007). The amino acid residues of the interfaces between the extracellular domains are highly conserved between members of the type IIB RPTP subfamily (Aricescu et al. 2006; Aricescu et al. 2007) therefore it is likely that the PTPÏ adhesive interface resembles that of PTPÎ¼. Together our data support the hypothesis that the essential regions for PTPÏ-mediated adhesion resemble those of PTPÎ¼.  To gain insight into how the point mutations may alter the adhesive function of PTPÏ	 we modeled the human tumor derived PTPÏ mutations onto the crystal structure of PTPÎ¼ (Figure 5). The crystal structure of PTPÎ¼ includes only the first three FNIII repeats (Aricescu et al. 2007). Four of these mutations fall within the second FNIII (FNIII-2) repeat (I395V	 Y412F	 R453C	 Q479E). It is important to note that FNIII-2 is required for efficient cell-cell adhesion (Aricescu et al. 2006). Two of the mutations fall in the third FNIII (FNIII-3) repeat (S492F	 N510K). The mutation within the linker region between FNIII-1 and FNII-2 (Y412F) could alter the flexibility or positioning between the two domains. The other mutations (I395V R453C	 Q479E	 S492F	 N510K) appear to be clustered in surface exposed regions and/or near the linker regions between FNIII-2 and FNIII-3 that could alter flexibility	 position of individual FNIII repeats and/or protein-protein interactions. While these mutations do not correspond to the adhesive interface hypothesized for PTPÎ¼ based upon a single static crystal structure (Aricescu et al. 2007)	 some of the mutations fall within the FNIII-2 repeat which is required for adhesion	 and all of these surface modifications would likely alter either the three-dimensional topology and/or cis/trans interactions of PTPÏ.  Figure 5 Figure 5 Structural modeling of the point mutations of PTPÏ. The point mutations (indicated in red) evaluated in this manuscript were modeled onto the equivalent sites in the crystal structure of PTPÎ¼. The PTPÏ mutations likely alter cell-cell ... Other type IIB RPTPs also function as tumor suppressor genes	 by regulating adhesion and/or tyrosine phosphorylation of effector proteins. Expression of PTPÎ¼ is reduced in human glioblastomas (GBM) and cell lines (Burgoyne et al. 2009a). Reduction in full-length PTPÎ¼ expression with a concomitant increase in a proteolytically processed cytoplasmic fragment of PTPÎ¼ is observed in GBM cells and both are correlated with decreased adhesion and increased migration observed in the disease (Burgoyne et al. 2009a; Burgoyne et al. 2009b). Over-expression of the full-length form of PTPÎ¼ suppressed migration of GBM cells and reduces their survival (Burgoyne et al. 2009b). Of note	 at the same time that stable cell adhesion is reduced due to the loss of full-length PTPÎ¼ expression in GBM cells	 a catalytically active cytoplasmic fragment of PTPÎ¼ is released and translocates to the nucleus (Burgoyne et al. 2009b). Catalytic activity of this fragment is also necessary for cell migration and viability of GBM cells (Burgoyne et al. 2009b). Therefore	 both the tyrosine phosphatase activity of the cytoplasmic fragment of PTPÎ¼ and the loss of PTPÎ¼-mediated adhesion may contribute to the invasiveness of GBM cells.  PTPÎº is also implicated in tumor progression. PTPÎº expression is reduced in melanoma cell lines and human tissue biopsies (McArdle et al. 2001)	 and in Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma cells (Flavell et al. 2008). Over-expression of PTPÎº in Hodgkin lymphoma cells reduces cellular proliferation and survival (Flavell et al. 2008). Like PTPÎ¼	 PTPÎº is proteolytically processed (Anders et al. 2006)	 potentially as a result of aberrant glycosylation (Kim et al. 2006). It is not clear whether adhesion or catalytic activity of PTPÎº is required for its tumor suppressor activity (Flavell et al. 2008; Kim et al. 2006). Of note	 the cleaved cytoplasmic domain fragment of PTPÎº is catalytically active	 translocates to the nucleus and promotes Î²-catenin-mediated transcription (Anders et al. 2006). Signaling via the PTPÎº cytoplasmic fragment might augment the loss of stable cell-cell adhesion and may promote tumor progression.  Although speculative	 it is interesting to postulate that tyrosine phosphatase activity and or cleavage of PTPÏ will also be an important element of its tumor suppressor activity	 as has been demonstrated for PTPÎ¼ and PTPÎº. Interestingly	 we identified and validated STAT3 as a direct substrate of PTPRT (Zhang et al. 2007). STAT3 is latent transcription factor that translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus after being phosphorylated at the Y705 residue. It is possible that the cleaved intracellular fragment of PTPÏ	 which contains the phosphatase domains	 translocates to nucleus and dephosphorylates STAT3. Besco and colleagues found that PTPRT associates with the adhesion molecule E-cadherin and its binding partner p120 catenin	 which are PTPRT substrates (Besco et al. 2006). p120 also translocates to the nucleus and associates with the Kaiso transcription factor (Daniel and Reynolds 1999). Given the frequency and distribution of mutations in PTPRT/PTPÏ in human colon and other cancers	 a more thorough understanding of its biological function is warranted. 																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	65||Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase T (PTPRT/PTPÏ) is frequently mutated in human cancers including colon	 lung	 gastric and skin cancers. More than half of the identified tumor-derived mutations are located in the extracellular part of PTPÏ. However	 the functional significance of those extracellular domain mutations remains to be defined. Here we report that the extracellular domain of PTPÏ mediates homophilic cell-cell aggregation. This homophilic interaction is very specific	 as PTPÏ does not interact with its closest homolog PTPÎ¼ in a cell aggregation assay. We further demonstrated that all 5 tumor-derived mutations located in the N-terminal MAM and Ig domains impair	 to varying extents	 their ability to from cell aggregates	 indicating that those mutations are loss-of-function mutations. Our results suggest that PTPÏ may play an important role in cell-cell adhesion and mutational inactivation of this phosphatase could promote tumor migration and metastasis.  Go to: Introduction Tyrosine phosphorylation is coordinately controlled by protein tyrosine kinases and phosphatases and is a central feature of many signaling pathways involved in tumor development (1). While activating mutations in protein tyrosine kinases have been shown to play vital roles in tumorigenesis (1)	 the role of phosphatases is less well-defined. We recently identified PTPRT	 also known as PTPÏ	 as the most frequently mutated PTP gene in colorectal cancers (CRCs) (2). PTPRT was also mutationally altered in lung	 gastric cancers and melanomas (2). The spectrum of mutations	 which included nonsense mutations and frameshifts	 suggested that these mutations were inactivating (2). Biochemical analyses demonstrated that missense mutations in the catalytic domains of PTPÏ diminished its phosphatase activity and overexpression of PTPÏ inhibited CRC cell growth (2). Taken together	 these studies strongly supported the notion that PTPÏ normally acts as a tumor suppressor gene. This conclusion was also supported by a transposon-based somatic mutagenesis screen in mice	 wherein PTPÏ was isolated as a target gene from two different mouse transgenic sarcomas (3).  PTPRT (PTPÏ) is a member of the type IIB receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) subfamily (4). Other members of this subfamily include PTPRM (PTPÎ¼)	 PTPRK (PTPÎº) and PCP2 (also called PTPÎ»	 PTPÏˆ	 PTPRO-omicron	 PTPÏ€	 hPTP-J) (5). These 4 RPTPs share the same domain structure: an extracelluar domain	 a juxtamembrane region and two phosphatase domains (6). The extracellular domains of type IIB RPTPs have high sequence identities (7	 8)	 all consist of a MAM (memprin/A5/PTPÎ¼) domain	 an Ig domain	 and four fibronectin type III (FNIII) repeats (6). The MAM domain is suggested to play a role in protein dimerization (6). The Ig domain is a disulfide structure that is found in many cell surface proteins and has been shown to mediate homophilic and heterophilic interactions between cell adhesion molecules (6). The FNIII motif was originally identified in the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin and later found to be present in many immunoglobulin superfamily cell adhesion molecules (6). We have identified ~15 somatic mutations that are localized in the extracellular domain of PTPRT/PTPÏ. How these mutations affect the functions of PTPÏ remains to be determined.  Three close homologs of PTPÏ	 PTPÎ¼	 PTPÎº and PTPÎ» (PCP-2)	 are known to mediate homophilic cell-cell adhesion (9â€“ 12). Expression of the full-length PTPÎ¼ (9) (10) or a construct encoding the extracellular	 transmembrane and 55 amino acids of the juxtamembrane domain of PTPÎ¼ in non-adhesive Sf9 insect cells induces cell aggregation (9). Furthermore	 homophilic binding of PTPÎ¼ was demonstrated between PTPÎ¼-coated fluorescent beads and cells that endogenously express PTPÎ¼ (9). The minimal region required for homophilic binding was mapped to the Ig domain of PTPÎ¼ (13). In addition	 the Ig domain is required for proper cell surface localization (14). However	 assays that test cell-cell aggregation demonstrate that the MAM and Ig domains as well as the first two fibronectin type III repeats are required for efficient cell-cell aggregation (15â€“ 18). Similarly	 PTPÎº was also demonstrated to mediate homophilic cell-cell aggregation (11). Here we report that PTPRT (PTPÏ)	 like its homologs	 mediates homophilic cell-cell aggregation in Sf9 cells. Most importantly	 the tumor-derived mutations located in the MAM and Ig domains are defective in this cell-cell adhesion function.  Go to: Results The extracellular domain of PTPÏ mediates cell-cell aggregation in Sf9 cells  To test whether PTPÏ mediates homophilic cell-cell adhesion	 we made the following PTPÏ baculoviral constructs expressing: (1) full-length PTPÏ; (2) the intracellular fragment of PTPÏ (Intra); (3) the extracellular fragment of PTPÏ with its transmembrane domain (Extra-TM); (4) the extracellular fragment of PTPÏ with its transmembrane	 juxtamembrane and wedge domains (Extra-JMD-W); (5) a chimera containing the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the EGF receptor and the intracellular PTP domains of PTPÏ (Fig. 1A). All of those fragments were tagged with V5 epitope tags. Proteins of the expected size were expressed in Sf9 cells infected with those baculoviral constructs (Fig. 1B). All of these proteins	 but the intracellular PTPÏ	 were expressed on the surface on Sf9 cells (Fig. 1C). To test whether these PTPÏ recombinant proteins mediate cell-cell adhesion	 a cell aggregation assay was performed following the procedure of Brady-Kalnay et al (9). Sf9 cells infected with a baculovirus encoding PTPÎ¼	 which was previously demonstrated to mediate cell-cell aggregation	 were treated in parallel as a positive control (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig 2	 the non-adhesive Sf9 cells expressing either the full-length PTPÏ or PTPÏ-JMD-W formed cell aggregates. On the contrary	 Sf9 cells expressing either the intracellular fragments of PTPÏ or the EGFR/PTPÏ chimeras remained as a suspension of single cells (Fig 1C). These results indicate that the extracullar fragment of PTPÏ play an important role in mediating cell-cell aggregation and the phosphatase activity of PTPÏ is not required for this function. Surprisingly	 although the construct that encodes the PTPÏ extracellular fragment with the transmembrane domain sequences only (Extra-TM) was expressed on the cell surface (see Figure 7)	 this protein failed to mediate cell aggregation of Sf9 cells	 suggesting that additional juxtamembrane sequences are required for either forming or stablizing the cell aggregates.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Expression of PTPÏ constructs in Sf9 cells Figure 2 Figure 2 PTPÏ mediates cell-cell aggregation Figure 7 Figure 7 Cell Surface Protein expression of PTPÎ¼ and the PTPÏ mutant proteins PTPÏ mediates highly specific homophilic cell-cell aggregation  To test whether PTPÏ mediates homophilic cell-cell aggregation	 one set of Sf9 cells were infected with virus expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and another set of Sf9 cells were co-infected with viruses expressing either the full-length PTPÏ or red fluorescent protein (RFP). The GFP expressing cells were mixed with equal number cells expressing full-length PTPÏ (co-expressing RFP) and the aggregation assays were performed. As shown in Fig 3A	 the GFP labeled cells did not aggregate and did not contribute to the aggregates formed by cells expressing full-length PTPÏ (RFP). These results strongly suggest that the aggregation of Sf9 cells expressing PTPÏ is mediated through a homophilic interaction among PTPÏ molecules in trans	 but not through a heterophilic interaction between molecules expressed on the surface of Sf9 cells. Interestingly	 the homophilic interaction of PTPÏ is very specific. Although 63% of the amino acid sequences of the extracellular domain of PTPÏ are identical with that of PTPRM (PTPÎ¼)	 Sf9 cells expressing PTPÏ (co-expressing RFP) did not aggregate with PTPÎ¼ expressing cells (co-expressing GFP) as shown in Fig. 3B.  Figure 3 Figure 3 PTPÏ mediates homophilic cell-cell aggregation The tumor-derived PTPRT/PTPÏ mutations in the MAM and Ig domains are defective in cell-cell aggregation  Several studies demonstrated that the MAM and Ig domains as well as the first two FNIII repeats of PTPÎ¼ are the minimal essential regions required for its homophilic interaction (13	15	17	 18). We identified 5 tumor-specific mutations that are located in the two domains (2). Among these five mutations	 the F74S mutation is located in the MAM domain and the other four mutations (A209T	 K218T	 F248S and Y280H) are located in the Ig domain (Fig. 4A). To test whether these mutations affect their ability to mediate cell-cell aggregation in Sf9 cells	 we engineered the five mutations by site-directed mutagenesis using the full-length PTPÏ baculoviral construct as the template. The five mutant proteins are expressed at the expected size and at similar levels to wild-type PTPÏ on a western blot (Fig. 4B)	 indicating that these mutations do not affect their protein stability. None of these mutations significantly alter their cell surface expression	 as all five mutant PTPÏ proteins showed strong plasma membrane staining (Fig. 4C and Fig. 7). However	 as shown in Fig. 5	 all mutant PTPÏ proteins formed smaller aggregates than that of the wild-type PTPÏ protein. To quantify the cells aggregates	 percentage of cells that are incorporate into > 5-cell clusters were counted (as described in the material and methods section). As shown in Fig. 5	 Sf9 cells expressing all the mutants formed significantly less aggregates than that of cells expressing wild-type PTPÏ. The deletion construct of PTPÏ lacking the two phosphatase domains (PTPÏ Extra-JMD-W) and the K218T mutant exhibited similar levels of aggregation that were statistically less than wild-type PTPÏ (p < 0.01). Taken together	 our data demonstrated that the five tumor-derived mutations located the MAM and Ig domains of PTPÏ are deficient in cell-cell adhesion. Therefore	 these mutations exhibit varying degrees of loss-of-function in cell adhesion.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Expression of tumor-derived PTPÏ mutants in Sf9 cells Figure 5 Figure 5 Tumor-derived mutations of PTPÏ are defective in cell-cell aggregation Mechanistically	 the defect of the PTPÏ mutations in cell-cell adhesion could be resulted from either impaired ability in homophilic binding or reduced cell surface expression. Although immunofluorescent staining indicated that those mutations do not alter cell surface expression qualitatively	 it is imperative to quantify cell surface expression of mutant PTPÏ proteins. As described in detail in the method section	 baculovirus-infected Sf9 cell surface proteins were labeled with Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin and isolated on immobilized NeutrAvidin Gel. Western blots were performed with antibodies to PTPÎ¼ (SK18) or the V5 tag. The SK18 antibody recognizes the cytoplasmic domain of both PTPÎ¼ and PTPÏ. The results shown in Fig. 7 demonstrate that full length PTPÎ¼ and the wild-type	 mutant and deleted PTPÏ proteins were expressed at the cell surface. As a control for a non-cell surface protein	 the cytoplasmic intracellular domain of PTPÎ¼ (PTPÎ¼-intra) was expressed that is detected by SK18 (9). PTPÎ¼ intra does not contain an extracellular domain and therefore is not biotinylated nor precipitated by the NeutrAvidin gel (Fig. 7). Quantitatively	 the levels of cell surface expression of the 5 tumor-derived PTPÏ mutations were similar to that of wild-type protein. If the cell surface expression level (CSE value) of wild-type PTPÏ is arbitrarily assigned as 1	 the CSE values of F74S	 A209T	 K218T	 F248S and Y280H mutations were 2.3	1.1	1.6	 0.6 and 0.8 respectively. Interestingly	 some PTPÏ mutants that contain the extracellular domain but are unable to mediate cell-cell aggregation are expressed at higher levels on the Sf9 cell surface than wild-type PTPÏ. These results suggest that defect of PTPÏ mutation in cell-cell adhesion is mainly due to reduced homophilic binding affinity of the mutant proteins. Interestingly	 the cell surface expression levels PTPÏ Extra-TM (CSE value = 27) and PTPÏ Extra-JMD-W (CSE value = 20) were much higher than that of full-length protein for unknown reasons.  Go to: Discussion We demonstrated that PTPRT/PTPÏ meditates homophilic cell-cell aggregation and five tumor-derived mutations located in the MAM and Ig domains impair this function. Our results strongly suggest that those PTPÏ loss-of-function mutations are selected for during the process of tumor development; therefore	 these mutations should play a causal role in tumorigenesis. We chose to examine whether the MAM and Ig domain mutations are deficient in cell aggregation	 because previous studies indicated that these two domains of PTPÎ¼	 a close homolog of PTPÏ	 are required for its cell-cell aggregation function (13	15	 17). Recently	 the crystal structure of the N-terminal MAM and Ig domains of PTPÎ¼ was determined at 2.7 Ã… resolution (17	 18). Five tumor-derived mutations of PTPÏ are located in the two domains and all of them can be mapped to equivalent residues in the MAM and Ig domain structure of PTPÎ¼. Based on the crystal structure	 the authors predicted that 4 of them (F74S	 A209T	 F248S and Y280H) would cause significant perturbation of the structure of PTPRT	 because these mutations dramatically alter the character of buried side-chains (17). Moreover	 the fifth mutation K218T is located on the surface of the Ig domain and the authors predicted that this mutation would directly alter protein-protein interactions (17). Our data indicated that the K218T mutation affects the size of aggregates and only a small effect on the percentage of cells incorporated into the aggregates	 suggesting that the K218T mutant may decrease the binding affinity of PTPÏ. Interestingly	 the other four mutations significantly reduce the percentage of aggregation	 therefore	 these data suggest that the F74S	 A209T	 F248S and Y280H mutations dramatically alter the domain structure and lead to perturbation of the homophilic interaction of PTPÏ. Our previous studies showed that the tumor-derived phosphatase domain mutations of PTPÏ diminish its phosphatase activity and overexpression of PTPÏ suppresses the growth of colorectal cancer cells	 indicating that PTPÏ normally act as a tumor suppressor (2). The loss-of-function nature of these five extracellular mutations provides further supportive evidence to this notion.  The finding that PTPÏ mediates homophilic cell aggregation of non-adhesive insect Sf9 cells suggests that this protein could be involved in cell-cell adhesion in human epithelial cells where it is endogenously expressed. The type IIB RPTP subfamily consists of PTPÎ¼	 PTPÎº	 PTPÏ and PCP-2. It has been shown that PTPÎ¼	 PTPÎº and PTPÎ» (PCP-2)	 mediate homophilic cell-cell adhesion (9â€“12). Interestingly	 the homophilic interaction of these RPTPs seems to be highly specific	 because we and others showed that neither PTPÏ nor PTPÎº (15) interact with PTPÎ¼. It is worth noting that the juxtamembrane domain of PTPÏ may be necessary for its cell adhesion function. As shown in Figure 2	 Sf9 cells expressing the extracellular and juxtamembrane domains of PTPÏ	 but not cells expressing the extracellular and transmembrane portion of the protein (PTPÏ Extra-TM)	 formed cell aggregates	 although both proteins were expressed on the cell surface (Fig. 7). Expression of a construct encoding the extracellular	 transmembrane and only 55 amino acids of the juxtamembrane domain of PTPÎ¼ in non-adhesive Sf9 insect cells induced cell aggregation (9). It is possible that cis interactions between the membrane proximal juxtamembrane domains are required for initiating	 stabilizing or maintaining cell-cell adhesion. Interestingly	 there are two PTPRT mutations (K788E and R790I) located in the juxtamembrane domain that are found in lung cancers (1). Moreover	 Besco et al. showed that PTPÏ interacts with cell adhesion molecules including E-cadherin	 Î±	 Î²	 and Î³-catenin	 and Î±;-actinin (19). PTPÎ¼ also binds the cadherin-catenin complex (7	 20â€“22). Loss of cell-cell adhesion	 such as genetic and epigenetic inactivation of cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin	 is thought to be a prerequisite for carcinoma invasion and metastasis (23). Therefore	 mutational inactivation of the cell adhesion function PTPÏ may also play a critical role in tumor migration and metastasis.  																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	
4	66||Tyrosine phosphorylation	 regulated by protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) and kinases (PTKs)	 is important in signaling pathways underlying tumorigenesis. A mutational analysis of the tyrosine phosphatase gene superfamily in human cancers identified 83 somatic mutations in six PTPs (PTPRF	 PTPRG	 PTPRT	 PTPN3	 PTPN13	 PTPN14)	 affecting 26% of colorectal cancers and a smaller fraction of lung	 breast	 and gastric cancers. Fifteen mutations were nonsense	 frameshift	 or splice-site alterations predicted to result in truncated proteins lacking phosphatase activity. Five missense mutations in the most commonly altered PTP (PTPRT) were biochemically examined and found to reduce phosphatase activity. Expression of wild-type but not a mutant PTPRT in human cancer cells inhibited cell growth. These observations suggest that the mutated tyrosine phosphatases are tumor suppressor genes	 regulating cellular pathways that may be amenable to therapeutic intervention. Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues is a central feature of many cellular signaling pathways	 including those affecting growth	 differentiation	 cell cycle regulation	 apoptosis	 and invasion (1	 2). This phosphorylation is coordinately controlled by protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and phosphatases (PTPs). Although a variety of PTK genes have been directly linked to tumorigenesis through somatic activating mutations (3â€“6)	 only a few PTP genes have been implicated in cancer (7â€“10). Moreover	 it is not known how many or how frequently members of the PTP gene family are altered in any particular cancer type. We have systematically addressed these issues by comprehensive mutational analysis of the PTP gene superfamily in colorectal tumors.  The PTP gene superfamily is composed of three main families: (i) the classical PTPs	 including the receptor PTPs (RPTPs) and the nonreceptor PTPs (NRPTPs); (ii) the dual specificity phosphatases (DSPs)	 which can dephosphorylate serine and threonine in addition to tyrosine residues; and (iii) the low molecular weight phosphatases (LMPs) (1). Using an approach similar to that described in a recent bioinformatic analysis of PTPs in the mouse genome (11)	 we employed a combination of Hidden Markov Models representing catalytic domains of members of the PTP superfamily to identify 53 classical PTPs (21 RPTPs and 32 NRPTPs)	 33 DSPs	 and one LMP in the human genome (12). This analysis revealed a set of genes representing all known human PTPs (13) as well as seven putative PTPs.  As an initial screen to evaluate whether these phosphatases are genetically altered in human cancer	 we analyzed the coding exons of all 87 members of this gene superfamily in 18 colorectal cancers. A total of 1375 exons from all annotated RPTPs	 NRPTPs	 DSPs	 and LMPs were extracted from genomic databases (12). These exons were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from cancer genomic DNA samples and directly sequenced with dye terminator chemistry (12). Whenever a presumptive mutation was identified	 we attempted to determine whether it was somatically acquired (i.e.	 tumor specific) by examining the sequence of the gene in genomic DNA from normal tissue of the relevant patient.  From the 3.3 Mb of sequence information obtained	 we identified six genes containing somatic mutations	 including three members of the RPTP subfamily (PTPRF	 PTPRG	 and PTPRT) and three members of the NRPTP subfamily (PTPN3	 PTPN13	 and PTPN14). These six genes were then further analyzed for mutations in another 157 colorectal cancers. Through this strategy	 we identified 77 mutations in the six genes	 in aggregate affecting 26% of the colorectal tumors analyzed (table S1 and Fig. 1). Examination of these six genes in seven other tumor types identified PTPRT mutations in two of 11 (18%) lung cancers and two of 12 gastric cancers (17%)	 and PTPRF mutations in one of 11 (9%) lung cancers and one of 11 (9%) breast cancers. No mutations were identified in 12 pancreatic cancers	 12 ovarian cancers	 12 medulloblastomas	 or 12 glioblastomas (table S1 and Fig. 1). In total	 83 nonsynonymous mutations were observed	 all of which were somatic in the cancers that could be assessed (12).    Download high-res image  Open in new tab  Download Powerpoint Fig. 1.

Black stars indicate PTPRT mutants evaluated for phosphatase activity (Fig. 2)	 and the red star indicates PTPRT mutant evaluated for effects on cell proliferation (Fig. 3).  Fifteen of the 83 mutations were nonsense	 frameshift	 or splice-site alterations	 all of which were predicted to result in aberrant or truncated proteins. In 16 tumors both alleles of the phosphatase gene appeared to be mutated	 a characteristic often associated with tumor suppressor genes. The majority of tumors with PTP gene mutations also contained mutations in KRAS or BRAF	 and nine tumors contained alterations in previously reported tyrosine kinase genes (table S1). Thus	 the mutant phosphatases identified in this study are likely to operate through cellular pathways distinct from those associated with previously identified mutant kinases.  Analysis of mutations in tumors is complicated by the fact that mutations can arise either as functional alterations affecting key genes underlying the neoplastic process or as nonfunctional â€œpassengerâ€ changes. The multiple waves of clonal expansion and selection that occur throughout tumorigenesis lead to fixation of any mutation that had previously occurred in any predecessor cell	 regardless of whether the mutation was actually responsible for the clonal expansion. Two independent lines of evidence suggest that the sequence alterations we observed are functional. First	 the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations provides an indication of selection	 as synonymous alterations usually do not exert a growth advantage. There were no somatic synonymous mutations detected in the colorectal cancers analyzed	 resulting in a ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations of 77 to 0	 much higher than the expected 2:1 ratio for nonselected passenger mutations (P < 1 Ã— 10â€“6). Second	 the prevalence of mutations in the coding regions of the analyzed genes was âˆ¼19 per Mb of tumor DNA	 similar to the prevalence of functional somatic alterations observed in other gene families [e.g.	 the tyrosine kinome (6)] and significantly higher than the prevalence of nonfunctional alterations previously observed in the cancer genomes (âˆ¼1 per Mb	 P < 0.01) (14). These data support the idea that these mutations were the targets of selection during tumorigenesis.  The great majority of the nonsense and frameshift mutations (Fig. 1) would result in polypeptides devoid of C-terminal phosphatase catalytic domains	 thereby leading to inactivation of the phosphatase. To evaluate whether tumor-specific point mutations alter phosphatase activity	 we biochemically tested mutant versions of PTPRT	 the most frequently mutated PTP in the superfamily. Mutations in both intracellular PTP domains (D1 and D2) were evaluated. His-tagged versions of the catalytic region of wild-type PTPRT	 two D1 mutants (Q987K and N1128I)	 and three D2 mutants (R1212W	 R1346L	 and T1368M) were produced in bacteria and analyzed for phosphatase activity by using 6	8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (DiFMUP) as a substrate (Fig. 2) (12). All D1 and D2 mutants had reduced phosphatase activity compared with the wild-type protein (Fig. 2). The kinetic parameter Kcat was reduced in both D1 mutants	 while Km was increased in all three D2 mutants	 suggesting that mutations in the two domains may have different effects on enzymatic activity. Although it has been thought that the D2 domain is usually catalytically inactive (1)	 our results are consistent with recent studies that show that the D2 domain is important for phosphatase activity in some receptor phosphatases (15).

His-tagged versions of PTPRT protein segments comprising the two catalytic domains containing wild-type (WT) and tumor-specific mutant sequences were expressed in bacteria and purified using nickelaffinity chromatography. Equal amounts of WT and mutant proteins were used to evaluate enzyme kinetics. The rate of hydrolysis of substrate (DiFMUP) is plotted against increasing substrate concentration. Data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menton equation	 and the resulting kinetic parameters of WT and mutant proteins are indicated in (B).  These biochemical data on missense mutations	 coupled with the large number of truncating mutations	 suggested that PTPRT functions as a tumor suppressor gene. To determine whether PTPRT expression can inhibit tumor cell growth	 we transfected wild-type PTPRT into HCT116 colorectal cancer cells (12). An identical expression vector containing an R632X mutant of PTPRT was used for comparison. Wild-type PTPRT potently inhibited cell growth in this assay	 as seen by the substantial decrease in the number of neomycin-resistant colonies compared with the R632X mutant or with vector alone (Fig. 3	 A and B). Similar results with wild-type and mutant PTPRT were also observed in DLD1 colorectal cancer cells.    Download high-res image  Open in new tab  Download Powerpoint Fig. 3.

The photographs show colonies stained with crystal violet after 14 days of geneticin selection. (B) Number of resistant colonies (mean of two 25 cm2 flasks) for WT PTPRT	 mutant PTPRT	 and empty vector.  The combination of these genetic	 biochemical	 and cellular data suggest that PTPRT and the other identified phosphatases are likely to act as tumor suppressors. This is consistent with the function of other phosphatases implicated in tumorigenesis (7	8	 16) and with the general role of phosphatases in inhibiting various growth-promoting signaling pathways (2). The absence of biallelic mutations in a subset of the analyzed tumors suggests that some alterations may act in a dominant-negative fashion or may affect gene dosage	 mechanisms that have been previously involved in inactivation of other tumor suppressor genes (17	 18).  Little is known about the functional role of the tyrosine phosphatases discussed here. PTPN13 appears to be involved in apoptosis (19) and may be partly responsible for the antitumor effects of tamoxifen (20). Overexpression of PTPN3 inhibits growth of NIH/3T3 cells	 possibly through interaction with valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97) (21). PTPN14 and PTPRF are thought to play a role in cell adhesion by regulating tyrosine phosphorylation of adherens junction proteins (22	 23). Because increased phosphorylation of adherens junctions has been shown to increase cell motility and migration (22	 24)	 mutational inactivation of these genes may be an important step in cancer cell invasion and metastasis. PTPRG maps to chromosome 3p14.2	 a region frequently lost in lung	 renal	 and early-stage breast tumors	 and is thought to be a target of the translocation at 3p14 in familial renal cell carcinoma (25â€“27). However	 no point mutations in PTPRG (28) or any of the other genes identified here have been previously described in any cancer. PTPRT is expressed in the developing central nervous system and in the adult cerebellum (29) and had not been thought to play a role in the growth or differentiation of other tissues. We have found that PTPRT is expressed in a variety of human tissues	 including normal colon epithelium as well as cells derived from colorectal cancers (fig. S1).  Phosphatases affect signaling pathways that may be amenable to therapeutic intervention in cancer cells (2). Although reactivation of incapacitated phosphatases is likely to be pharmacologically challenging	 identification of the corresponding kinases that phosphorylate substrates normally regulated by the mutant phosphatases could provide novel therapeutic targets. Like the analysis of genetic alterations in tyrosine kinases (6)	 the present study suggests the possibility of individualized therapy based on the mutant phosphatases present in specific tumors. Conceivably	 this approach would have broad therapeutic use	 because more than 50% of colorectal tumors analyzed to date have alterations in at least one member of the tyrosine phosphatome or kinome. Protein tyrosine phosphatase Ï (PTPÏ) belongs to the classical receptor type IIB family of protein tyrosine phosphatase	 the most frequently mutated tyrosine phosphatase in human cancer. There are evidences to suggest that PTPÏ may act as a tumor suppressor gene and dysregulation of Tyr phosphorylation can be observed in diverse diseases	 such as diabetes	 immune deficiencies and cancer. PTPÏ variants in the catalytic domain have been identified in cancer tissues. These natural variants are nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms	 variations of a single nucleotide occurring in the coding region and leading to amino acid substitutions. In this study we investigated the effect of amino acid substitution on the structural stability and on the activity of the membrane-proximal catalytic domain of PTPÏ. We expressed and purified as soluble recombinant proteins some of the mutants of the membrane-proximal catalytic domain of PTPÏ identified in colorectal cancer and in the single nucleotide polymorphisms database. The mutants show a decreased thermal and thermodynamic stability and decreased activation energy relative to phosphatase activity	 when compared to wild- type. All the variants show three-state equilibrium unfolding transitions similar to that of the wild- type	 with the accumulation of a folding intermediate populated at âˆ¼4.0 M urea.  Go to: Introduction The classical protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) superfamily includes 38 proteins which specifically dephosphorylate phosphotyrosine residues and	 in concert with protein tyrosine kinases	 control a large number of diverse biological processes	 such as cell proliferation	 adhesion	 apoptosis and migration [1]â€“[6]. Reversible tyrosine phosphorylation controls numerous signaling pathways which require a right balance between kinase and phosphatase activity. The involvement of PTP in controlling cellular signaling has been largely recognized [2]	 [5]	 [7]	 though the role of PTP in human diseases has not been explored so extensively as that of protein kinases. However in diverse diseases	 such as cancer	 diabetes and immune deficiencies	 dysregulation of Tyr phosphorylation has been observed [4]	 [7]	 [8].  On the basis of their counteracting activity on the oncogenic protein tyrosine kinase	 PTPs have been initially considered as potential tumor suppressors	 however it is clear that several phosphatases have oncogenic properties [2]â€“[6]	 [9]. Over the last decade a limited number of phophatases have been studied systematically to evaluate their role in tumorigenesis. In particular	 six mutated phosphatases have been directly linked to colorectal cancers [1]	 [10]; among the six mutated genes	 the PTPRT gene encoding PTPÏ (PDB accession code 2OOQ) was found to be most frequently mutated and it was also mutated in about 20% of lung and gastric cancer [10].  PTPÏ belongs to the classical receptor type IIB family of PTP. The 107 PTPs encoded by the human genome are classified into four classes	 on the basis of the amino acid sequence of their catalytic domain. Class I includes 61 dual-specificity phosphatases and 38 classical phosphotyrosine-specific phosphatase which are further divided into receptor and non-transmembrane groups [5]	 [7]. The full-length PTPÏ contains an extracellular domain	 formed by a meprin-A5 antigen-PTP (MAM) domain and Ig-like and fibronectin type III-like repeats	 a single transmembrane segment and one or two cytoplasmic catalytic domains. The catalytically active proximal D1 domain is adjacent to the membrane and is connected to the inactive membrane-distal D2 domain [3]	 [5]. The PTP membrane-proximal catalytic domain consists of about 280 residues that fold into a highly conserved Î±/Î² structure [4]	 [11]. Conserved functional elements of the catalytic PTP domain are the PTP signature motif	 the mobile â€œWPDâ€ loop	 a highly conserved aspartate residue required for catalysis and the phosphotyrosine recognition loop.  In cancer tissues several PTPÏ variants in the catalytic domain have been identified and there is evidence to suggest that PTPÏ may act as a tumor suppressor gene [10]. These natural variants are nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs)	 single nucleotide variations occurring in the coding region and leading to a polypeptide sequence with amino acid substitutions.  A large number of amino acid substitutions originate from nsSNPs and an increasingly large number of diseases and defects reported in Human Gene Mutation Database [12] and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) [13] are referred to nsSNPs [14]. Although most nsSNPs are considered not to affect protein function	 computational analysis predicts that around 30% of protein variants resulting from nsSNPs are less stable than the most common variant [15]. The effect of disease-causing nsSNPs on protein structure and function has been widely investigated by computational analysis	 and change in protein stability has been suggested as the most common mechanism involved in monogenic disease [16]â€“[18]. However	 nsSNPs may also affect and modulate the protein function by altering protein dynamics without affecting protein stability [19]. Notably	 since genetic variations related to nsSNPs may influence individual susceptibility to complex diseases such as cancer [20] or response to drugs	 a more extended study about the effect of nsSNPs on protein structure may help in understanding their role in inducing protein functional changes [21]. To date there are few experimental data available concerning the consequences of nsSNPs on protein function and stability.  In this study we investigate the effect of amino acid substitutions identified in colorectal cancer [10] and in the single nucleotide polymorphisms database [18]	 [22]	 [23] on the thermodynamic stability and on the activity of the membrane-proximal catalytic domain of PTPÏ [1]	 [24]. The analysis revealed that	 in comparison to the wild-type	 the thermal and thermodynamic stability of all the mutants are decreased as well as the activation energy relative to the phosphatase activity	 indicating an increase in protein flexibility of all the PTPÏ mutants. All the variants show three-state equilibrium unfolding transitions similar to that of the wild-type	 with the accumulation of a folding intermediate at âˆ¼4.0 M urea.  To our knowledge	 this study represents the first spectroscopic and thermodynamic characterization of human PTPÏ catalytic domain and some of its mutants found in cancer. In addition	 the effects of none of the mutations reported in this manuscript on protein thermodynamic stability has been previously investigated.  Go to: Results Four mutations of the PTPÏ membrane-proximal catalytic domain in public databases have been identified: D927G	 Q987K	 N1128I and A1118P. Introduction of these mutations resulted in soluble recombinant protein only for D927G	 Q987K and N1128I whereas the A1118P mutant could not be expressed in the soluble fraction even when different growth and induction conditions were used. Mapping of the mutations onto the structure of the PTPÏ catalytic domain revealed that A1118P is located in the middle of a central helix (Fig. 1). It is likely that the introduction of a proline residue at this position in substitution of alanine will break the helical secondary structure resulting in misfolding of the catalytic domain. N1128 is located at the C-terminal end of the same helix (Fig. 1B). This residue is located in a very polar environment with flanking acidic (E1124	 E1127	 E1129) and a histidine residue (H974) located in a neighbouring loop region. D927G and Q987K are located in solvent exposed loops with little interaction with other amino acid side chains (Fig. 1C). The solvent accessibility of the mutated residues Asp-927 and Gln-987 is more than 70% and Asn-1128 is 49% solvent exposed. The mutation D927G involves a residue (Asp-927) placed in a 4 residues turn between two coils. In the wild-type Asp-927 connects different protein secondary structure regions through hydrogen bonds with three residues. One hydrogen bond is between the N of the peptide bond and the OD2 of Asp-947 and the other two hydrogen bonds are between the carbonyl of the peptide bond and the amidic nitrogens of Lys-930 and Glu-931. The carboxylic moiety of Asp-927 is completely solvent exposed and does not apparently make any contact with other residues.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Location of PTPÏ mutations. Spectroscopic characterization of PTPÏ wild-type and its mutants  The near-UV CD spectrum of wild-type PTPÏ shows the contribution of all aromatic residues and is characterized by two negative components centred at 280 nm and at around 298 nm accompanied by fine structure features at 275â€“280 nm (Fig. 2A). Q987K variant displays a near-UV CD spectrum almost identical to that of the wild-type as well as D927G and N1128I	 which nevertheless show a slight decrease of the dichroic activity at 275â€“280 nm. In line with the near-UV CD results	 which suggest a similar tertiary arrangement for the wild-type and all the variants	 the fluorescence emission spectra of mutants are similar to that of wild-type protein	 being all centred at the same maximum emission wavelength around 338 nm but characterized by a decreased emission fluorescence intensity (Fig. 2B). Far-UV CD spectra of all the PTPÏ mutants superimpose well with that of the wild-type and are typical of an alpha and beta protein	 showing a local minimum at around 208 nm	 a 200 nm zero intercept and a 1.13 ratio of the 208/222 bands (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that the SNP mutations had no effect on the secondary structure of the protein and suggest that	 in the native state	 the effect of the mutations are directed and localized to the mutated residue with minor modification of tertiary arrangements.  Figure 2 Figure 2 Spectroscopic properties of PTPÏ wild-type and mutants. Thermal unfolding  The thermal stability of D927G	 Q987K and N1128I was investigated by continuously monitoring the ellipticity changes at 209 nm between 10 and 72Â°C in comparison with that of wild-type (Fig. 3). The parameter chosen to compare the transition curves of PTPÏ wild-type and mutants is the melting temperature (Tm) defined as the mid point of the denaturation process calculated by plotting the first derivative of the molar ellipticity values as a function of temperature (Fig. 3	 inset). The temperature-induced ellipticity changes at 209 nm	 where the main amplitude was observed	 occur in an apparent cooperative transition for PTPÏ wild-type	 Q987K	 N1128I and D927G	 and with apparent Tm values of 43.0	42	 41.0 and 40.0Â°C	 respectively. The temperature-induced ellipticity changes for wild type and mutants are all coincident with the heat-induced increase of the photomultiplier tube voltage (PMTV) above 370 V (Fig. 3B)	 suggesting that the temperature-induced unfolding is accompanied by protein aggregation [25]. Aggregation occurred also when thermal scans were performed at a lower heating rate with a low-temperature shifts of the apparent Tm; the differences between the apparent Tm of wild type and variants were the same as those measured at higher heating rate (data not shown). The observed transitions are irreversible as indicated by the spectra measured at the end of the cooling phase that differ from those of the native proteins measured at the beginning of the thermal transitions (data not shown). Furthermore	 inspection of the cuvette at the end of the cooling phase revealed the presence of a large amount of precipitate in all the samples.  Figure 3 Figure 3 Thermal transition of PTPÏ wild-type and mutants. Temperature dependence of phosphatase activity  The temperature dependence of phosphatase activity of PTPÏ wild-type and variants was examined over the temperature range of 10â€“42Â°C (Fig. 4A). The optimal temperatures were estimated to be at 37Â°C for wild type and Q987K	 at around 33Â°C for N1128I and at 30Â°C for D927G (Fig. 4A). Notably	 at 37Â°C	 the phosphatase activity of all PTPÏ variants is significantly reduced and corresponds to 72	 54 and 20% of that of the wild-type protein for Q987K	 N1128I and D927G	 respectively. The activation energy	 Eaâ€¡	 determined by the Arrhenius equation (1) in the temperature range between 10Â°C and the optimal temperature of each protein	 corresponds to 13.88Â±0.40 kcal/mol for the wild-type and to 12.77Â±0.51	 10.73Â±0.54 and 11.38Â±0.46 kcal/mol for N1128I	 D927G and Q987K (Fig. 4B)	 respectively. This result suggests an increased flexibility of all the variants compared to the wild-type	 particularly evident for N1128I and D927G whose phosphatase activity is significantly decreased at 42Â°C. The comparison of temperature dependence of phosphatase activity with the structural thermal unfolding monitored at 209 nm clearly indicates that the D927G and N1128I variants are significantly more flexible and less thermal resistant than the wild-type.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Effect of temperature on phosphatase activity of PTPÏ wild-type and mutants. Urea-induced equilibrium unfolding transitions  PTPÏ wild-type and variants reversibly unfold in urea at 10Â°C in 20 mM TrisHCl	 pH 7.5	 containing 200 ÂµM DTT and 0.2 M NaCl. The effect of increasing urea concentrations (0â€“8 M) on the structure of PTPÏ mutants was analyzed by far-UV CD and intrinsic fluorescence emission spectroscopy and compared to the wild-type.  Incubation of PTPÏ wild-type and variants at increasing urea concentrations at 10Â°C for 30 min	 a time sufficient to reach the equilibrium	 resulted in a progressive change of the intrinsic fluorescence emission intensity and a red-shift of the maximal emission wavelength. At the end of the transition	 above 7 M urea	 the intrinsic fluorescence emission intensity is increased about 1.5 fold and the maximal fluorescence emission wavelength shifts to around 358 nm either for the wild-type and all the variants (Fig. 5). Determination of the red-shift of the intrinsic fluorescence emission was obtained by calculating the intensity averaged emission wavelength An external file that holds a picture	 illustration	 etc. Object name is pone.0032555.e001.jpg at increasing urea concentration (Fig. 6A). This parameter is an integral measurement	 negligibly influenced by the noise	 and reflects changes in both the shape and the position of the emission spectrum.  Figure 5 Figure 5 Intrinsic fluorescence emission spectra of PTPÏ wild-type and mutants. Figure 6 Figure 6 Urea-induced equilibrium unfolding of PTPÏ wild-type and mutants. The same samples used to monitor the fluorescence emission changes during the unfolding transition were used to monitor far-UV CD ellipticity (Fig. 6A). The unfolding process is fully reversible upon dilution of the denaturant	 either for the wild-type as well as for all the mutants (Fig. 6A). The urea-induced changes in intensity averaged emission wavelength An external file that holds a picture	 illustration	 etc. Object name is pone.0032555.e003.jpg and in 222 nm ellipticity of all the mutants are similar to that of the wild-type and show a sigmoidal dependence on urea concentration	 following an apparent two-state transition. However	 the transitions monitored by ellipticity changes and An external file that holds a picture	 illustration	 etc. Object name is pone.0032555.e004.jpg changes do not coincide (Fig. 6A) suggesting the possible presence of an intermediate in the transition region at approximately 4 M urea for the wild-type and for all the variants. The plot of the relative fluorescence intensity changes versus urea concentration shows a complex dependence upon increasing denaturant concentration for the wild-type and all the mutants (Fig. 6B). The data in Fig. 6B clearly indicate a non two-state unfolding process and the population of a denaturation intermediate at about the same urea concentration of the apparent denaturation midpoints observed by ellipticity and An external file that holds a picture	 illustration	 etc. Object name is pone.0032555.e005.jpg averaged changes (Fig. 6 A and B). The folding intermediate detected by relative fluorescence intensity is populated at around 4.45 M urea for wild-type and Q987K and at around 3.95 M urea for D927G and N1128I. The intrinsic fluorescence emission spectra of the folding intermediate are similar for all the proteins: the fluorescence intensity is increased of about 1.5 fold and the maximum emission wavelength is shifted from 338 to 345 nm	 with respect to the native state (Fig. 5). The hyperfluorescent intermediate of wild-type and variants retains about 35% of the 222 nm ellipticity of the native state (Fig. 6A).  The transitions monitored by relative fluorescence intensity changes (Fig. 6B) were fitted to a three-state unfolding process which yielded the thermodynamic parameters for wild-type and the variants of PTPÏ (Table 1). For the first transition	 m values are all closely similar to that of the wild-type	 suggesting a similar unfolding mechanism for all the variants; Î”G values lower than that of the wild-type are observed for N1128I and D927G	 suggesting a destabilization of the native state for these two variants	 that also show a decreased thermal stability (see Fig. 3 and and4).4). For the second transition	 that represents the unfolding of the intermediate to the denatured state	 the m values of all the proteins are lower than those of the first transition	 indicating that a larger increase in solvent-exposed surface area occur in the unfolding from the native to the intermediate state (Table 1). Notably	 Î”G values relative to the second unfolding transition for N1128I and Q987K are larger than those relative to the first transition	 suggesting a higher stability of the intermediate states	 compared to that of the wild-type.  Table 1 Table 1 Thermodynamic parameters for urea-induced unfolding equilibrium of PTPÏwild-type and mutants. The near-UV CD changes of D927G	 the most temperature sensitive variant	 upon increasing urea concentrations were monitored in comparison with wild-type (Fig. 7) to better characterize the nature of the intermediate state. The resulting data were analyzed after removal of the high-frequency noise and the low-frequency random error by a singular value decomposition algorithm (SVD) which resolved two main spectra components either for wild-type or for the mutant D927G. The most significant singular values were 2.05Ã—103 for wild-type and 1.96Ã—103 for D927G	 the second singular values were 38.2% and 40.1% of the first singular value for wild-type and D927G	 respectively. The plots of the first (V1) and of the second column (V2) of the V matrix which reflect the global change in the 250â€“320 nm region as a function of urea concentration show non-two state transition profiles comparable to the transitions monitored by intrinsic fluorescence emission intensity and confirm the accumulation of an intermediate at around 4.2 M urea (Fig. 7 B	 and C). At this denaturant concentration	 the near-UV CD spectra of wild-type and D927G significantly differ from those of the native state and are completely opposite in sign (Fig. 7A). The 298 nm negative band is lost and a positive contribution at 289 nm is present in the spectra of the intermediate state of both proteins. Furthermore	 the 280â€“260 nm region	 dominated by contribution of Phe and Tyr residues	 in D927G is less defined than the wild-type (Fig. 7A). The data clearly indicate that both the spectral components of the wild-type and D927G contribute to the urea induced transitions with the accumulation of a denaturation intermediate at the same urea concentration range observed by monitoring intrinsic fluorescence intensity (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6B).  Figure 7 Figure 7 Effect of urea on near-UV CD spectra of PTPÏ wild-type and D927G. The urea-induced unfolding transitions monitored by far-UV CD ellipticity changes are non-coincident with those monitored by fluorescence (Fig. 6) and near-UV CD (Fig. 7). To identify the number of spectral components contributing to the urea-induced ellipticity changes	 far-UV CD spectra were analysed after removal of the high-frequency noise and the low-frequency random error by SVD. The global changes in the spectral region 213â€“250 nm	 analyzed by SVD	 indicate that only two spectral components contribute to the far-UV CD spectra of wild-type and all the variants. The most significant singular values are very similar for wild-type and all the variants and range between 1.76Ã—105 and 1.67Ã—105. The second singular values are 19.8% of the first singular value for the wild-type	 16.6% for the D927G variant	 11.2% for Q987K and 8.0% for N1128I. All the other singular values are below 7.0% of the largest singular value and progressively decrease approaching to zero. The plots of the first column of the V matrix (V1)	 which reflect the global change in the 213â€“250 nm region	 as a function of urea concentration (data not shown) show sigmoidal transition profiles comparable to the transitions monitored at 222 nm for the wild-type and the variants (data not shown). Non cooperative changes of V2 at increasing denaturant are observed. Furthermore	 the reconstituted spectra of the first spectral component superimposed well with those of the sum of the first and the second spectral component (data not shown)	 indicating that only the first spectral component contributed to the urea induced transitions monitored by ellipticity at 222 nm. These results indicate an apparent two-state process for far-UV CD unfolding transitions of wild-type and variants. Thus the data have been globally fitted to a two-state model according to equation 4 with the m parameter shared between all the data sets. The free energy of unfolding	 Î”GH2O	 of wild-type and mutants obtained from the global fitting are very similar and correspond to 3.56Â±0.09	 3.63Â±0.10	 3.65Â±0.10 and 3.82Â±0.07 kcal/mol for wild-type	 N1128I	 D927G and Q987 K	 respectively	 for a shared m value of 1.06Â±0.05 kcal/mol/M. Equilibrium unfolding of PTPÏ wild-type and variants occurs via a hyperfluorescent intermediate state that cannot be detected by far-UV CD. Hence	 the thermodynamic folding intermediate may represent a conformational change which occurs in the proximity of any of the tryptophans most likely due to an increase of native state flexibility [26].  Go to: Discussion PTPÏ	 which belongs to the classical receptor type IIB family of PTP	 is one of the most frequently mutated PTP in human cancers [1]	 [24]. In this study we investigated the effect of amino acid substitution on the thermal and thermodynamic stability and on the activity	 of the membrane-proximal catalytic D1 domain of PTPÏ. Catalytically active fragments of several PTPs of type IIB family are proteolytically cleaved and released within the cytoplasm of tumour cells [27]â€“[29]	 hence the biophysical characterization of this catalytic domain may be relevant. The D1 domain is a monomeric	 structurally independent and stable folding unit characterized by a high thermodynamic stability. In this study	 we selected PTPÏ mutations of D1 domain found in colorectal cancers [10] and reported in nsSNP database [14]	 D927G	 Q987K	 A1118P and N1128I. All the mutants are expressed as soluble recombinant proteins	 except A1118P which remains insoluble also upon different growth and induction conditions. The spectroscopic properties of the wild-type compared with those of all the variants indicate that the mutations D927G	 Q987K and N1128I had no effect on protein secondary structure with minor modifications of tertiary arrangements.  All the mutants show a decrease in the thermal stability and in the activation energy for phosphatase activity with respect to the wild-type indicating an increase in protein flexibility of all the mutants. Hence	 at 37Â°C the phosphatase activity of all the variants was significantly reduced	 similarly to what reported by Wang et al. for Q987K and N1128I [10]. The most destabilizing mutation	 D927G	 yielded a protein that at physiological temperature was almost completely inactive.  All the mutations studied here are located at very diverse positions in the structure	 distant from the catalytic site and	 except A1118P	 in solvent-exposed loop regions. Presumably	 the change in main chain flexibility caused by the most destabilizing D927G mutation may lead to local disorder and may affect the stabilizing hydrogen bonds of residues in close proximity (Asp-947	 Lys-930 and Glu-931). This hypothesis is in agreement with the changes in local environment of aromatic residues suggested by the comparison of the near-UV CD spectrum of D927G with that of the wild-type. The N1128I mutation is less destabilizing than D927G. In the wild-type structure N1128	 about 50% solvent accessible	 is located in a very polar environment at the C-terminus of helix 8 and is involved	 through its peptidic nitrogen	 in a hydrogen bond with the peptide carbonyl of Asp-1124. The susbtitution of a polar residue	 Asn-1128	 to a nonpolar residue	 Ile	 may also contribute to destabilize the N1128I mutant. Q987K is the least destabilizing mutation with regard to thermal stability and temperature dependence of phosphatase activity	 probably due to the fact that Gln-987 in the wild-type structure is not involved in any interaction with other protein residues.  All the variants	 as revealed by intrinsic fluorescence emission intensity	 show three-state equilibrium unfolding transitions similar to that of the wild-type	 with the accumulation of a hyperfluorescent intermediate at âˆ¼4.0 M urea that retains 35% of the native secondary structure ellipticity. The hyperfluorescent intermediate of wild-type and of D927G	 the most temperature sensitive variant	 contains tertiary contacts	 although the packing of aromatic side-chains appears different from that of the native state.  The reversibility of the urea-induced unfolding equilibrium at low temperature allows a quantitative determination of the effect of mutations on the thermodynamic parameters of PTPÏ catalytic domain. The destabilizing effect of mutations caused by nsSNPs on PTPÏ thermodynamic stability (Table 1) may be referred i) to a destabilization of the native state for N1128I and D927G	 as indicated by the values of Î”GH2OI-N lower than that of the wild-type	 and ii) to a stabilization of the intermediate for all the variants	 as suggested by the higher free energy of unfolding from the intermediate to the unfolded state (Î”GH2OU-I)	 with respect to that of the wild-type (Table 1). The destabilizing effect of D927G and N1128I substitutions is also evident from the decrease in melting temperature monitored by secondary structure changes and from the significant reduction of phosphatase activity at 37Â°C that suggests a higher flexibility of the two variants with respect to the wild-type.  The reversible equilibrium unfolding transitions monitored by far-UV CD are not coincident with those monitored by near-UV CD and intrinsic fluorescence emission intensity and do not reveal any denaturation intermediate. The thermodynamic parameters relative to the apparent two-state equilibrium unfolding measured by far-UV CD do not indicate any significant difference between the variants and the wild-type and are lower than those determined by intrinsic fluorescence emission intensity. In particular	 the shared m value of 1.06 kcal/mol/M calculated from global fitting of the far-UV CD equilibrium unfolding data is significantly lower than the predicted m value for a monomeric protein of 280 amino acid residues unfolded in urea which is 3.71Â±0.3 kcal/mol/M [30]	 a value closely similar to that measured by fluorescence intensity. As a matter of fact	 fluorescence intensity is extremely sensitive to the microenvironment of a fluorophore and is considered as the most straightforward signal that can be related to thermodynamics of unfolding transitions [31]. The discrepancy between the thermodynamic parameters obtained by far-UV CD and fluorescence intensity and the lack of a detectable intermediate by far-UV CD may indicate that the hyperfluorescent intermediate state represents conformational changes which occur in the proximity of any of the tryptophans	 with an alternative tertiary arrangement. In the native state	 the maximum emission wavelength (Î»maxâ€Š=â€Š338 nm) indicate that tryptophan residues are shielded from the solvent	 whereas a partial exposure of tryptophan residues to the solvent is observed for the intermediate (Î»maxâ€Š=â€Š345 nm). These results are in agreement with the structural data which indicate that in PTPÏ two out of the five tryptophans	 Trp-994 and Trp-998	 are located in the same helical region (helix 6) and Trp-926	 Trp-1023 and Trp-1072 are placed in coil regions. All the five tryptophans are almost completely buried. In the native state the solvent accessibility of the five chromophores is 15% for Trp-998	 14% for Trp-926 and 4% for Trp-1023	 whereas all the other tryptophan residues are completely buried. Hence	 at approximately 4.0 M urea	 it is impossible to assign to any of the five chromophores a particular role in the fluorescence properties of the intermediate state.  In conclusion our results revealed a destabilizing and inactivating role of the mutations of PTPÏ D1 domain found in colorectal cancers [10]. All the amino acid mutations studied here are on the surface of PTPÏ and could potentially participate in protein-protein interactions. The stabilization of a folding intermediate	 coincident with an alternative tertiary arrangement	 may play a role in recognition and interaction with other substrate proteins as well as in sensitivity of this phosphatase to degradation.  																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	
7	67||Genes encoding components of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling axis are frequently mutated in cancer	 but few mutations have been characterized in MTOR	 the gene for the mTOR kinase. Using publicly available tumor genome sequencing data	 we generated a comprehensive catalog of mTOR pathway mutations in cancer	 identifying 33 MTOR mutations that confer pathway hyperactivation. The mutations cluster in six distinct regions in the C-terminal half of mTOR and occur in multiple cancer types	 with one cluster particularly prominent in kidney cancer. The activating mutations do not affect mTOR complex assembly	 but a subset reduces binding to the mTOR inhibitor Deptor. mTORC1 signaling in cells expressing various activating mutations remains sensitive to pharmacological mTOR inhibition	 but is partially resistant to nutrient deprivation. Lastly	 cancer cell lines with hyperactivating MTOR mutations display heightened sensitivity to rapamycin both in culture and as in vivo xenografts	 suggesting that such mutations confer mTOR pathway dependency.  Keywords: personalized	 mTOR	 mutations	 biomarker	 deptor Go to: Introduction In mammals	 the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway regulates cell size	 mRNA translation	 autophagy and many metabolic processes	 including lipid synthesis (1). A variety of upstream regulators control the activity of the serine/threonine protein kinase mTOR and many of these are deregulated in cancer	 resulting in pathway hyperactivation. Such activation occurs most commonly through loss-of-function mutations in tumor suppressors	 such as phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)	 tuberous sclerosis 1/2 (TSC1/2)	 neurofibromin 1/2 (NF1/2)	 or oncogenic mutations in KRAS	 PIK3CA	 or AKT (2). However	 few cancer-associated mutations have been functionally characterized in MTOR itself	 with only two reports thus far describing such mutations. In the first report	 the authors tested six cancer-associated MTOR mutations and observed that two (S2215Y from a colorectal sample and R2505P from a kidney sample) conferred mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activation (3). In the second report	 the authors identified an mTORC1 activating MTOR mutation (L2431P) that was present in a portion but not the entirety of a primary kidney tumor (4). Although these initial reports establish that activating MTOR mutations do arise in cancer	 they were based upon limited sample sets that do not reflect the diverse subtypes of cancer. More recently	 cancer genome sequencing projects	 such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE)	 have identified a vast number of somatic mutations in thousands of tumors from more than 40 cancer subtypes (5-7).  Using publicly available databases of cancer genome sequence data	 we cataloged all mutations in mTOR pathway components. We annotated over 400 samples with missense mutations in the MTOR gene from dozens of cancer subtypes	 most of which lie within six clusters in the part of the gene that encodes the C-terminal portion of mTOR. Furthermore	 through functional analyses	 we identify 33 novel mTOR pathway-activating mutations	 some of which affect the capacity of mTOR to interact with its partner proteins. None of the activating mutations impact the sensitivity of mTORC1 activity in cells to mTOR inhibitors but a subset confer mTORC1 signaling resistance to nutrient deprivation. Importantly	 cancer cells that naturally express a subset of the mutations are hypersensitive to the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. These findings may have translational relevance as rapamycin analogs (rapalogs) are clinically approved for the treatment of cancer	 and several ATP-competitive mTOR kinase inhibitors are in development (8). As tumor biopsies are increasingly subjected to whole exome sequencing	 the hyperactivating MTOR mutations we characterize may serve as biomarkers in predicting cancer response to mTOR-targeting drugs.  Go to: Results Catalog of recurring mutations in genes encoding mTOR pathway components  To generate a comprehensive catalog of all cancer-associated missense mutations in canonical genes of the mTOR pathway	 we analyzed partial genome sequencing data from the TCGA	 CCLE	 International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) databases (5-7	9	 10). This analysis revealed that almost every gene in the mTOR pathway harbored somatic point mutations (Supplementary Table 1). To enrich for mutations that are more likely to affect pathway function	 only mutations that alter the same codon more than once were counted. When normalized for gene length	 this analysis revealed that MTOR contained the highest percentage of recurring mutations	 and thus we focused most of our attention on these mutations (Supplementary Figure 1). Collectively	 through data mining and a literature search	 we curated over 400 samples with non-synonymous MTOR point mutations (Figure 1B and Supplementary Table 2) (11-17). While the majority of these mutations are represented by only one sample in our database	 approximately 40% are recurrent	 most of which have not been previously described. Additionally	 the mutations cluster in six distinct regions of mTOR centered on highly recurrent mutations that alter amino acids C1483	 E1799	 T1977	 S2215	 L2427 and R2505 (Figure 1C). The presence of these clusters suggests that there is a selective advantage to acquiring mutations in certain regions of the mTOR protein. Furthermore	 these mutations are present in multiple cancer subtypes	 with the highest number in colorectal	 endometrial	 and lung cancers	 although these cancer subtypes are also considered to have the highest mutation rates (Figures 1D and 1E) (18). Interestingly	 a random mutagenesis screen in the S. pombe mTOR homolog (tor2) identified activating mutations in homologous amino acid positions to many of those we find in MTOR to be recurrently mutated in cancer (19) (Supplementary Table 3).  Figure 1 Figure 1 Cancer-associated MTOR mutations mTORC1/2 activating mutations in MTOR  The prevalence of the recurrent mutations	 their clustering	 and correlation with activating tor2 mutations strongly suggested that the MTOR mutations impact mTOR pathway activity. To test this possibility	 wild-type (WT) or ten different mutants of mTOR (L1460P	 C1483F	 E1799K	 F1888L	 T1977R	 V2006I	 S2215Y	 I2500F	 R2505P	 and D2512H) were expressed in cells and phosphorylation of the mTORC1/2 substrates S6K1	 4EBP1	 or Akt1 examined (Figures 2A	 2B	 and 2C). All the mTOR mutants conferred varying degrees of pathway activation	 and	 interestingly	 a few displayed some substrate preference (L1460P	 C1483F	 S2215Y	 and R2505P towards S6K1/4EBP1 or V2006I towards Akt1)	 implying that these mutations have greater effects on mTORC1 or mTORC2. Thus	 while three pathway activating MTOR mutations have previously been identified (3	 4)	 our initial analyses uncovered an additional eight recurrent MTOR mutations which activate mTORC1 and/or mTORC2.  Figure 2 Figure 2 mTORC1 and mTORC2 activating mutations in MTOR and RHEB It is well established that two activating mutations (E545K and H1047R) within the phosphatidylinositol-4	5-bisphosphate 3-kinase	 catalytic subunit alpha (PI3K-p110Î±)	 encoded by the PIK3CA gene	 can lead to mTOR pathway activation (20). To determine the degree of mTOR pathway activation conferred by mTOR mutation	 S6K1 phosphorylation from cells expressing WT or S2215Y mTOR was compared to cells expressing WT or mutant PI3K-p110Î± (Supplementary Figures 2A and 2B). This revealed that while expression of only mutant mTOR conferred mTORC1 activation	 expression of either WT or mutant PI3K-p110Î± induced mTORC1 activity.  Non-recurrent MTOR mutations that activate mTORC1 signaling  We next examined in more detail the nature of the activating MTOR mutations	 and observed that while some codons are mutated to only one other residue (e.g. E1799K)	 others are mutated to several different amino acids (e.g. S2215F/P/T/Y). This is reminiscent of the diverse amino acids to which the G12 residue of KRAS is mutated in cancers (21). We expressed 20 such MTOR mutations and found that many (C1483R/W/Y	 F1888I	 T1977K	 S2215F/P	 I2500M)	 but not all (A41P/S/T	 F1888V	 T1977S	 V2006L	 S2215T	 R2505Q/*	 D2512G/Y)	 led to increased S6K1 phosphorylation (Supplementary Figures 3 and 5	 and data not shown). Given that most of these activating mutations are found only once in our dataset implies that other non-recurrent mutations may also activate mTORC1 signaling. To identify other such mutations	 we turned our attention to the mutational clusters identified in Figure 1	 and observed that while most are represented by several tissue types	 those in the C1483 cluster are particularly prevalent in kidney cancer (Figure 1E and Supplementary Figure 3D). Interestingly	 two recent cancer genome sequencing efforts reported that kidney cancers have an increased percentage of mutations in mTOR pathway genes	 but the functional consequences of these mutations were not evaluated (13	 22). Expression of the ten kidney cancer-associated MTOR mutations from the C1483 cluster revealed that in addition to the previously evaluated L1460P and C1483F/Y mutants (Figure 1B and Supplemental Figure 2)	 three non-recurrent mutants (L1433S	 A1459P	 and E1519T) also induced mTORC1 pathway activity (Figure 2D). Similarly	 expression of eight non-recurrent mutations from the S2215 cluster (N2206S	 L2209V	 A2210P	 L2216P	 R2217W	 L2220F	 Q2223K	 and A2226S) activated mTORC1 signaling as measured by S6K1 phosphorylation	 with the L2209V mutant conferring higher activation than even S2215Y (Supplementary Figure 3E). Lastly	 other than the S2215Y and R2505P mutations	 the only other cancer-associated MTOR mutation previously characterized is L2431P from a kidney cancer patient (4). Expression of mTOR containing this non-recurrent mutation caused mTORC1 activation that was much weaker than that caused by expression of the S2215Y mutant (Supplementary Figure 3F). Collectively	 these results suggest that while most non-recurrent MTOR mutations found in cancer are part of the mutational â€œnoiseâ€	 there exists a diverse set of MTOR mutations that can drive mTORC1 pathway activity. Likely	 as more cancer genomes are sequenced	 the activating non-recurrent mutations we identified will prove to be recurrent.  Recurrent mutations in RHEB activate mTORC1  We also observed that other mTOR pathway genes such as Raptor	 Rictor	 and Rheb1 harbored recurrent mutations (Supplemental Table 1). Expression of Rheb1 Y35N/C/H and to a lesser degree E139K increased phosphorylation of endogenous S6K1 more than that of WT Rheb1 (Figure 2E)	 while recurrent mutations in Raptor (R788C) or Rictor (S1101L) failed to induce any mTORC1 or mTORC2 activity (data not shown). In support of the relevance of these mutations to cancer	 RHEB was recently highlighted as a novel cancer gene due to the presence of the Y35N mutation (23). Thus	 cancer associated mutations in either MTOR or RHEB can induce mTORC1 activity; whether this is true of other mTOR pathway genes remains to be determined.  mTORC1/2 hyperactivating mutants bind less Deptor  One potential mechanism through which the mutations in mTOR (Figure 2) might increase S6K1/Akt1 phosphorylation is by altering mTORC1 or mTORC2 assembly. Alternatively or in addition	 the mTOR mutations may diminish the binding of mTOR to its endogenous inhibitor Deptor	 which binds to the FAT domain of mTOR (24). To test these possibilities	 the interactions of exogenously expressed WT or mutant mTORs with endogenous Raptor	 Rictor	 and Deptor were measured. All mutant mTOR proteins bound equally well to Raptor and Rictor	 suggesting that the mutations do not affect formation of either mTOR complex (Figure 3A). In contrast	 Deptor binding to the immunoprecipitated mTOR proteins was reduced in cells expressing the mTOR mutants as compared to WT mTOR (Figure 3A). Given that increased mTOR pathway activity correlates with a reduction in the mTOR-Deptor interaction (24)	 it is likely that the observed decrease in Deptor binding reflects the increased mTOR pathway activity caused by the MTOR mutations. However	 two mTORC1 activating mutations that are in the FAT domain of mTOR	 L1460P and C1483Y	 bound much less Deptor than the other mutants tested (Figure 3A)	 suggesting that these mutations directly perturb the Deptor binding site on mTOR. Consistent with this	 examination of the mutations from the C1483 cluster described in figure 2D revealed that two other highly activating mutations in the FAT domain (A1459P and C1483Y) also strongly reduced the mTOR-Deptor interaction (Supplementary Figure 4A). While these results suggest a possible mechanism of action for a subset of activating mTOR mutations	 they do not preclude other mechanism by which MTOR mutations may impact mTORC1 signaling	 such as by increasing the activity of the mTOR kinase domain.  Figure 3 Figure 3 mTOR mutants bind less Deptor and cells expressing the mTOR S2215Y mutation are resistant to nutrient deprivation MTOR mutations do not affect mTORC1 sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors but can affect the pathway response to nutrient deprivation  We next considered the possibility that the mTORC1-activating MTOR mutants have altered sensitivity to established mTOR inhibitors. Engineered mutations in the FRB domain of mTOR	 which binds the FKBP12-rapamycin complex	 confer marked rapamycin resistance to mTOR (25). To test whether mTOR mutation alters pathway inhibition by rapamycin or Torin1 (an investigational ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor)	 we used HEK-293 cells with an integrated FLP recombination site (TREX cells) to stably express WT or several different mutants of mTOR (A1459P	 C1483Y	 E1799K	 F1888I	 L2209V	 S2215Y	 L2431P	 I2500F	 and R2505P)	 as the mTOR cDNA is too large to be packaged and expressed via a lentiviral delivery system (Supplementary Figure 4B). Baseline phosphorylation of endogenous S6K1 was higher in TREX cells expressing the A1459P	 L2209V	 S2215Y	 I2500F and R2505P mTOR mutants than in parental or WT-expressing cells (Figure 3B and Supplementary Figures 4C and 4D)	 consistent with the results obtained upon transient expression of these mutants (Figures 2A and 2D	 and Supplementary Figure 3D). Importantly	 mTORC1 activity in none of the TREX cells was resistant to rapamycin	 Torin1	 MLN0128 (an mTOR ATP-competitive inhibitor)	 GDC0980 (a dual PI3K/mTOR ATP-competitive inhibitor)	 (Figure 3B and Supplementary Figures 4C and 4D). Thus	 on a molecular level	 while cells with mTOR mutations may display high levels of mTORC1/2 activity	 this activity is still sensitive to pharmacological mTOR inhibition.  The kinase activity of mTOR is tightly regulated by nutrient availability; when cells are starved of nutrients (specifically glucose and amino acids)	 they downregulate mTORC1 signaling	 while retreatment of cells with these nutrients restores mTORC1-mediated signaling (26). Given this	 we sought to determine whether any of the activating mTOR mutants affect the sensitivity of mTORC1 signaling to amino acid or glucose withdrawal. Indeed	 S6K1 phosphorylation was highly resistant to deprivation of either nutrient in cells expressing several mutants (A1459P	 S2215Y	 I2500F and R2505P) (Figure 3C and Supplementary Figures 4E and 4F). This observation may be relevant in the context of developing tumors	 which are often glucose starved (27	 28)	 where inappropriate mTORC1 activity may provide a growth advantage.  Cancer cells with hyperactivating MTOR mutations are hypersensitive to rapamycin in vitro and in vivo  To determine if cancer cells with MTOR mutations are dependent on mTORC1 activity	 we evaluated the impact of rapamycin on the proliferation of set of cancer cell lines harboring WT or mutant mTOR (Figure 4A). We identified four cell lines with mTORC1-activating MTOR mutations (C1483Y in MOLT16; E1799K in HEC59 and SNU349; and S2215Y in JHUEM7) and two with MTOR mutations that have no apparent impact on mTORC1 signaling (V2006L in TUHR10TKB; and R2152C in A375) (Supplementary Figures 5A and 5B). HeLa cells were used as a negative control cell line	 as they are mildly rapamycin sensitive and are wild-type for mTOR (7	 29). MCF7 and SW780 cells	 which are also wild-type for mTOR	 served as positive controls for rapamycin sensitivity because the MCF7 cells harbor an activating PI3K-p110Î± mutation (E545K) while the SW780 cells lack NPRL2	 which encodes a component of the GATOR1 negative regulator of the amino acid-sensing pathway (30	 31). Importantly	 only the cell lines with activating MTOR mutations	 the PI3K-p110Î± mutant	 or the NPRL2-null SW780 cells were hypersensitive to rapamycin treatment (Figure 4B). Consistent with these and published results	 the growth of HeLa xenografts was partially rapamycin sensitive	 while rapamycin completely halted the growth of HEC59 xenografts	 which carry the hyperactivating mTOR E1799K mutation (Figure 4C) (32	 33). These results suggest that the presence of hyperactivating MTOR mutations in cancer cells may serve as biomarkers to identify tumors that are likely to respond to mTOR inhibitors.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Rapamycin inhibits the proliferation of cancer cell lines with hyperactivating MTOR mutations Go to: Discussion Early cancer genome sequencing projects led to the identification of three mutations in MTOR that were shown to activate mTORC1 signaling (3	 4). Here	 we have identified an additional 33 previously unknown activating MTOR mutations (some are recurrent	 others are not) (Supplementary Table 4). Mechanistically	 we find that the activating mutations diminish the mTOR-Deptor interaction and interestingly	 when mapped onto the recently solved crystal structure of mTOR	 the mutations cluster in several distinct locations within the protein itself	 suggesting that other activating mechanisms may exist (Supplementary Figure 6) (34). While the mutations do not prevent pharmacological mTOR inhibition	 a subset protect against the effects of nutrient deprivation on mTORC1 signaling. Lastly	 we demonstrate that cell lines with activating MTOR mutations are particularly sensitive to rapamycin in cell culture and in xenografts	 likely due to mTOR pathway dependency.  The diversity of activating MTOR mutations we characterized is reminiscent of the various activating mutations in the prototypical lipid kinase PIK3CA	 which encodes for the PI3K catalytic subunit p110Î± (35). However	 unlike the activating PIK3CA mutations	 which confer equal activation of PI3K-mediated signaling pathways	 the diverse MTOR mutations can differentially activate mTORC1 or mTORC2	 leading to either S6K1/4EBP1 or Akt1 phosphorylation	 respectively. This finding is particularly relevant in a clinical setting	 as patients with mTORC1 activating mutations may respond well to FDA-approved rapalogs	 while patients with mTORC2 activating mutations might best be treated with ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors	 although such inhibitors are still in clinical trials. This distinction is especially relevant for patients with mTORC2 activating mutations	 because rapalogs can in some cases upregulate mTORC2 signaling through modulation of an mTORC1-dependent feedback loop (36).  Rapalog-based therapies are currently approved or in clinical trials for several cancer subtypes	 and some patients have had dramatic and durable responses to these therapies (37). Given that some cells with activating MTOR mutations are particularly rapamycin sensitive (Figure 4)	 it is possible that some of the rapalog-responsive patients had tumors with similar mutations. Indeed	 it was recently found that the tumor of a bladder cancer patient with two activating MTOR mutations displayed exquisite sensitivity to rapalog-based therapy (38). Many more cancer-associated MTOR mutations will likely be identified in future studies	 but functional evaluation of these mutations will be required to determine their impact on the mTOR pathway. As tumor sequencing becomes more commonplace	 functional studies such as ours may aid in arriving at a more personalized treatment regimen that eventually promotes patient survival.  Go to: Methods Data acquisition and cluster analysis  All mutations in genes of the mTOR pathway were acquired from the cBIO	 COSMIC	 and ICGC databases or through a literature search with a data-freeze date of September 1	 2013. To identify regions of mTOR significantly enriched for somatic point mutations	 we determined the probability of seeing at least the observed number of mutations in a 50 amino acid sliding window with the null hypothesis being all 463 MTOR mutations randomly occurring across the 2549 amino acid protein. Specifically	 we calculated a threshold for significance of at least 15 mutations per 50 amino acids by the formula:  p=âˆ‘n=k463(463k)âˆ—(1âˆ’502549)463âˆ’kâˆ—(502549)k which equals 0.043 for k = at least 15 mutations per 50 amino acids.  Materials  Reagents were obtained from the following sources: antibodies to HA (clone C29F4)	 S6K1 (clone 49D7)	 phospho-T389-S6K1 (clone 108D2)	 and phospho-S473-Akt1 (clone D9E) from Cell Signaling Technology; antibody to GAPDH (clone GT239) from Genetex; antibodies to Deptor and Raptor	 X-ray film	 and PVDF membrane were from Millipore; antibody to Rictor from Bethyl; antibody to the Flag epitope (clone M2)	 Flag M2-coupled agarose beads	 glucose and amino acid mixtures from Sigma; horseradish-peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; FuGENE HD and Cell Titer Glo from Promega; X-tremeGENE 9 and Complete Protease Mixture from Roche Applied Science; QuikChange II XL from Stratagene; enhanced chemiluminescence reagent and glutathione-coupled agarose beads from Thermo; 8-week-old nude mice from Taconic; rapamycin from LC Labs; MLN0128 and GDC0980 from Selleckchem; and Torin1 was synthesized in the Gray laboratory (39). cDNAs for mTOR and PI3K-p110Î± were from Addgene; expression vectors for HAGST-S6K1	 HA-GST-Akt1	 and HA-GST-Rheb1 were described previously (24	40	 41) and Flag-14-3-3Î± was a generous gift from the Yaffe lab. The primers used to generate the mTOR and Rheb1 mutations were from Integrated DNA Technologies and are listed in supplemental table 5. HEK-293T-TREX cell system	 4-12% bis-tris SDS-PAGE gels	 and 20x MOPS buffers were from Invitrogen.  Tissue culture and cell lines  MCF7	 HELA	 HEK-293T	 HCT116	 A375 and SW780 cells were from ATCC; JHUEM7	 MOLT16	 NCIH446	 SNU349	 and TUHR10TKB cells were from the Broad Institute Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia; HEK-293E cells were a generous gift of the Blenis lab; and the HEC59 cells were a generous gift of the Lippard lab. The cell lines have not been re-authenticated	 although those from ATCC and the Broad were used within 6 months of resuscitation. The HEK-293T	 HEK-293E	 HCT116	 A375	 HEC59	 and TUHR10TKB cells were cultured in DMEM; JHUEM7 and MOLT16 cells were cultured in RPMI; and the SW780 cells were cultured in IMDM. All media was prepared with 10% heat inactivated FBS and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin. All cell lines were maintained at 37Â°C	 5% CO2.  Site-directed mutagenesis	 cloning	 and TREX cell line generation  All MTOR and RHEB point mutations were generated in the parental vectors using site-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange II XL kit according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. Primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 5. Point mutations were verified using Sanger sequencing as conducted by Eton Biosciences. The HA-GST-4EBP1 reporter vector was generated by synthesizing a gBlock from IDT encoding for 4EBP1 and cloning it into the pRK5-HA-GST vector using SalI and NotI restriction digestion followed by ligation. WT and mutant mTOR cDNAs were subcloned directly from the pcDNA3 vector into the pcDNA5/FRT/TO vector using single site NotI restriction digestion followed by ligation. Flag-mTOR-expressing TREX cells were generated according to the manufacturer's protocol.  Cell treatments	 lysis	 and immunoprecipitations  For S6K1 and Akt1 co-transfection assays	 3Ã—105 HEK-293T or HEK-293E cells per well were seeded into 6-well tissue culture plates	 transfected 24 hours later with 2 Î¼g of mTOR-encoding plasmid and 1 ng of S6K1- or Akt1-encoding plasmid using X-tremeGENE 9 or FuGENE HD	 followed by whole cell lysis 48 hours after transfection in NP-40 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.5	 150 mM NaCl	 1% NP-40 substitute	 1 mM EDTA at pH8.0	 50 mM NaF	 10 mM Na-pyrophosphate	 15 mM Na3VO4	 100 mM Î²-glycerophosphate	 and 1 tablet of protease inhibitor per 50 mL of buffer). 200-400 Î¼g of whole cell lysates were mixed with 5x SDS-sample buffer to a final concentration of 1-2 Î¼g/Î¼L	 boiled for 5 minutes	 and then used directly for immunoblotting or frozen at âˆ’20Â°C. For glutathione pull down assays	 2Ã—106 HEK-293T cells were seeded onto 10 cm tissue culture plates	 transfected 24 hours later with 10 Î¼g of mTOR-encoding plasmid and 2 ng of S6K1-encoding plasmid using X-tremeGENE 9	 and lysed 48-72 hours after transfection in NP-40 lysis buffer. 2-3 mg of the resultant whole-cell lysates were incubated with 30 Î¼L of pre-washed glutathione-coupled agarose beads in a 1 mL volume	 which were rotated at 4Â°C for two hours	 spun at 2	500 RCF for one minute	 washed in 500 Î¼L lysis buffer three times	 and the beads directly boiled in 50 Î¼L of 2x SDS-sample buffer. For mTOR immunoprecipitations	 the cells were treated as with the glutathione pulldown	 except they were lysed/washed in CHAPS buffer (50 mM HEPES at pH 7.4	 150 mM NaCl	 0.4% CHAPS	 50 mM NaF	 10 mM Na-pyrophosphate	 100 mM Î²-glycerophosphate	 and 1 tablet of protease inhibitor per 50 mL of buffer) and incubated with Flag-M2-coupled agarose beads.  Immunoblotting  10-50 Î¼g of whole cell lysates	 10-30 Î¼L of glutathione pulldown samples	 or 10-30 Î¼L of Flag-M2 immunoprecipitates were loaded into lanes of 4-12% bis-tris SDS-PAGE gels	 run at 120 volts for 2 hours in 1x MOPS buffer	 and then transferred to 0.45 Î¼m PVDF membrane at 60 volts for 2 hours in 1x transfer buffer (100 mM CAPS	 123 mM NaOH	 10% Ethanol). The membranes were then immunoblotted for the indicated proteins. All primary antibodies were diluted 1:1000 in 5% BSA W/V TBST	 with the exception of GAPDH and Flag antibodies which were diluted 1:2000. All secondary antibodies were diluted 1:5000 in 5% milk W/V TBST. Densitometry was performed using ImageJ and a student's T test was used to determine statistical significance.  Rapamycin	 Torin1	 MLN0128	 GDC0980	 and nutrient starvation/re-stimulation treatments  For the mTOR inhibitor experiments	 3Ã—105 TREX cells per well were seeded into 6-well plates	 grown for one day	 treated with 100 nM rapamycin	 250 nM Torin1	 250 nM MLN0128	 250 nM GDC0980	 or DMSO for 60 minutes. The cells were then lysed as above. For the nutrient deprivation experiments	 3Ã—105 TREX cells per well were seeded into 6-well plates	 grown for one day	 rinsed briefly in 1x amino acid- or glucose-free RPMI	 incubated in 1x amino acid- or glucose-free RPMI for 60 minutes	 and then stimulated with free amino acids or glucose to the levels in complete RPMI for 15 minutes.  In vitro proliferation assays  Six replicates each of 800-1200 cells were seeded into 96-well plates	 treated with 8 doses of rapamycin 24 hours later	 and assayed for ATP content using Cell Titer Glo 96 hours following rapamycin treatment according to the manufacturer's protocol.  In vivo xenograft assays  3Ã—106 cells per injection site were implanted subcutaneously into the right and left flanks of nude mice. Once tumors were palpable in all animals (>50 mm3 volume by caliper measurements)	 mice were assigned randomly into rapamycin treated or untreated groups and caliper measurements were taken every 3-4 days until tumor burden approached the limits set by institutional guidelines. Tumor volume was assessed according to the formula (0.5)(W)(W)(L)	 and a student's T test was used to determine the p-values. Rapamycin (4 mg/kg) or vehicle was delivered by daily IP injection	 100 mL per injection. All experiments involving mice were carried out with approval from the Committee for Animal Care at MIT and under supervision of the Department of Comparative Medicine at MIT.   Significance  We report that a diverse set of cancer-associated MTOR mutations confer increased mTORC1/2 pathway activity and that cells harboring these mutations are highly sensitive to rapamycin in culture and in vivo. These findings are clinically relevant as the MTOR mutations characterized herein may serve as biomarkers for predicting tumor responses to mTOR inhibitors.  Rheb	 an activator of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)	 displays low intrinsic GTPase activity favoring the biologically activated	 GTP-bound state. We identified a Rheb mutation (Y35A) that increases its intrinsic nucleotide hydrolysis activity âˆ¼10-fold	 and solved structures of both its active and inactive forms	 revealing an unexpected mechanism of GTP hydrolysis involving Asp65 in switch II and Thr38 in switch I. In the wild-type protein this noncanonical mechanism is markedly inhibited by Tyr35	 which constrains the active site conformation	 restricting the access of the catalytic Asp65 to the nucleotide-binding pocket. Rheb Y35A mimics the enthalpic and entropic changes associated with GTP hydrolysis elicited by the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) TSC2	 and is insensitive to further TSC2 stimulation. Overexpression of Rheb Y35A impaired the regulation of mTORC1 signaling by growth factor availability. We demonstrate that the opposing functions of Tyr35 in the intrinsic and GAP-stimulated GTP catalysis are critical for optimal mTORC1 regulation. ________________________________________ Graphical Abstract   Figure options Highlights â–º Tyr35 autoinhibits intrinsic GTPase activity of Rheb and maintains activation â–º Rheb Y35A efficiently hydrolyzes GTP using Asp65 rather than Gln64 â–º Tyr35 and Asp65 are indispensable for sensitivity of Rheb to TSC2GAP function â–º Regulation of mTORC1 by growth factors depends on Rheb Tyr35 and Asp65 ________________________________________ Introduction Small GTPases act as molecular switches to regulate diverse cellular functions. When bound to guanosine triphosphate (GTP)	 they adopt an â€œonâ€ conformation that elicits a biological response. GTP hydrolysis is accompanied by a conformational change into a GDP-bound â€œoffâ€ conformation. Cycling between the active and inactive states of each GTPase is a result of the intrinsic nucleotide hydrolysis and exchange rates	 and regulatory proteins that catalyze these processes. GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) stimulate GTP hydrolysis	 whereas guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) mediate the displacement of GDP	 allowing a new GTP molecule to bind (Bos et al.	 2007). GTPase proteins possess either complete or partial catalytic machinery for hydrolysis of GTP. In most cases an electronegative group is used for stabilization/polarization of the hydrolytic water for in-line nucleophilic attack of the Î³-phosphate (Li and Zhang	 2004; Maegley et al.	 1996). In most Ras and Rho subfamily GTPases	 this is achieved by the carboxamide oxygen of a conserved Gln in a dynamic loop called switch II. Ras and Rho GAPs work by stabilizing this Gln in a catalytic conformation	 whereas an Arg residue referred to as an â€œArginine fingerâ€ neutralizes the developing negative charge on the Î±- and Î²-phosphates of GTP (Scheffzek et al.	 1997). In other systems	 such as Rap-RapGAP	 a catalytic asparagine is provided in trans by the GAP ( Scrima et al.	 2008). Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb) is a key regulator of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway (Dunlop et al.	 2009; Inoki et al.	 2003). Rheb-GTP promotes phosphorylation of mTORC1 targets	 resulting in enhanced protein translation and cellular growth (Garami et al.	 2003). Rheb has an unusually slow intrinsic GTPase activity	 which is regulated by the GAP activity of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2)	 a tumor suppressor frequently inactivated in human patients with the tumor predisposition syndrome tuberous sclerosis (Garami et al.	 2003; Tee et al.	 2003). Rheb overexpression has been observed in certain cancer cell lines (Eom et al.	 2008; Im et al.	 2002; Nardella et al.	 2008)	 and constitutively activated Rheb mutants can induce oncogenic transformation in cell culture (Jiang and Vogt	 2008). The low intrinsic GTPase activity of Rheb has been attributed to the catalytically incompetent conformation of Gln64 (Yu et al.	 2005)	 which is homologous to Ras Gln61	 but does not participate in GTP hydrolysis (Li et al.	 2004; Marshall et al.	 2009). TSC2GAP is thought to utilize Asn1643 to promote GTP hydrolysis by substituting for Gln64 in an â€œAsn thumbâ€-type mechanism (Inoki et al.	 2003; Marshall et al.	 2009) similar to that of RapGAP (Scrima et al.	 2008). Here	 utilizing site-directed mutagenesis	 crystallography	 and real-time NMR-based GTPase assays	 we discovered that Rheb Tyr35	 a residue that is highly conserved across the small GTPase superfamily (Wennerberg et al.	 2005)	 maintains the high activation state of Rheb by inhibiting intrinsic GTP hydrolysis. Mutation of this residue substantially accelerated intrinsic nucleotide hydrolysis through a catalytic mechanism that did not require Gln64 but also conferred resistance to the activity of TSC2. Crystal structures of Rheb Y35A led us to identify the backbone carbonyl of Thr38 and side chain of Asp65 as candidate residues that contribute to the intrinsic GTPase activity. Mutagenesis studies confirm that Asp65 contributes significantly to the intrinsic GTPase activity of both wild-type (WT) Rheb and the Y35A mutant. Furthermore	 Asp65 was absolutely essential for the sensitivity of Rheb to the GAP activity of TSC2	 whereas Gln64 was dispensable. Consistent with the in vitro data	 expression of Rheb Y35A and D65A mutants in mammalian cells affected transduction of growth factor signals to mTORC1. Taken together	 our observations reveal an efficient noncanonical mechanism of GTP hydrolysis by Rheb and suggest that autoinhibition of catalysis maintains Rheb in its highly activated state upon growth factor stimulation	 which is necessary for the proper signal transduction to mTORC1. Results Rheb Y35 Inhibits Intrinsic GTPase Activity We previously showed that fluorescent-tagged nucleotides can alter the hydrolysis and exchange rates governing the GTPase cycle (Mazhab-Jafari et al.	 2010). The most striking example we observed was that 2â€²-/3â€²-O-(Nâ€²-Methylanthraniloyl) (mant)GTP was hydrolyzed by Rheb âˆ¼10-fold faster than GTP. This is not an intrinsic property of the modified nucleotide because the mant moiety inhibited GTP hydrolysis by RhoA and did not affect hydrolysis by Ras. The rate of mantGTP hydrolysis by Rheb is similar to that of Ras (Figure 1A)	 indicating that Rheb has a latent capacity for efficient catalysis. Interestingly	 however	 the rapid hydrolysis of mantGTP was independent of Rheb Gln64 (Mazhab-Jafari et al.	 2010). The position of the fluorophore in a structure of Ras bound to a nonhydrolyzable analog of mantGTP (Scheidig et al.	 1995) suggested that it may interact with the phenol ring of Tyr35 in switch I of Rheb. Remarkably	 mutation of Tyr35 to Ala recapitulated the mant effect	 increasing the rate of GTP hydrolysis by an order of magnitude (Figure 1B). Furthermore	 the mant tag had no further effect on the catalytic activity of Rheb Y35A	 suggesting that the mutation and the fluorophore stimulate hydrolysis through the same mechanism (Figure 1B). These observations indicate that Tyr35 autoinhibits the intrinsic GTPase activity of Rheb.   Figure 1.  Rapid Hydrolysis of mantGTP by Rheb Is Related to Autoinhibitory Role of Tyr35 (A) Hydrolysis of GTP or mantGTP by Rheb (black and green	 respectively) and Ras (red and blue	 respectively) is shown. Reaction rates derived by curve fitting are presented in the insets. (B) Hydrolysis of GTP by WT Rheb (black)	 and GTP and mantGTP by Rheb Y35A (green and red	 respectively) is presented. Error bars associated with data points in the curves represent SD of the fraction GDP reported by several residues. Error bars in the histograms represent the uncertainty associated with rates derived from curve fitting. See also Figures S1 and S3. Figure options Structural Basis for the Tyr35 Autoinhibitory Function We crystallized GDP-bound Rheb Y35A in the presence of excess GMPPNP (a nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP)	 and to our surprise	 the asymmetric unit contained two molecules of Rheb: one bound to GDP and one to GMPPNP (Figures 2Aâ€“2C; Table 1). The overall protein fold is very similar to WT Rheb (Yu et al.	 2005) (backbone rmsd of 0.44 Ã…) with a few key differences. The nucleotide-binding pocket is completely solvent exposed in the GMPPNP-bound structure of Rheb Y35A	 whereas in the WT protein the triphosphate group of the nucleotide is shielded from the solvent by the phenol ring of Tyr35	 which forms a hydrogen bond with the Î³-phosphate. In addition the Î³-phosphate is 0.5 Ã… closer to Thr38 in the absence of Tyr35 (Figure 2D)	 which in the WT structure â€œpullsâ€ the Î³-phosphate toward the middle of switch I. Interestingly	 the hydrolytic water is closer to the backbone carbonyl of Thr38 in the mutant (2.7 versus 3.8 Ã… in the WT protein) (Figure 2D)	 placing it in a more electron-rich environment that may enhance its polarization for an in-line nucleophilic attack to the Î³-phosphate. It has been proposed that the corresponding backbone carbonyl of Ras (Thr35) contributes to the stabilization/activation of the catalytic water during intrinsic GTP hydrolysis (Buhrman et al.	 2010; Frech et al.	 1994). Comparison of our structure with that of WT Rheb indicates that Tyr35 pulls the Î³-phosphate and catalytic water away from the Thr38 carbonyl	 thus reducing its catalytic contribution.   Figure 2.  Structure and Dynamics of Rheb Y35A (A) Asymmetric unit and electron density of nucleotide substrates are demonstrated. The asymmetric unit of the Rheb Y35A crystal containing one GDP-bound (cyan) and one GMPPNP-bound (green) Rheb molecule is shown in the center. 2Fo-Fc electron density maps at 1.5Ïƒ of the nucleotide-binding site with GMPPNP (left) fitted into one Rheb Y35A molecule and GDP (right) in the second molecule of the crystal asymmetric unit is illustrated.

Table options Switch I of Rheb Y35A does not undergo any substantial conformational change upon nucleotide hydrolysis"	 whereas this region of the WT protein exhibits a large structural change mediated by an interaction between Tyr35 and the Î³-phosphate (Yu et al.	 2005) (Figures 2E and 2F). It was hypothesized that a similar nucleotide-dependent rearrangement of Rap Tyr32 would be energetically unfavorable to the GTPase reaction (Cherfils et al.	 1997)	 consistent with our observation that nucleotide hydrolysis is accelerated by a mutation that disrupts this conformational change. Identification of a Catalytic Residue for GTP Hydrolysis Previous work has shown that Gln64	 corresponding to the catalytic Gln61 of Ras	 is not involved in GTP hydrolysis by WT Rheb (Inoki et al.	 2003; Li et al.	 2004; Marshall et al.	 2009). Likewise	 Gln64 remains in a noncatalytic conformation in the structure of Rheb Y35A (see Figure S1A available online) and is not required for the accelerated hydrolysis of GTP by Rheb Y35A (Figures S1D and S2A). Because the catalytic residues of other small GTPase superfamily members are found in the N terminus of switch II	 we examined this region for residues with electronegative side chains that may contribute to the hydrolytic reaction. Immediately downstream of Gln64 are two residues with acidic side chains: Asp65 and Glu66 (Figure 2G). The crystal structure of Rheb Y35A shows that the backbone of the N-terminal loop of switch II of this mutant is displaced by an average of 1 Ã… toward the nucleotide-binding pocket relative to the WT	 which brings the side-chain carboxylate of Asp65 closer to the nucleotide by 1 Ã…: average Asp65OÎ´1	2WT âˆ’ average Asp65OÎ´1	2Y35A (Figure 2G). Mutation of Asp65 to Ala reduced the intrinsic hydrolysis of Rheb Y35A by more than 60% and that of WT by 30% (Figure 3A)	 as did the conservative substitution of Asp65 by Asn (Figure S2B). On the other hand	 mutations of Glu66 had no effect on intrinsic GTPase activity (Figure S2C)	 consistent with its perpendicular orientation away from the nucleotide (Figure 2G). We also tested all other residues found within 10 Ã… of the hydrolytic water in the Rheb Y35A structure that could potentially provide (1) a negative charge to activate this water molecule	 or (2) a positive charge to stabilize the Î²- and Î³-phosphates in the transition state for hydrolysis (Figure S1). There was no change in the rate of intrinsic nucleotide hydrolysis associated with R15G	 S16A	 or D36A mutations (Figures S1B	 S1C	 and S1E). The only other charged residues within 10 Ã… of the hydrolytic water are Lys19 and Asp60 of the highly conserved G1 and G3 box motifs	 respectively. The Rheb K19A mutant failed to express	 presumably due to impaired nucleotide binding	 and D60A was highly unstable and could not be loaded with GTP	 consistent with the role of this residue in Mg2+ coordination (Yu et al.	 2005). These data strongly suggest that Asp65 is the sole candidate for a catalytic residue in Rheb. Notably	 carboxylates are more potent nucleophiles than carboxamides	 and consistently	 the Q61E substitution increased the GTPase activity of Ras (Frech et al.	 1994).   Figure 3.  Role of Asp65 in Intrinsic and GAP-Mediated GTP Hydrolysis by Rheb (A) Hydrolysis of GTP by WT Rheb (black)	 the mutants D65A and Y35A (blue and green	 respectively)	 as well as the double-mutant Y35A-D65A (red) is illustrated. Reaction rates derived by curve fitting are presented in the insets. (B) Sensitivity of WT Rheb and Asp65 mutants to TSC2GAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis is shown. WT	 WT+GAP	 D65A+GAP	 D65E+GAP	 and D65N+GAP are shown with black	 blue	 green	 yellow	 and red	 respectively. Error bars associated with data points in the curves represent SD of the fraction GDP reported by several residues. Error bars in the histograms represent the uncertainty associated with rates derived from curve fitting. See also Figures S1	 S2	 and S5. Figure options In the structure of WT Rheb	 the carboxylate of Asp65 is 12 Ã… (average Asp65OÎ´1	2) from the Î³-phosphate in a single conformation	 whereas the electron density of Rheb Y35A indicates that Asp65 exists in two conformations	 11.0 and 12.0 Ã… from the Î³-phosphate	 respectively (Figure S1F). By comparison the catalytic carboxamide of Ras (Gln61OÎµ) has been found at distances varying from 4.7 to 12.2 Ã… from the Î³-phosphate (median distance of 8.1Ã…) (Figure S3A) in available crystallographic snapshots	 consistent with the dynamic nature of switch II determined by NMR studies (Ito et al.	 1997). Thus	 despite its established role as a catalytic residue (Frech et al.	 1994)	 Gln61 is rarely found in a catalytically competent conformation in Ras crystal structures	 presumably because this state is transient and energetically unfavorable (Fraser et al.	 2011; Grant et al.	 2009). Similarly	 our Y35A structure and the previous WT Rheb structure (Yu et al.	 2005) both appear to be energetically stable states	 with the conformations of Asp65 stabilized primarily by ionic and polar interactions with the Arg15 and Ser68 side chains	 which are also found in two alternate conformations in our structure (Figure S1F). Interestingly	 comparison of WT and Y35A 1H-15N heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra revealed increased line broadening for residues in the P loop and the N terminus of switch II of GTP-bound Rheb Y35A (Figures 2H and S4A)	 suggesting elevated dynamics in Î¼s-ms timescale. This could allow the N terminus of switch II to sample alternate conformations closer to the nucleotide and the catalytic water. The elevated dynamics of the N-terminal region of switch II and its proximity to the nucleotide-binding site in Rheb Y35A is consistent with the greater impact on catalysis of Asp65 mutations in the Y35A mutant than in WT Rheb (Figure 3A). Hence	 in addition to affecting the orientation of the nucleotide and hydrolytic water	 Tyr35 may reduce the intrinsic GTPase activity of Rheb by restricting the dynamics of switch II and displacing it from the nucleotide-binding site. Relative to Ras	 the catalytic Gln residues of Rho subfamily GTPases were found closer to the Î³-phosphate (median distance of 5.5Ã…) (Figures S3A and S3C)	 which may contribute to their faster intrinsic nucleotide hydrolysis rate (Mazhab-Jafari et al.	 2010). On the other hand	 Gln63	 which was recently proposed to be a noncanonical catalytic residue of Rap in GAP1IP4BP-mediated GTP hydrolysis (Sot et al.	 2010)	 is found with a median distance of 11.8 Ã… from the Î³-phosphate in structures of free Rap (Figure S3A)	 consistent with the slow nucleotide hydrolysis of this GTPase. In Ras	 Gly12	 Gly13	 and Gln61 are the major sites of oncogenic mutations. Mutation of Ras Gly12 to any other residue hinders GTP hydrolysis by sterically occluding access of the catalytic residue Gln61 to the hydrolytic water and nucleotide (Krengel et al.	 1990). However	 Rheb has an Arg in this position	 and its mutation to Gly (R15G) does not increase the catalytic activity of Rheb Y35A (Figure S1E) or WT (Im et al.	 2002; Li et al.	 2004; Marshall et al.	 2009; Yamagata et al.	 1994). The distinctive impact of P loop residues on the activities of Ras and Rheb lends further support to the different molecular mechanisms of action of these two closely related GTPase homologs. Involvement of Rheb's Asp65 and Tyr35 in TSC2GAP-Mediated GTP Hydrolysis Mutation of the solvent-exposed residue Asp65 to Ala (D65A) did not perturb the structure of Rheb	 on the basis of minimal and localized chemical shift perturbations in the 1H-15N HSQC spectra that were mainly confined to switch II (Figure S5)	 but totally abolished the susceptibility of Rheb to the GAP activity of TSC2 (Figure 3B). Furthermore	 even conservative mutations of Asp65 (D65E/N) rendered Rheb totally insensitive to the activity of TSC2GAP. The strict requirement for the geometry and charge of this side chain suggest that it might be a critical catalytic residue for the GAP-mediated hydrolysis reaction. We also tested the sensitivity of the GTPase activity of Rheb Y35A to the action of TSC2GAP and found that the GTPase activity of this mutant was not further stimulated by the addition of the GAP domain of TSC2 (Figure 4A). An analogous mutation (Y32A) impaired the sensitivity of Rap GTPase to the function of RapGAP (Brinkmann et al.	 2002; Scrima et al.	 2008); however	 a conservative mutation (Y32F) was tolerated. Interestingly	 the Y35F mutation was sufficient to render Rheb insensitive to the function of the TSC2GAP (Figure 4B)	 highlighting differences in the details of molecular recognition in these two homologous systems.   Figure 4.  Tyr35 Hydroxyl Is Required for TSC2GAP-Assisted GTP Hydrolysis (A) Intrinsic and GAP-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis by Rheb Y35A is presented. (B) Intrinsic and GAP-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis by Rheb Y35F is demonstrated. In both graphs the GTPase activities of mutant Rheb with and without TSC2GAP are shown in black and green	 respectively	 and the TSC2GAP-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis by WT Rheb is shown in blue. Error bars associated with data points in the curves represent SD of the fraction GDP reported by several residues. Error bars in the histograms represent the uncertainty associated with rates derived from curve fitting. See also Figure S4. Figure options Thermodynamic Basis for the Tyr35 Autoinhibitory Function To better understand the energetic basis of Tyr35 autoinhibition	 we analyzed the thermodynamics of the GTP hydrolysis reaction using an Arrhenius plot (Figure S6). This powerful technique allows one to extract energetic parameters	 such as enthalpy	 entropy	 and free energy	 from the highly unstable and low-populated transition state of an enzymatic reaction. The increased catalytic activity of Rheb Y35A was associated with a large reduction in the activation enthalpy for GTP hydrolysis (Figure S6; Table 2). However	 the activation entropy was also reduced (unfavorable contribution)	 resulting in a modest decrease in the overall activation free energy of the nucleotide hydrolysis reaction in the mutant. Because there is a buildup of negative charge on the Î²-Î³-bridging oxygen during GTP hydrolysis (Allin et al.	 2001; Cepus et al.	 1998; Du et al.	 2000)	 the proximity of the electron-rich phenol ring of Rheb Tyr35 could destabilize the transition state	 which is consistent with the reduction in activation enthalpy associated with mutation of this residue. Interestingly	 the Arg fingers of Ras- and Rho-GAPs accelerate nucleotide hydrolysis of their cognate GTPases by providing positive charge in a position equivalent to that of Rheb Tyr35. Another contribution to the enthalpic term may come from the strengthened hydrogen bond between the Thr38 carbonyl in the mutant and the repositioned catalytic water	 which may be more reactive toward the Î³-phosphate (Frech et al.	" 1994). Table 2.

T is set to 298 K in the equation Î”Gâ€¡ = Î”Hâ€¡ âˆ’ T Î”Sâ€¡. See also Figure S6. a Values from Marshall et al. (2009). Table options The larger negative value of Î”Sâ€¡ for Rheb Y35A indicates that formation of the transition state requires the mutant to undergo a larger increase in â€œorderâ€ than the WT protein. In the crystal structure of WT Rheb-GMPPNP	 a hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl of Tyr35 and the Î³-phosphate of GMPPNP stabilizes switch I	 contributing to the order of the ground state. Disruption of this contact by mutation of Tyr35 increases the disorder in switch I	 as illustrated by partial spectral broadening of peaks from residues 27â€“30 of GTP-bound Rheb Y35A (Figure S4). Thus	 assembly of the ordered transition state from the more flexible Rheb Y35A ground state would be more entropically unfavorable. The conservative mutation Y35F increased intrinsic hydrolysis almost as much as Y35A with similar thermodynamic effects (Figure S6; Table 2)	 suggesting that the H bond between the hydroxyl of Tyr35 and the Î³-phosphate is critical for the autoinhibition of Rheb's GTPase activity. It is very interesting to note that the thermodynamic landscape of intrinsic GTP hydrolysis in the Y35A mutant (reduced activation enthalpy with an entropic penalty) is similar to that reported for TSC2GAP-mediated GTP hydrolysis in WT Rheb (Marshall et al.	 2009)	 suggesting that TSC2GAP may promote hydrolysis in part by disrupting the electrostatic contact between Tyr35 and the Î³-phosphate. Consistent with this hypothesis	 the increased rate of GTP hydrolysis by the Rheb Y35A/Y35F mutants is not further accelerated by the addition of the GAP (Figure 4). The larger reduction of the activation enthalpy by TSC2GAP-mediated catalysis compared to Y35A mutation suggests that the GAP provides additional stimulatory electrostatic contributions to GTP hydrolysis	 perhaps via complementation of the intrinsic catalytic machinery by the Asn thumb. On the other hand the larger unfavorable reduction in entropy of the GAP-mediated reaction could be due to complex formation between Rheb and the GAP domain of TSC2. Mutation of Asp65 substantially impairs the stimulatory effect of the Y35A mutation on intrinsic hydrolysis; hence	 we measured the thermodynamic parameters of the transition state for the Rheb double-mutant Y35A-D65A (Table 2). Mutation of Asp65 increased the activation enthalpy (Î”Hâ€¡) of Rheb Y35A	 indicating that the negatively charged carboxylic acid side chain of Asp65 stabilizes the transition state because the enthalpic term originates primarily from electrostatic interactions (KÃ¶tting and Gerwert	 2004). In Ras the enthalpic contribution to hydrolysis was attributed to the charge shift from the Î³- toward the Î²-phosphate (KÃ¶tting and Gerwert	 2004). We propose that electrostatic interactions between Rheb Asp65 and the nucleotide similarly shift charge in the transition state to promote hydrolysis. Interestingly	 Tyr35 reduces the enthalpic contribution of Asp65 to GTP hydrolysis	 Î”Î”Hâ€¡(Y35A-Y35A	D65A) > Î”Î”Hâ€¡(WT-D65A) (Table 2)	 which is consistent with our kinetic data (Figure 3A). Regulation of mTORC1 by Growth Factors Involves the Noncanonical Catalytic and Autoinhibitory Mechanisms To investigate the role of Rheb's catalytic machinery	 and its autoinhibition	 in the activation of mTORC1	 HeLa cells were transfected with WT Rheb or the Y35A or D65A mutants. Phosphorylation of p70 S6K Thr389	 a measure of mTORC1 signaling throughput (Figure 5A)	 was monitored by immunoblotting	 upon growth factor starvation	 as well as 15 min and 6 hr after growth factor stimulation (Figures 5B and S7). Following growth factor stimulation	 when the TSC1/TSC2 complex is downregulated (Benvenuto et al.	 2000; Chong-Kopera et al.	 2006)	 mutation of Rheb Tyr35 to Ala reduced the activation of mTORC1	 as evidenced by slightly lower p70 S6K phosphorylation despite higher Rheb Y35A expression compared to Rheb WT	 an effect made more apparent with longer stimulation (Figures 5B and S7). Remarkably	 in the absence of stimuli upon serum starvation	 Rheb Y35A led to a significant increase in mTORC1 activity	 as did the expression of the GAP-resistant mutant Rheb D65A (Figure 5B). Mutation of Asp65 (but not Tyr35) perturbed the chemical shift of the neighboring switch II residue Tyr67 (Figures S4A and S5)	 previously shown to be critical for activation of mTORC1 (Long et al.	 2007)	 which may affect the ability of Rheb D65A to fully activate mTORC1. This may explain the fact that under conditions of growth factor stimulation	 Rheb D65A induced less S6K phosphorylation than the WT protein	 despite its reduced intrinsic GTPase activity (Figure 5B).   Figure 5.  Mutations of Rheb Catalytic and Autoinhibitory Residues Impact Rheb's Activation Level and mTORC1 Phosphorylation of p70 S6K (A) Signaling pathway by which growth factors stimulate mTORC1 phosphorylation of p70 S6K is illustrated. (B) Normalized values of p70 S6K phosphorylation for cells starved (âˆ’) or stimulated (+) with serum and insulin for 15 min (left) or 6 hr (right) are shown as bar graphs. The background intensity was used as estimation for the error in the intensity measurements and propagated appropriately throughout division. More details are described in Experimental Procedures. Representative western blots are shown in Figure S7. (C) Rheb nucleotide loading monitored in HEK293 cells with 32P-labeling experiment as described in Experimental Procedures is presented. See also Figure S7. Figure options Guanine nucleotide loading of WT Rheb and the mutants in vivo was determined by their immunoprecipitation from HEK293 cells metabolically labeled with 32P-orthophosphate and nucleotide resolution by thin-layer chromatography (Figure 5C). Consistent with its increased GTPase activity	 Rheb Y35A displayed reduced loading of GTP	 whereas Rheb D65A showed modestly increased GTP loading. Reflected in the elevated loading of WT Rheb with GTP (Figure 5C)	 the overabundance of transfected Rheb proteins likely negates the effects of endogenous TSC2 on the overexpressed Rheb mutants in this cell line. Although the lower GTP loading of Rheb Y35A indicates higher intrinsic hydrolysis rate than that of the WT protein	 modestly increased GTP loading of D65A signifies the autoinhibitory effects of Tyr35 on Asp65's contribution to intrinsic catalysis	 consistent with their in vitro behavior (Figure 3A). Discussion GTPases are versatile molecular switches that utilize surprisingly diverse mechanisms to mediate the interconversion between the active and inactive states. The study presented here illustrates how Rheb evolved a GTP hydrolysis mechanism drastically different from its close homolog H-Ras. Rheb employs an autoinhibitory mechanism to maintain a high activation state in cells essential for the proper maintenance of mTORC1 signaling and cellular growth. The autoinhibitory mechanism functions via an interaction between Rheb Tyr35-OH and the Î³-phosphate of GTP	 which hinders GTP hydrolysis. Interestingly	 our investigation of this inhibitory mechanism led to the elucidation of an unusual Rheb catalytic mechanism involving Asp65	 which is one position downstream of the canonical catalytic Gln	 equivalent to Ras Gln61 and Rho Gln63. In the canonical mechanism the catalytic water is activated/stabilized by interaction with an electronegative group	 the carboxamide oxygen of a glutamine	 provided either in cis or trans ( Bos et al.	 2007). Although an equivalent residue (Gln64) is present in the sequence of Rheb switch II	 our work demonstrates that the catalytic function is carried out by the adjacent Asp65. A Tyr residue in switch I is highly conserved among the GTPase superfamily; however	 the functional role of this residue varies. For example in RhoA	 Tyr34 stimulates intrinsic hydrolysis	 presumably by stabilizing the catalytic conformation of Gln63 in switch II	 whereas Ras Tyr32 is solvent exposed and does not impact the intrinsic hydrolysis (Figure S3). In Rheb	 Tyr35 counters the contribution of Asp65 to catalysis by restricting the dynamics of switch II and reducing its access to the catalytic site (Figure 6). Severe peak broadening was observed for the amides of Gly63	 Gln64	 Asp65	 and Glu66 in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the Y35A mutant (Figure 2H)	 presumably the result of disrupting the H bond network from Tyr35 to the amide of Gly63 through the catalytic water and the Î³-phosphate (Figure 2D). Moreover	 Tyr35 restricts the position of the hydrolytic water and reduces its polarization by the carbonyl of Thr38	 which is thought to promote hydrolysis (Buhrman et al.	 2010; Frech et al.	 1994). The residual catalytic activity found in Rheb D65A may reflect the stimulatory effect of the Thr38 backbone carbonyl in polarization and/or stabilization of the hydrolytic water. Upon mutation of Tyr35	 Asp65 adopts two conformations	 one of which is more proximal (relative to the WT) to the nucleotide-binding site and appears better positioned for hydrolysis (Figure 2G)	 consistent with our finding that mutation of Asp65 has a greater impact on the catalytic activity of Rheb Y35A than that of WT (Figure 3A). On the basis of the multiple crystallographic conformations of Asp65	 and the NMR peak broadening	 we propose that in both WT and Y35A Rheb	 switch II exists in an ensemble of conformations	 some of which allow Asp65 to adopt a catalytic conformation closer to the nucleotide.   Figure 6.  Schematic Model of Intrinsic and TSC2GAP-Stimulated GTP Hydrolysis by Rheb (A) In WT Rheb	 Tyr35 displaces the hydrolytic water away from the backbone carbonyl of Thr38	 reducing the polarization and reactivity of this water molecule. Furthermore	 Tyr35 reduces the electrostatic contribution of Asp65 to the GTP hydrolysis reaction by displacing this residue away from the nucleotide and the catalytic water. (B) Mutation of Tyr35 allows Asp65 and Thr38 to assemble a more efficient catalytic site. (C) Interaction of the GAP domain of TSC2 with Rheb may reduce the inhibitory effects of Tyr35	 allowing Asp65 to promote catalysis in synergy with the Asn thumb (Asn1643) provided in trans by TSC2GAP. See also Figure S6. Figure options Structural evidence implicating Asp as a catalytic residue exists for at least one other member of the GTPase superfamily	 the signal recognition particle (SRP) Ffh/FtsY (Focia et al.	 2004)	 which is a large dimeric prokaryotic GTPase that is highly divergent from the Ras family. Nevertheless	 to our knowledge	 a catalytic Asp has not been previously reported within the Ras subfamily. On the other hand the inhibitory role for a switch I Tyr we discovered in Rheb may be relevant in inhibiting the intrinsic hydrolytic machinery in certain other GTPases	 such as Ran (Brucker et al.	 2010). Our structural analysis of Rheb also shed further light on the mechanism of TSC2GAP-mediated hydrolysis of GTP. We propose that whereas providing an Asn thumb as a means of accelerating catalysis	 TSC2GAP may also stimulate the GTPase activity of Rheb by relieving autoinhibition and aligning Rheb's catalytic machinery (Figure 6C). Interaction of TSC2 with Rheb switch I may disrupt the electrostatic contact between Tyr35 and the Î³-phosphate	 reducing the autoinhibitory effect of this residue on GTP hydrolysis	 explaining the functional and thermodynamic similarities between WT Rheb in the presence of the TSC2GAP and the Rheb Y35A mutant alone. A common theme in GAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis is repositioning of the N terminus of switch II relative to the nucleotide-binding site to allow for efficient catalysis. For example the RanGAP Asn thumb serves to properly orient the catalytic Gln69 of Ran (Bos et al.	 2007; Seewald et al.	 2002). Similarly	 GAPIP4BP has been proposed to promote Rap GTP hydrolysis by repositioning a noncanonical catalytic glutamine residue	 Gln63	 located two positions C terminal to the position corresponding to Ras Gln61 (Sot et al.	 2010). In the case of Rheb	 we propose that Rheb-TSC2GAP interaction stabilizes Asp65 closer to the Î³-phosphate to catalyze GTP hydrolysis in synergy with the Asn thumb (Asn1643) provided by TSC2GAP. The delineation of the precise details of TSC2-mediated catalysis will require a more detailed structural analysis of the Rheb:TSC2GAP complex that is hindered by the transient nature of their interaction observed by us and others (Marshall et al.	 2009; Scrima et al.	 2008)	 preventing us from distinguishing impaired binding from impaired catalysis. The Tyr35-mediated autoinhibition of Rheb's GTPase reaction is necessary to maintain the appropriate level of activation of this small GTPase	 and thus mTORC1 signaling	 in response to growth factors. When growth factors are available	 TSC2GAP activity becomes limiting	 and Tyr35 inhibits GTP hydrolysis	 resulting in mTORC1 upregulation. In the absence of stimulation	 Rheb Tyr35 is required for productive TSC2GAP-mediated acceleration of GTP hydrolysis to shut down mTORC1 signaling. Indeed	 overexpression of Rheb Y35A substantially uncouples mTOR signaling from growth factors. In cells overexpressing WT Rheb	 mTOR signaling was strongly responsive to the availability of serum and insulin	 whereas this response was significantly dampened in cells overexpressing the Y35A mutant. To our knowledge	 this is the first example of a distinct mechanism of intrinsic nucleotide hydrolysis within the Ras subfamily	 which may be relevant to some other Ras superfamily GTPases	 particularly those that lack the canonical catalytic Gln in switch II (e.g.	 Rap GTPases). This study provides a view into an unusual mechanism of GTP hydrolysis by Rheb and an intriguing autoinhibitory interaction that blocks this GTPase reaction.    																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						
7	68||Genes encoding components of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling axis are frequently mutated in cancer	 but few mutations have been characterized in MTOR	 the gene for the mTOR kinase. Using publicly available tumor genome sequencing data	 we generated a comprehensive catalog of mTOR pathway mutations in cancer	 identifying 33 MTOR mutations that confer pathway hyperactivation. The mutations cluster in six distinct regions in the C-terminal half of mTOR and occur in multiple cancer types	 with one cluster particularly prominent in kidney cancer. The activating mutations do not affect mTOR complex assembly	 but a subset reduces binding to the mTOR inhibitor Deptor. mTORC1 signaling in cells expressing various activating mutations remains sensitive to pharmacological mTOR inhibition	 but is partially resistant to nutrient deprivation. Lastly	 cancer cell lines with hyperactivating MTOR mutations display heightened sensitivity to rapamycin both in culture and as in vivo xenografts	 suggesting that such mutations confer mTOR pathway dependency.  Keywords: personalized	 mTOR	 mutations	 biomarker	 deptor Go to: Introduction In mammals	 the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway regulates cell size	 mRNA translation	 autophagy and many metabolic processes	 including lipid synthesis (1). A variety of upstream regulators control the activity of the serine/threonine protein kinase mTOR and many of these are deregulated in cancer	 resulting in pathway hyperactivation. Such activation occurs most commonly through loss-of-function mutations in tumor suppressors	 such as phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)	 tuberous sclerosis 1/2 (TSC1/2)	 neurofibromin 1/2 (NF1/2)	 or oncogenic mutations in KRAS	 PIK3CA	 or AKT (2). However	 few cancer-associated mutations have been functionally characterized in MTOR itself	 with only two reports thus far describing such mutations. In the first report	 the authors tested six cancer-associated MTOR mutations and observed that two (S2215Y from a colorectal sample and R2505P from a kidney sample) conferred mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activation (3). In the second report	 the authors identified an mTORC1 activating MTOR mutation (L2431P) that was present in a portion but not the entirety of a primary kidney tumor (4). Although these initial reports establish that activating MTOR mutations do arise in cancer	 they were based upon limited sample sets that do not reflect the diverse subtypes of cancer. More recently	 cancer genome sequencing projects	 such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE)	 have identified a vast number of somatic mutations in thousands of tumors from more than 40 cancer subtypes (5-7).  Using publicly available databases of cancer genome sequence data	 we cataloged all mutations in mTOR pathway components. We annotated over 400 samples with missense mutations in the MTOR gene from dozens of cancer subtypes	 most of which lie within six clusters in the part of the gene that encodes the C-terminal portion of mTOR. Furthermore	 through functional analyses	 we identify 33 novel mTOR pathway-activating mutations	 some of which affect the capacity of mTOR to interact with its partner proteins. None of the activating mutations impact the sensitivity of mTORC1 activity in cells to mTOR inhibitors but a subset confer mTORC1 signaling resistance to nutrient deprivation. Importantly	 cancer cells that naturally express a subset of the mutations are hypersensitive to the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. These findings may have translational relevance as rapamycin analogs (rapalogs) are clinically approved for the treatment of cancer	 and several ATP-competitive mTOR kinase inhibitors are in development (8). As tumor biopsies are increasingly subjected to whole exome sequencing	 the hyperactivating MTOR mutations we characterize may serve as biomarkers in predicting cancer response to mTOR-targeting drugs.  Go to: Results Catalog of recurring mutations in genes encoding mTOR pathway components  To generate a comprehensive catalog of all cancer-associated missense mutations in canonical genes of the mTOR pathway	 we analyzed partial genome sequencing data from the TCGA	 CCLE	 International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) databases (5-7	9	 10). This analysis revealed that almost every gene in the mTOR pathway harbored somatic point mutations (Supplementary Table 1). To enrich for mutations that are more likely to affect pathway function	 only mutations that alter the same codon more than once were counted. When normalized for gene length	 this analysis revealed that MTOR contained the highest percentage of recurring mutations	 and thus we focused most of our attention on these mutations (Supplementary Figure 1). Collectively	 through data mining and a literature search	 we curated over 400 samples with non-synonymous MTOR point mutations (Figure 1B and Supplementary Table 2) (11-17). While the majority of these mutations are represented by only one sample in our database	 approximately 40% are recurrent	 most of which have not been previously described. Additionally	 the mutations cluster in six distinct regions of mTOR centered on highly recurrent mutations that alter amino acids C1483	 E1799	 T1977	 S2215	 L2427 and R2505 (Figure 1C). The presence of these clusters suggests that there is a selective advantage to acquiring mutations in certain regions of the mTOR protein. Furthermore	 these mutations are present in multiple cancer subtypes	 with the highest number in colorectal	 endometrial	 and lung cancers	 although these cancer subtypes are also considered to have the highest mutation rates (Figures 1D and 1E) (18). Interestingly	 a random mutagenesis screen in the S. pombe mTOR homolog (tor2) identified activating mutations in homologous amino acid positions to many of those we find in MTOR to be recurrently mutated in cancer (19) (Supplementary Table 3).  Figure 1 Figure 1 Cancer-associated MTOR mutations mTORC1/2 activating mutations in MTOR  The prevalence of the recurrent mutations	 their clustering	 and correlation with activating tor2 mutations strongly suggested that the MTOR mutations impact mTOR pathway activity. To test this possibility	 wild-type (WT) or ten different mutants of mTOR (L1460P	 C1483F	 E1799K	 F1888L	 T1977R	 V2006I	 S2215Y	 I2500F	 R2505P	 and D2512H) were expressed in cells and phosphorylation of the mTORC1/2 substrates S6K1	 4EBP1	 or Akt1 examined (Figures 2A	 2B	 and 2C). All the mTOR mutants conferred varying degrees of pathway activation	 and	 interestingly	 a few displayed some substrate preference (L1460P	 C1483F	 S2215Y	 and R2505P towards S6K1/4EBP1 or V2006I towards Akt1)	 implying that these mutations have greater effects on mTORC1 or mTORC2. Thus	 while three pathway activating MTOR mutations have previously been identified (3	 4)	 our initial analyses uncovered an additional eight recurrent MTOR mutations which activate mTORC1 and/or mTORC2.  Figure 2 Figure 2 mTORC1 and mTORC2 activating mutations in MTOR and RHEB It is well established that two activating mutations (E545K and H1047R) within the phosphatidylinositol-4	5-bisphosphate 3-kinase	 catalytic subunit alpha (PI3K-p110Î±)	 encoded by the PIK3CA gene	 can lead to mTOR pathway activation (20). To determine the degree of mTOR pathway activation conferred by mTOR mutation	 S6K1 phosphorylation from cells expressing WT or S2215Y mTOR was compared to cells expressing WT or mutant PI3K-p110Î± (Supplementary Figures 2A and 2B). This revealed that while expression of only mutant mTOR conferred mTORC1 activation	 expression of either WT or mutant PI3K-p110Î± induced mTORC1 activity.  Non-recurrent MTOR mutations that activate mTORC1 signaling  We next examined in more detail the nature of the activating MTOR mutations	 and observed that while some codons are mutated to only one other residue (e.g. E1799K)	 others are mutated to several different amino acids (e.g. S2215F/P/T/Y). This is reminiscent of the diverse amino acids to which the G12 residue of KRAS is mutated in cancers (21). We expressed 20 such MTOR mutations and found that many (C1483R/W/Y	 F1888I	 T1977K	 S2215F/P	 I2500M)	 but not all (A41P/S/T	 F1888V	 T1977S	 V2006L	 S2215T	 R2505Q/*	 D2512G/Y)	 led to increased S6K1 phosphorylation (Supplementary Figures 3 and 5	 and data not shown). Given that most of these activating mutations are found only once in our dataset implies that other non-recurrent mutations may also activate mTORC1 signaling. To identify other such mutations	 we turned our attention to the mutational clusters identified in Figure 1	 and observed that while most are represented by several tissue types	 those in the C1483 cluster are particularly prevalent in kidney cancer (Figure 1E and Supplementary Figure 3D). Interestingly	 two recent cancer genome sequencing efforts reported that kidney cancers have an increased percentage of mutations in mTOR pathway genes	 but the functional consequences of these mutations were not evaluated (13	 22). Expression of the ten kidney cancer-associated MTOR mutations from the C1483 cluster revealed that in addition to the previously evaluated L1460P and C1483F/Y mutants (Figure 1B and Supplemental Figure 2)	 three non-recurrent mutants (L1433S	 A1459P	 and E1519T) also induced mTORC1 pathway activity (Figure 2D). Similarly	 expression of eight non-recurrent mutations from the S2215 cluster (N2206S	 L2209V	 A2210P	 L2216P	 R2217W	 L2220F	 Q2223K	 and A2226S) activated mTORC1 signaling as measured by S6K1 phosphorylation	 with the L2209V mutant conferring higher activation than even S2215Y (Supplementary Figure 3E). Lastly	 other than the S2215Y and R2505P mutations	 the only other cancer-associated MTOR mutation previously characterized is L2431P from a kidney cancer patient (4). Expression of mTOR containing this non-recurrent mutation caused mTORC1 activation that was much weaker than that caused by expression of the S2215Y mutant (Supplementary Figure 3F). Collectively	 these results suggest that while most non-recurrent MTOR mutations found in cancer are part of the mutational â€œnoiseâ€	 there exists a diverse set of MTOR mutations that can drive mTORC1 pathway activity. Likely	 as more cancer genomes are sequenced	 the activating non-recurrent mutations we identified will prove to be recurrent.  Recurrent mutations in RHEB activate mTORC1  We also observed that other mTOR pathway genes such as Raptor	 Rictor	 and Rheb1 harbored recurrent mutations (Supplemental Table 1). Expression of Rheb1 Y35N/C/H and to a lesser degree E139K increased phosphorylation of endogenous S6K1 more than that of WT Rheb1 (Figure 2E)	 while recurrent mutations in Raptor (R788C) or Rictor (S1101L) failed to induce any mTORC1 or mTORC2 activity (data not shown). In support of the relevance of these mutations to cancer	 RHEB was recently highlighted as a novel cancer gene due to the presence of the Y35N mutation (23). Thus	 cancer associated mutations in either MTOR or RHEB can induce mTORC1 activity; whether this is true of other mTOR pathway genes remains to be determined.  mTORC1/2 hyperactivating mutants bind less Deptor  One potential mechanism through which the mutations in mTOR (Figure 2) might increase S6K1/Akt1 phosphorylation is by altering mTORC1 or mTORC2 assembly. Alternatively or in addition	 the mTOR mutations may diminish the binding of mTOR to its endogenous inhibitor Deptor	 which binds to the FAT domain of mTOR (24). To test these possibilities	 the interactions of exogenously expressed WT or mutant mTORs with endogenous Raptor	 Rictor	 and Deptor were measured. All mutant mTOR proteins bound equally well to Raptor and Rictor	 suggesting that the mutations do not affect formation of either mTOR complex (Figure 3A). In contrast	 Deptor binding to the immunoprecipitated mTOR proteins was reduced in cells expressing the mTOR mutants as compared to WT mTOR (Figure 3A). Given that increased mTOR pathway activity correlates with a reduction in the mTOR-Deptor interaction (24)	 it is likely that the observed decrease in Deptor binding reflects the increased mTOR pathway activity caused by the MTOR mutations. However	 two mTORC1 activating mutations that are in the FAT domain of mTOR	 L1460P and C1483Y	 bound much less Deptor than the other mutants tested (Figure 3A)	 suggesting that these mutations directly perturb the Deptor binding site on mTOR. Consistent with this	 examination of the mutations from the C1483 cluster described in figure 2D revealed that two other highly activating mutations in the FAT domain (A1459P and C1483Y) also strongly reduced the mTOR-Deptor interaction (Supplementary Figure 4A). While these results suggest a possible mechanism of action for a subset of activating mTOR mutations	 they do not preclude other mechanism by which MTOR mutations may impact mTORC1 signaling	 such as by increasing the activity of the mTOR kinase domain.  Figure 3 Figure 3 mTOR mutants bind less Deptor and cells expressing the mTOR S2215Y mutation are resistant to nutrient deprivation MTOR mutations do not affect mTORC1 sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors but can affect the pathway response to nutrient deprivation  We next considered the possibility that the mTORC1-activating MTOR mutants have altered sensitivity to established mTOR inhibitors. Engineered mutations in the FRB domain of mTOR	 which binds the FKBP12-rapamycin complex	 confer marked rapamycin resistance to mTOR (25). To test whether mTOR mutation alters pathway inhibition by rapamycin or Torin1 (an investigational ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor)	 we used HEK-293 cells with an integrated FLP recombination site (TREX cells) to stably express WT or several different mutants of mTOR (A1459P	 C1483Y	 E1799K	 F1888I	 L2209V	 S2215Y	 L2431P	 I2500F	 and R2505P)	 as the mTOR cDNA is too large to be packaged and expressed via a lentiviral delivery system (Supplementary Figure 4B). Baseline phosphorylation of endogenous S6K1 was higher in TREX cells expressing the A1459P	 L2209V	 S2215Y	 I2500F and R2505P mTOR mutants than in parental or WT-expressing cells (Figure 3B and Supplementary Figures 4C and 4D)	 consistent with the results obtained upon transient expression of these mutants (Figures 2A and 2D	 and Supplementary Figure 3D). Importantly	 mTORC1 activity in none of the TREX cells was resistant to rapamycin	 Torin1	 MLN0128 (an mTOR ATP-competitive inhibitor)	 GDC0980 (a dual PI3K/mTOR ATP-competitive inhibitor)	 (Figure 3B and Supplementary Figures 4C and 4D). Thus	 on a molecular level	 while cells with mTOR mutations may display high levels of mTORC1/2 activity	 this activity is still sensitive to pharmacological mTOR inhibition.  The kinase activity of mTOR is tightly regulated by nutrient availability; when cells are starved of nutrients (specifically glucose and amino acids)	 they downregulate mTORC1 signaling	 while retreatment of cells with these nutrients restores mTORC1-mediated signaling (26). Given this	 we sought to determine whether any of the activating mTOR mutants affect the sensitivity of mTORC1 signaling to amino acid or glucose withdrawal. Indeed	 S6K1 phosphorylation was highly resistant to deprivation of either nutrient in cells expressing several mutants (A1459P	 S2215Y	 I2500F and R2505P) (Figure 3C and Supplementary Figures 4E and 4F). This observation may be relevant in the context of developing tumors	 which are often glucose starved (27	 28)	 where inappropriate mTORC1 activity may provide a growth advantage.  Cancer cells with hyperactivating MTOR mutations are hypersensitive to rapamycin in vitro and in vivo  To determine if cancer cells with MTOR mutations are dependent on mTORC1 activity	 we evaluated the impact of rapamycin on the proliferation of set of cancer cell lines harboring WT or mutant mTOR (Figure 4A). We identified four cell lines with mTORC1-activating MTOR mutations (C1483Y in MOLT16; E1799K in HEC59 and SNU349; and S2215Y in JHUEM7) and two with MTOR mutations that have no apparent impact on mTORC1 signaling (V2006L in TUHR10TKB; and R2152C in A375) (Supplementary Figures 5A and 5B). HeLa cells were used as a negative control cell line	 as they are mildly rapamycin sensitive and are wild-type for mTOR (7	 29). MCF7 and SW780 cells	 which are also wild-type for mTOR	 served as positive controls for rapamycin sensitivity because the MCF7 cells harbor an activating PI3K-p110Î± mutation (E545K) while the SW780 cells lack NPRL2	 which encodes a component of the GATOR1 negative regulator of the amino acid-sensing pathway (30	 31). Importantly	 only the cell lines with activating MTOR mutations	 the PI3K-p110Î± mutant	 or the NPRL2-null SW780 cells were hypersensitive to rapamycin treatment (Figure 4B). Consistent with these and published results	 the growth of HeLa xenografts was partially rapamycin sensitive	 while rapamycin completely halted the growth of HEC59 xenografts	 which carry the hyperactivating mTOR E1799K mutation (Figure 4C) (32	 33). These results suggest that the presence of hyperactivating MTOR mutations in cancer cells may serve as biomarkers to identify tumors that are likely to respond to mTOR inhibitors.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Rapamycin inhibits the proliferation of cancer cell lines with hyperactivating MTOR mutations Go to: Discussion Early cancer genome sequencing projects led to the identification of three mutations in MTOR that were shown to activate mTORC1 signaling (3	 4). Here	 we have identified an additional 33 previously unknown activating MTOR mutations (some are recurrent	 others are not) (Supplementary Table 4). Mechanistically	 we find that the activating mutations diminish the mTOR-Deptor interaction and interestingly	 when mapped onto the recently solved crystal structure of mTOR	 the mutations cluster in several distinct locations within the protein itself	 suggesting that other activating mechanisms may exist (Supplementary Figure 6) (34). While the mutations do not prevent pharmacological mTOR inhibition	 a subset protect against the effects of nutrient deprivation on mTORC1 signaling. Lastly	 we demonstrate that cell lines with activating MTOR mutations are particularly sensitive to rapamycin in cell culture and in xenografts	 likely due to mTOR pathway dependency.  The diversity of activating MTOR mutations we characterized is reminiscent of the various activating mutations in the prototypical lipid kinase PIK3CA	 which encodes for the PI3K catalytic subunit p110Î± (35). However	 unlike the activating PIK3CA mutations	 which confer equal activation of PI3K-mediated signaling pathways	 the diverse MTOR mutations can differentially activate mTORC1 or mTORC2	 leading to either S6K1/4EBP1 or Akt1 phosphorylation	 respectively. This finding is particularly relevant in a clinical setting	 as patients with mTORC1 activating mutations may respond well to FDA-approved rapalogs	 while patients with mTORC2 activating mutations might best be treated with ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors	 although such inhibitors are still in clinical trials. This distinction is especially relevant for patients with mTORC2 activating mutations	 because rapalogs can in some cases upregulate mTORC2 signaling through modulation of an mTORC1-dependent feedback loop (36).  Rapalog-based therapies are currently approved or in clinical trials for several cancer subtypes	 and some patients have had dramatic and durable responses to these therapies (37). Given that some cells with activating MTOR mutations are particularly rapamycin sensitive (Figure 4)	 it is possible that some of the rapalog-responsive patients had tumors with similar mutations. Indeed	 it was recently found that the tumor of a bladder cancer patient with two activating MTOR mutations displayed exquisite sensitivity to rapalog-based therapy (38). Many more cancer-associated MTOR mutations will likely be identified in future studies	 but functional evaluation of these mutations will be required to determine their impact on the mTOR pathway. As tumor sequencing becomes more commonplace	 functional studies such as ours may aid in arriving at a more personalized treatment regimen that eventually promotes patient survival.  Go to: Methods Data acquisition and cluster analysis  All mutations in genes of the mTOR pathway were acquired from the cBIO	 COSMIC	 and ICGC databases or through a literature search with a data-freeze date of September 1	 2013. To identify regions of mTOR significantly enriched for somatic point mutations	 we determined the probability of seeing at least the observed number of mutations in a 50 amino acid sliding window with the null hypothesis being all 463 MTOR mutations randomly occurring across the 2549 amino acid protein. Specifically	 we calculated a threshold for significance of at least 15 mutations per 50 amino acids by the formula:  p=âˆ‘n=k463(463k)âˆ—(1âˆ’502549)463âˆ’kâˆ—(502549)k which equals 0.043 for k = at least 15 mutations per 50 amino acids.  Materials  Reagents were obtained from the following sources: antibodies to HA (clone C29F4)	 S6K1 (clone 49D7)	 phospho-T389-S6K1 (clone 108D2)	 and phospho-S473-Akt1 (clone D9E) from Cell Signaling Technology; antibody to GAPDH (clone GT239) from Genetex; antibodies to Deptor and Raptor	 X-ray film	 and PVDF membrane were from Millipore; antibody to Rictor from Bethyl; antibody to the Flag epitope (clone M2)	 Flag M2-coupled agarose beads	 glucose and amino acid mixtures from Sigma; horseradish-peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; FuGENE HD and Cell Titer Glo from Promega; X-tremeGENE 9 and Complete Protease Mixture from Roche Applied Science; QuikChange II XL from Stratagene; enhanced chemiluminescence reagent and glutathione-coupled agarose beads from Thermo; 8-week-old nude mice from Taconic; rapamycin from LC Labs; MLN0128 and GDC0980 from Selleckchem; and Torin1 was synthesized in the Gray laboratory (39). cDNAs for mTOR and PI3K-p110Î± were from Addgene; expression vectors for HAGST-S6K1	 HA-GST-Akt1	 and HA-GST-Rheb1 were described previously (24	40	 41) and Flag-14-3-3Î± was a generous gift from the Yaffe lab. The primers used to generate the mTOR and Rheb1 mutations were from Integrated DNA Technologies and are listed in supplemental table 5. HEK-293T-TREX cell system	 4-12% bis-tris SDS-PAGE gels	 and 20x MOPS buffers were from Invitrogen.  Tissue culture and cell lines  MCF7	 HELA	 HEK-293T	 HCT116	 A375 and SW780 cells were from ATCC; JHUEM7	 MOLT16	 NCIH446	 SNU349	 and TUHR10TKB cells were from the Broad Institute Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia; HEK-293E cells were a generous gift of the Blenis lab; and the HEC59 cells were a generous gift of the Lippard lab. The cell lines have not been re-authenticated	 although those from ATCC and the Broad were used within 6 months of resuscitation. The HEK-293T	 HEK-293E	 HCT116	 A375	 HEC59	 and TUHR10TKB cells were cultured in DMEM; JHUEM7 and MOLT16 cells were cultured in RPMI; and the SW780 cells were cultured in IMDM. All media was prepared with 10% heat inactivated FBS and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin. All cell lines were maintained at 37Â°C	 5% CO2.  Site-directed mutagenesis	 cloning	 and TREX cell line generation  All MTOR and RHEB point mutations were generated in the parental vectors using site-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange II XL kit according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. Primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 5. Point mutations were verified using Sanger sequencing as conducted by Eton Biosciences. The HA-GST-4EBP1 reporter vector was generated by synthesizing a gBlock from IDT encoding for 4EBP1 and cloning it into the pRK5-HA-GST vector using SalI and NotI restriction digestion followed by ligation. WT and mutant mTOR cDNAs were subcloned directly from the pcDNA3 vector into the pcDNA5/FRT/TO vector using single site NotI restriction digestion followed by ligation. Flag-mTOR-expressing TREX cells were generated according to the manufacturer's protocol.  Cell treatments	 lysis	 and immunoprecipitations  For S6K1 and Akt1 co-transfection assays	 3Ã—105 HEK-293T or HEK-293E cells per well were seeded into 6-well tissue culture plates	 transfected 24 hours later with 2 Î¼g of mTOR-encoding plasmid and 1 ng of S6K1- or Akt1-encoding plasmid using X-tremeGENE 9 or FuGENE HD	 followed by whole cell lysis 48 hours after transfection in NP-40 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.5	 150 mM NaCl	 1% NP-40 substitute	 1 mM EDTA at pH8.0	 50 mM NaF	 10 mM Na-pyrophosphate	 15 mM Na3VO4	 100 mM Î²-glycerophosphate	 and 1 tablet of protease inhibitor per 50 mL of buffer). 200-400 Î¼g of whole cell lysates were mixed with 5x SDS-sample buffer to a final concentration of 1-2 Î¼g/Î¼L	 boiled for 5 minutes	 and then used directly for immunoblotting or frozen at âˆ’20Â°C. For glutathione pull down assays	 2Ã—106 HEK-293T cells were seeded onto 10 cm tissue culture plates	 transfected 24 hours later with 10 Î¼g of mTOR-encoding plasmid and 2 ng of S6K1-encoding plasmid using X-tremeGENE 9	 and lysed 48-72 hours after transfection in NP-40 lysis buffer. 2-3 mg of the resultant whole-cell lysates were incubated with 30 Î¼L of pre-washed glutathione-coupled agarose beads in a 1 mL volume	 which were rotated at 4Â°C for two hours	 spun at 2	500 RCF for one minute	 washed in 500 Î¼L lysis buffer three times	 and the beads directly boiled in 50 Î¼L of 2x SDS-sample buffer. For mTOR immunoprecipitations	 the cells were treated as with the glutathione pulldown	 except they were lysed/washed in CHAPS buffer (50 mM HEPES at pH 7.4	 150 mM NaCl	 0.4% CHAPS	 50 mM NaF	 10 mM Na-pyrophosphate	 100 mM Î²-glycerophosphate	 and 1 tablet of protease inhibitor per 50 mL of buffer) and incubated with Flag-M2-coupled agarose beads.  Immunoblotting  10-50 Î¼g of whole cell lysates	 10-30 Î¼L of glutathione pulldown samples	 or 10-30 Î¼L of Flag-M2 immunoprecipitates were loaded into lanes of 4-12% bis-tris SDS-PAGE gels	 run at 120 volts for 2 hours in 1x MOPS buffer	 and then transferred to 0.45 Î¼m PVDF membrane at 60 volts for 2 hours in 1x transfer buffer (100 mM CAPS	 123 mM NaOH	 10% Ethanol). The membranes were then immunoblotted for the indicated proteins. All primary antibodies were diluted 1:1000 in 5% BSA W/V TBST	 with the exception of GAPDH and Flag antibodies which were diluted 1:2000. All secondary antibodies were diluted 1:5000 in 5% milk W/V TBST. Densitometry was performed using ImageJ and a student's T test was used to determine statistical significance.  Rapamycin	 Torin1	 MLN0128	 GDC0980	 and nutrient starvation/re-stimulation treatments  For the mTOR inhibitor experiments	 3Ã—105 TREX cells per well were seeded into 6-well plates	 grown for one day	 treated with 100 nM rapamycin	 250 nM Torin1	 250 nM MLN0128	 250 nM GDC0980	 or DMSO for 60 minutes. The cells were then lysed as above. For the nutrient deprivation experiments	 3Ã—105 TREX cells per well were seeded into 6-well plates	 grown for one day	 rinsed briefly in 1x amino acid- or glucose-free RPMI	 incubated in 1x amino acid- or glucose-free RPMI for 60 minutes	 and then stimulated with free amino acids or glucose to the levels in complete RPMI for 15 minutes.  In vitro proliferation assays  Six replicates each of 800-1200 cells were seeded into 96-well plates	 treated with 8 doses of rapamycin 24 hours later	 and assayed for ATP content using Cell Titer Glo 96 hours following rapamycin treatment according to the manufacturer's protocol.  In vivo xenograft assays  3Ã—106 cells per injection site were implanted subcutaneously into the right and left flanks of nude mice. Once tumors were palpable in all animals (>50 mm3 volume by caliper measurements)	 mice were assigned randomly into rapamycin treated or untreated groups and caliper measurements were taken every 3-4 days until tumor burden approached the limits set by institutional guidelines. Tumor volume was assessed according to the formula (0.5)(W)(W)(L)	 and a student's T test was used to determine the p-values. Rapamycin (4 mg/kg) or vehicle was delivered by daily IP injection	 100 mL per injection. All experiments involving mice were carried out with approval from the Committee for Animal Care at MIT and under supervision of the Department of Comparative Medicine at MIT.   Significance  We report that a diverse set of cancer-associated MTOR mutations confer increased mTORC1/2 pathway activity and that cells harboring these mutations are highly sensitive to rapamycin in culture and in vivo. These findings are clinically relevant as the MTOR mutations characterized herein may serve as biomarkers for predicting tumor responses to mTOR inhibitors.  Rheb is a Ras family GTPase	 which binds to and activates mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) when GTP loaded. Recently	 cancer genome sequencing efforts have identified recurrent Rheb Tyr35Asn mutations in kidney and endometrial carcinoma. Here we show that Rheb-Y35N causes not only constitutive mTORC1 activation	 but sustained activation of the MEK-ERK pathway in a TSC1/TSC2/TBC1D7 protein complex and mTORC1-independent manner	 contributing to intrinsic resistance to rapamycin. Rheb-Y35N transforms NIH3T3 cells	 resulting in aggressive tumor formation in xenograft nude mice	 which could be suppressed by combined treatment with rapamycin and an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor. Furthermore	 Rheb-Y35N inhibits AMPKÎ± activation in response to nutrient depletion or 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR)	 leading to attenuated phosphorylation of BRAF-S729 and retained mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. Finally	 we demonstrate that Rheb-WT can bind AMPK to facilitate AMPK activation	 whereas Rheb-Y35N competitively binds AMPK	 impairing AMPK phosphorylation. In summary	 our findings indicate that Rheb-Y35N is a dominantly active tumor driver that activates both mTORC1 and MAPK to promote tumor growth	 suggesting a combination of mTORC1 and MAPK inhibitors may be of therapeutic value in patients whose cancers sustain this mutation.  Top of page Introduction Rheb	 is a 21-kDa GTPase member of the Ras superfamily	1	2	3	 4 which has a crucial role in the regulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)	 a serine/threonine kinase complex that drives diverse growth and anabolic processes.1	5	6	 7 mTORC1 integrates signals from both Rheb and the Rag GTPases	 to balance growth stimulatory signaling with nutrient availability.3	8	9	 10 The TSC1/TSC2/TBC1D7 protein complex (hereafter called the TSC protein complex) inhibits mTORC1 activity indirectly by reducing Rheb-GTP levels through the GAP activity of TSC2.6	11	 12 Previous reports have noted that Rheb overexpression can drive cell growth in some cell types and suggested that its expression at high levels may be important in skin carcinogenesis.13	14	 15  Recently	 cancer genome sequencing efforts have identified over 30 Rheb mutations in different human cancers (http://www.cbioportal.org/public-portal/). RhebTyr35 is an apparent hotspot for mutations	 with eight cancer samples showing mutation at this site	 of which five are Tyr35Asn (Rheb-Y35N) mutations	 identified in two uterine cancers	 two clear cell renal cell cancers and one papillary renal cell cancer.16 A recent study also demonstrated that Rheb-Y35N activated mTORC1 in a 293T cell transient overexpression assay.17 Here we explore the potential growth-promoting and signaling properties of Rheb-Y35N. We find that Rheb-Y35N activates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling	 in contrast to wild-type (WT) Rheb. Furthermore	 Y35N mutant causes anchorage-independent and clonogenic growth of NIH3T3 cells in low serum	 which is suppressed by combined mTORC1 and MAPK inhibition. In addition	 we demonstrate that both WT Rheb and Rheb-Y35N bind to AMPKÎ±	 whereas the mutant also inhibits AMPKÎ± phosphorylation and reduces pBRAF-S729 levels by competitive binding to AMPK	 probably contributing to MAPK activation. Our findings identify the effects of Rheb-Y35N on both MAPK and mTORC1	 and suggest that the use of combined mTOR and MAPK inhibition may be a useful therapeutic strategy for cancer patients with this mutation.  Top of page Results Rheb-Y35N mutant constitutively activates MAPK We established two stably transfected 293T cell lines with overexpression of WT Rheb and Rheb-Y35N mutant. Reverse transcriptaseâ€“PCR of Rheb mRNA followed by Sanger sequencing demonstrated that Rheb-Y35N mRNA comprise ~3/4 of total Rheb mRNA in Rheb-Y35N cells (Supplementary Figure 1). The level of Rheb expression in these cells was assessed by both immunoblotting and quantitative proteomic analysis	 showing that the expression of Rheb increased 3.14-fold compared with the empty vector-transfected cells (Supplementary Figures 2 and 3). Consistent with previous studies	11	 17 Y35N expression caused constitutive activation of mTORC1	 as assessed by pS6K-T389	 p4E-BP1-T70 and pS6	 but not mTORC2	 as assessed by pAKT-S473	 in the absence of serum (total Rheb as internal control; Supplementary Figure 2). Under standard growth conditions	 Rheb-Y35N cells demonstrated a modest increase in cell growth over that of control cells	 as well as Rheb-WT cells (Supplementary Figure 4). Treatment with rapamycin or Torin1 reduced cell growth for both WT and Y35N cells (Figure 1a). As expected	 pS6K and pS6 significantly decreased in response to both inhibitors in both Rheb-WT and -Y35N cells	 and Torin1 also reduced pAKT-S473 levels (Figure 1b). Interestingly	 the growth of Rheb-Y35N cells was significantly less sensitive to both inhibitors in comparison with Rheb-WT cells	 suggesting that Rheb-Y35N might drive cell growth through mechanisms other than mTOR. Higher levels of pERK1/2 were observed in the Rheb-Y35N cells in comparison with Rheb-WT cells	 along with increased pp90RSK	 which is the downstream target of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (Figures 1b and c). To confirm that Rheb-Y35N had specific effects in activating MAPK	 we expressed Rheb-WT at four fold higher levels than Rheb-Y35N in HEK 293T cells and observed that only Rheb-Y35N affected pERK levels (Supplementary Figure 5).

Full figure and legend (268K)  To assess the contribution of MAPK activation to the growth advantage of the Rheb-Y35N cells	 we examined the effects of treatment with SCH772984 (SCH)	 a specific ERK inhibitor18 (Figure 1d). We found that both rapamycin and SCH significantly inhibited growth of Rheb-Y35N 293T cells and the combination of drugs had a greater inhibitory effect than either alone (Figure 1d). Each drug inhibited its canonical target in both cell types (Figure 1e). Notably	 inhibition of ERK by SCH did not affect Y35N-induced pS6K activity (Figure 1e). In addition	 the growth inhibitory effect of SCH synergized with the growth inhibitory effects of rapamycin at 20â€‰nm over a broad range of SCH doses (Figure 1f) and the synergy persisted as the dose of each drug was increased	 demonstrated by the combination index value (Supplementary Table1). Transient co-transfection of TSC1	 TSC2 and PRK7-HA-S6K1 K100R(KR)	 a kinase inactive form of S6K19	 led to significant reduction in levels of pS6K1-T389 and pS6-S235/236	 in both Rheb-WT andY35N cells	 indicating Rheb-Y35N was still subject to TSC2 GAP activity in the presence of high levels of TSC1/2 (Figure 1g). In contrast	 overexpression of either or both TSC1 and TSC2 did not affect MAPK activation in the Y35N-expressing cells	 suggesting that MAPK activation by Rheb-Y35N was independent of GTP loading (Figure 1h). As ERK is also upstream of Rheb via TSC1/2	 we asked whether ERK activity can affect Y35N-induced mTOR activation in the absence of TSC1/2. We demonstrated that inhibition of ERK has no effect on S6K activation in Y35N-transfected TSC2âˆ’/âˆ’ MEF cells (Supplementary Figure 6B).  Rheb-Y35N is an oncogenic mutation To examine the effects of Y35N on mTORC1	 MAPK and growth signaling in greater detail	 we expressed both Rheb-WT and Rheb-Y35N in NIH3T3 cells. Immunoblot analysis confirmed that Rheb-Y35N had similar effects in NIH3T3 as seen in 293T cells	 including elevated levels of pMEK and pERK	 and activation of mTORC1	 as assessed by pS6K (Figure 2a). To examine growth effects	 we plated the cells at low density (1 Ã— 103cells/well and 1 Ã— 104 cells/well) and in low serum (0.5%). Rheb-Y35N cells grew robustly under these conditions	 in contrast to untransfected or Rheb-WT cells (Figure 2b). Furthermore	 treatment of Rheb-Y35N NIH3T3 cells with either 20â€‰nm rapamycinor 200â€‰nm SCH significantly reduced cell growth in these low-serum conditions. SCH had a greater inhibitory effect than rapamycin	 suggesting that activated ERK was more responsible for the enhanced cell survival displayed by Rheb-Y35N cells. Furthermore	 combined treatment with both rapamycin and SCH resulted in near-complete loss of viable Rheb-Y35N cells (Figure 2c). In addition	 Y35N NIH3T3 cells showed growth in soft agar similar to a transformed cancer line (J82	 bladder cancer)20 in contrast to empty vector or Rheb-WT-transfected NIH3T3 cells (Figure 2d). Furthermore	 rapamycin and SCH each inhibited colony formation of Rheb-Y35N NIH3T3 cells	 with a strong synergistic effect (Figure 2d). Immunoblot analysis confirmed the on-target effects of each inhibitor on mTORC1 and MAPK	 respectively (Figure 2e). Figure 2.

Full figure and legend (221K)  Rheb-Y35N blocks AMPKÎ± inhibition of BRAF to enhance MAPK activation We then explored the mechanism of Rheb-Y35N activation of the MAPK pathway. Previous reports have indicated that Rheb-WT activates AMPK in an mTORC1-independent manner21 and inhibits MAPK signaling.22 More recently	 activated AMPK has been shown to directly phosphorylate BRAF at S729	 a 14-3-3-binding site	 leading to reduced MEK-ERK signaling.23 Thus	 we hypothesized that Y35N mutant might have reduced or even inhibitory effects in activating AMPK	 compared with WT Rheb	 attenuating inhibitory effects of AMPK on MAPK activation. To explore this hypothesis	 we treated Rheb-WT and -Y35N HEK 293T cells with 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR)	 an AMPK activator. We found that AICAR induced levels of pAMPK-T172	 pBRAF-S729 and pACC-S79 in Rheb-WT cells	 and reduced pERK1/2 levels. In contrast	 AICAR had few effects in the Rheb-Y35N-expressing cells	 in which pERK1/2 remained elevated even with AICAR treatment (Figure 3a). Similar observations were made on Y35N NIH3T3 cells in response to AICAR (Supplementary Figure 7). Furthermore	 similar alterations of pAMPK	 pACC	 pBRAF and pERK levels were seen in cells on glucose starvation (Figure 3b). Figure 3.

Rheb-WT and Y35N cells were incubated in glucose-free Dulbeccoâ€™s modified Eagleâ€™s medium for 8â€‰h and then treated with/without 25â€‰mm d-glucose for 1â€‰h. Immunoblot analysis was performed using indicated antibodies. (c) HEK 293T cells were transfected with si-scramble and si-Rheb oligonucleotides. Forty-eight hours after transfection	 cells were treated with/without 0.5â€‰mm AICAR for 1â€‰h	 then lysed and subjected to immunoblotting. (d) Rheb-Y35N 293T cells were transfected with vector	 AMPK-WT and constitutively active form of AMPK (AMPK CA	 T174D)	 respectively. After 48-h incubation	 cells were treated with 0.5â€‰mm AICAR for 1â€‰h	 then lysed and subjected to immunoblotting. (e) Immunoblot analysis of Rheb-WT and -Y35N 293T cells with/without 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 30â€‰min. Total lysates were subjected to the indicated antibodies.  Full figure and legend (170K)  These results suggested that AMPK activity was inhibited by expression of Rheb-Y35N	 not Rheb-WT	 inhibiting stress response signaling to BRAF and ACC	 as well as suppression of ERK1/2 activity. To examine this hypothesis further	 we knocked down WT Rheb in 293T cells and found that loss of Rheb significantly reduced pAMPK-T172 and pBRAF-S729 levels in response to AICAR (Figure 3c). On the other hand	 transfection of a constitutively active form of AMPK (AMPK-Î±1-T174D)24 led to significantly increased pBRAF-S729 and decreased pERK in Y35N 293T cells (Figure 3d). Previous work has shown that ERK and p90Rsk phosphorylate LKB1	 which attenuates the ability of LKB1 to activate AMPK.25 To examine the possibility that LKB1 effects were influencing AMPK activity in Rheb-Y35N cells	 Rheb-WT/-Y35N 293T cells were serum starved. pLKB1-S428 levels were reduced in Rheb-Y35N 293T cells	 in comparison with Rheb-WT cells (Figure 3e)	 suggesting that reduction of pAMPK is not due to effects on LKB1.  Y35N mutant competitively binds AMPKÎ± to inhibit Rheb-WT-mediated AMPK activation Based on these findings	 we hypothesized that Rheb directly interacts with AMPK and affects its activity. To examine this	 the putative binding sites of Rheb to AMPK were predicted using zdock package	26 in which the structure of AMPK (PDBid:5ezv) was treated as the receptor and a total of 3600 conformations of Rheb (PDBid:4o25) were generated around the surface of AMPK.27 We demonstrated that Rheb may potentially bind the kinase domain of AMPKÎ± subunit (Supplementary Figure 8). In addition	 only a subtle difference in the volumetric maps between Rheb WT and Y35N mutant is observed (16.1â€‰nm3 vs 14.9â€‰nm3)	 suggesting that Y35N mutation may not affect the binding of Rheb to AMPKÎ±. To examine Rheb binding to AMPKa directly	 we used Flag-Rheb in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Both Rheb-WT and Rheb-Y35N bound to AMPKÎ± in the presence or absence of AICAR	 in contrast to Flag-KRAS	 and neither interacted with AMPKÎ²1 or LKB1 (Figure 4a). Similarly	 AMPK immunoprecipitation also pulled down Flag-tagged Rheb-WT and -Y35N	 confirming the interaction between these proteins (Figure 4b). Notably	 AMPK preferably binds Y35N	 supported by the increased binding of Y35N to AMPKÎ± compared with the WT (Figure 4b). Neither TSC2 nor mTOR was co-precipitated with AMPKÎ± under these conditions (Figure 4b). Finally	 we found that Rheb-Y35N had dominant activity over Rheb-WT in blocking pAMPK and pBRAF levels	 and stimulating MAPK signaling	 when expressed at an equimolar ratio (Rheb-WT and Rheb-WT+Y35N ratio: 1:1) (Figure 4c) and similar effect was observed when Rheb WT and Rheb-WT+Y35N ratio was 1:2 (Supplementary Figure 9).

Full figure and legend (161K)  Taken together	 our results suggest that Rheb-Y35N binds to AMPK in competition with Rheb-WT	 to constitutively inhibit AMPK activity regardless of AICAR treatment or nutrient depletion	 leading to attenuated phosphorylation at BRAF-S729 and enhanced MAPK signaling.  Combined mTOR and ERK inhibition effectively reduces tumor growth of Rheb-Y35N xenografts As shown above	 Rheb-Y35N expression activates both mTOR and MAPK pathways	 leading us to hypothesize that this mutant is a driver oncogenic event contributing to cancer development through activation of both growth pathways. To examine this hypothesis	 NIH3T3 cells expressing Rheb-WT	 Rheb-Y35N and KRas-G12D were implanted into immunodeficient nude mice for xenograft tumor formation. Solid tumors were readily visible on mice injected with all three NIH3T3 cell lines. Notably	 Rheb-Y35N expressing NIH3T3 cells formed tumors most quickly and the tumors were significantly larger than either of the other cells injected	 at 3 weeks after implantation (Figure 5a). To determine whether Rheb-Y35N NIH3T3 xenograft tumors were dependent on mTORC1 and MAPK signaling	 mice were treated with vehicle	 rapamycin	 SCH or a combination of both drugs every 3 days for 3 weeks after tumor volume reached a threshold size (300â€‰mm3). Although each of rapamycin and SCH alone caused a significant decrease in tumor growth	 combination treatment resulted in a significantly greater reduction than either agent alone	 effectively arresting tumor growth during the 3 weeks therapy (Figures 5b and c). To test the specificity of drug treatment of Rheb-Y35N cell line	 we adopted the identical protocol to test drug treatment effect for Rheb-WT cell. No significant synergistic effect of the combination treatment was observed for Rheb-WT-implanted groups (Supplementary Figure 10). Figure 5.

Left 4 Ã— 4 panel	 Rheb-Y35N xenograft tumors from mice treated with vehicle	 rapamycin	 SCH77294 or the combination	 respectively	 were assessed using pS6(235/236) and pERK1/2 antibodies. Upper right	 KRas-G12D and Rheb-WT xenograft tumor were stained with pERK1/2 antibody without any drug treatment. Lower right	 Rheb-WT and-Y35N xenograft tumor were stained with pBRAF-S729 antibody without any drug treatment. Scale bar	 50â€‰Î¼m; 1 and 2 are the mice that were randomly selected from each group.  Full figure and legend (458K)  None of the treated mice showed any evidence of toxicity or body weight loss (Supplementary Figure 11). In addition	 we analyzed pERK1/2 and pS6 in tumors from in vivo xenograft mice (two out of four each group). As expected	 KRas-G12D and Rheb-Y35N untreated xenograft mice showed significant upregulated level of pERK1/2	 whereas no ERK activation was observed in Rheb-WT mice (Figure 5d). In contrast to pERK1/2	 levels of pBRAF-S729 was downregulated in Rheb-Y35N xenograft mice compared with Rheb-WT (Figure 5d). Furthermore	 the levels of pS6 and pERK1/2 were significantly decreased in Rheb-Y35N xenograft mice treated with rapamycin	 SCH772984 and combination treatment (Figure 5d). Collectively	 these results are consistent with our observation that Rheb-Y35N leads to constitutive activation of MAPK	 and inhibition of both mTORC1 and MAPK activity is necessary for suppressing Rheb-Y35N tumor growth in vivo.  Top of page Discussion Rheb regulates multiple cellular processes including cell growth	 protein translation	 differentiation	 anabolic processes and autophagy	 largely through its effects on mTORC1.28	29	30	 31 Rheb-GTP levels are directly regulated by TSC2	 which occurs in the TSC protein complex with TSC1 and TBC1D7	 and functions as a GAP for Rheb.32 Rheb-GTP is the active form of Rheb	 which mediates mTORC1 activation.6 It has been shown that some artificially generated Rheb mutants	 such as S16N/H	 Q64L	 S89D/N and N153T/S	 have increased GTP loading	 are resistant to TSC2 GAP activity and lead to sustained mTORC1 activation.10	33	 34 Moreover	 Q64L and N153T mutants can induce in vitro oncogenic transformation via constitutive mTOR activation.35 Importantly	 introduction of Rheb Q64L mutant into hematopoietic progenitor cells could initiate in vivo lymphomagenesis	 which was characterized with mature B-cell phenotype and sensitive to mTOR inhibition	 suggesting that gain-of-function mutation of Rheb is sufficient to develop cancer with short latency.36  However	 patient-derived Rheb mutations have not been reported until recently. Cancer genome studies have identified Rheb mutations in many types of human cancer	 suggesting the possible function of these mutations as drivers of cancer development. However	 most of these mutations have been seen only once or twice	 suggesting that they may represent background or genetic noise rather than tumor activating events. Here we focused on Rheb-Y35N	 the only recurrent Rheb mutation.16 Previous studies showed that Rheb-Y35N could activate mTORC1	 similar to activating mutations in mTOR.11	 17 In addition	 Rheb-Y35A mutant has also been reported to increase the intrinsic nucleotide hydrolysis through enhancing the access of Asp65	 which acts as a catalytic residue to promote GTP hydrolysis.37 Tyr35 normally inhibits this interaction	 helping to explain the low intrinsic GTPase activity of Rheb. A recent study reported that Y35N mutant is resistant to TSC2 GAP activity or GTP hydrolysis	11 whereas our results showed that Y35N mutant was still subject to regulation by the TSC complex	 in that overexpression of TSC1/2 resulted in significant reduction of pS6K and pS6 in Rheb-Y35N-expressing cells (Figure 1g). Further study to characterize the precise mechanism by which the Y35N mutation can activate mTORC1 is needed.  The finding that MAPK is constitutively activated by Rheb-Y35N	 independent of mTORC1 and TSC protein complex activity	 was unexpected. In contrast to the effect of Rheb-Y35N on mTORC1 activation	 MAPK activation is independent of both serum stimulation and mTORC1 activity. Furthermore	 MAPK activation is seen only in the Y35N and not in WT Rheb-expressing cells. In addition	 Y35N-induced MAPK activation in combination with mTORC1 activation led to robust growth in low-serum conditions at low density	 as well as anchorage-independent cell growth in soft agar. Hence	 we have demonstrated that Rheb-Y35N acts as a dominant driver oncogene. Furthermore	 our in vivo xenograft data indicate that concurrent activation of both MAPK and mTORC1 by Rheb-Y35N is crucial for its tumorigenic properties. Indeed	 NIH3T3 cells transfected with Rheb-Y35N developed xenograft tumors and grew more rapidly than KRas-G12D	 the prototype classic oncogene. We also examined the co-mutations occurring with Rheb-Y35N using the cBio database (http://www.cbioportal.org/). Mutations in some oncogenes and tumor suppressors co-occurred with Rheb-Y35N in uterine cancer	 including KRas-G12V	 and inactivating mutations of phosphatase and tensin homolog and ARID1A. In contrast	 Rheb-Y35N mutations in renal cell carcinoma were solitary	 or occurred simultaneously with VHL mutation. These observations also suggest that Rheb-Y35N is capable of stimulating cell growth independently. Last	 our in vivo combination treatments combining mTORC1 and MAPK inhibitors were very effective in preventing Rheb-Y35N NIH3T3 cell growth as xenografts	 suggesting the therapeutic potential of this combination strategy for cancer patients carrying Rheb-Y35N mutation.  It has been shown that WT Rheb activates AMPK in an mTOR-independent manner21 and AMPK inhibits MAPK activation through directly phosphorylating BRAF at S729.23 These findings led us to examine the interaction between Rheb-Y35N and AMPKÎ±. We showed that Rheb-Y35N impaired AMPKÎ± activation in response to AICAR or nutrient depletion	 leading to reduced levels of pBRAF-S729 and persistent activation of the MEK-ERK pathway. We also examined the possibility that increased levels of pERK might attenuate AMPK activation through phosphorylation of LKB1 at S428	 an inhibitory site of AMPK phosphorylation	25 but observed decreased levels of pLKB1-S428 in Rheb-Y35N transfected cells compared with WT. In addition	 our analyses showed that Rheb could directly bind to AMPKÎ±	 to regulate its activity. This binding appears enhanced by Rheb-Y35N expression	 suggesting that this aberrant binding may lead to inactivation of AMPK activity on its usual substrates	 explaining the ERK1/2 activation (Figure 6). Indeed	 we showed that Rheb-Y35N had dominant effects over co-expression of Rheb-WT. Collectively	 these results suggest that WT Rheb is essential for normal AMPKÎ± activation	 and that Rheb-Y35N strongly inhibits the ability of AMPK to be activated in response to energy stress or nutrient depletion.

Left	 when AMPK binds WT Rheb and is activated by AICAR or glucose starvation	 BRAF is phosphorylated	 14-3-3 protein binds pBRAF-S729 and there is inhibition of ERK activation. Right	 the Rheb-Y35N mutant outcompetes WT Rheb for binding to the AMPK	 leading to AMPK inhibition independent of nutrient depletion	 reduced phosphorylation of pBRAF-S729 and activation of ERK by phosphorylation by BRAF.  Full figure and legend (113K)  In summary	 our results demonstrate that Rheb-Y35N activates both mTORC1 and MAPK pathways. Furthermore	 Rheb-Y35N constitutively activates MAPK pathway by regulating AMPKÎ± and leading to phosphorylation of BRAF	 promoting cell survival and transforming of NIH3T3 cells. Finally	 inhibition of both mTOR and MAPK signals is necessary to suppress Y35N-driven in vivo tumor growth. These findings suggest that cancers with Rheb-Y35N mutations may be uniquely sensitive to combination treatment with rapamycin and an ERK inhibitor.   Rheb	 an activator of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)	 displays low intrinsic GTPase activity favoring the biologically activated	 GTP-bound state. We identified a Rheb mutation (Y35A) that increases its intrinsic nucleotide hydrolysis activity âˆ¼10-fold	 and solved structures of both its active and inactive forms	 revealing an unexpected mechanism of GTP hydrolysis involving Asp65 in switch II and Thr38 in switch I. In the wild-type protein this noncanonical mechanism is markedly inhibited by Tyr35	 which constrains the active site conformation	 restricting the access of the catalytic Asp65 to the nucleotide-binding pocket. Rheb Y35A mimics the enthalpic and entropic changes associated with GTP hydrolysis elicited by the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) TSC2	 and is insensitive to further TSC2 stimulation. Overexpression of Rheb Y35A impaired the regulation of mTORC1 signaling by growth factor availability. We demonstrate that the opposing functions of Tyr35 in the intrinsic and GAP-stimulated GTP catalysis are critical for optimal mTORC1 regulation. ________________________________________ Graphical Abstract   Figure options Highlights â–º Tyr35 autoinhibits intrinsic GTPase activity of Rheb and maintains activation â–º Rheb Y35A efficiently hydrolyzes GTP using Asp65 rather than Gln64 â–º Tyr35 and Asp65 are indispensable for sensitivity of Rheb to TSC2GAP function â–º Regulation of mTORC1 by growth factors depends on Rheb Tyr35 and Asp65 ________________________________________ Introduction Small GTPases act as molecular switches to regulate diverse cellular functions. When bound to guanosine triphosphate (GTP)	 they adopt an â€œonâ€ conformation that elicits a biological response. GTP hydrolysis is accompanied by a conformational change into a GDP-bound â€œoffâ€ conformation. Cycling between the active and inactive states of each GTPase is a result of the intrinsic nucleotide hydrolysis and exchange rates	 and regulatory proteins that catalyze these processes. GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) stimulate GTP hydrolysis	 whereas guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) mediate the displacement of GDP	 allowing a new GTP molecule to bind (Bos et al.	 2007). GTPase proteins possess either complete or partial catalytic machinery for hydrolysis of GTP. In most cases an electronegative group is used for stabilization/polarization of the hydrolytic water for in-line nucleophilic attack of the Î³-phosphate (Li and Zhang	 2004; Maegley et al.	 1996). In most Ras and Rho subfamily GTPases	 this is achieved by the carboxamide oxygen of a conserved Gln in a dynamic loop called switch II. Ras and Rho GAPs work by stabilizing this Gln in a catalytic conformation	 whereas an Arg residue referred to as an â€œArginine fingerâ€ neutralizes the developing negative charge on the Î±- and Î²-phosphates of GTP (Scheffzek et al.	 1997). In other systems	 such as Rap-RapGAP	 a catalytic asparagine is provided in trans by the GAP ( Scrima et al.	 2008). Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb) is a key regulator of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway (Dunlop et al.	 2009; Inoki et al.	 2003). Rheb-GTP promotes phosphorylation of mTORC1 targets	 resulting in enhanced protein translation and cellular growth (Garami et al.	 2003). Rheb has an unusually slow intrinsic GTPase activity	 which is regulated by the GAP activity of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2)	 a tumor suppressor frequently inactivated in human patients with the tumor predisposition syndrome tuberous sclerosis (Garami et al.	 2003; Tee et al.	 2003). Rheb overexpression has been observed in certain cancer cell lines (Eom et al.	 2008; Im et al.	 2002; Nardella et al.	 2008)	 and constitutively activated Rheb mutants can induce oncogenic transformation in cell culture (Jiang and Vogt	 2008). The low intrinsic GTPase activity of Rheb has been attributed to the catalytically incompetent conformation of Gln64 (Yu et al.	 2005)	 which is homologous to Ras Gln61	 but does not participate in GTP hydrolysis (Li et al.	 2004; Marshall et al.	 2009). TSC2GAP is thought to utilize Asn1643 to promote GTP hydrolysis by substituting for Gln64 in an â€œAsn thumbâ€-type mechanism (Inoki et al.	 2003; Marshall et al.	 2009) similar to that of RapGAP (Scrima et al.	 2008). Here	 utilizing site-directed mutagenesis	 crystallography	 and real-time NMR-based GTPase assays	 we discovered that Rheb Tyr35	 a residue that is highly conserved across the small GTPase superfamily (Wennerberg et al.	 2005)	 maintains the high activation state of Rheb by inhibiting intrinsic GTP hydrolysis. Mutation of this residue substantially accelerated intrinsic nucleotide hydrolysis through a catalytic mechanism that did not require Gln64 but also conferred resistance to the activity of TSC2. Crystal structures of Rheb Y35A led us to identify the backbone carbonyl of Thr38 and side chain of Asp65 as candidate residues that contribute to the intrinsic GTPase activity. Mutagenesis studies confirm that Asp65 contributes significantly to the intrinsic GTPase activity of both wild-type (WT) Rheb and the Y35A mutant. Furthermore	 Asp65 was absolutely essential for the sensitivity of Rheb to the GAP activity of TSC2	 whereas Gln64 was dispensable. Consistent with the in vitro data	 expression of Rheb Y35A and D65A mutants in mammalian cells affected transduction of growth factor signals to mTORC1. Taken together	 our observations reveal an efficient noncanonical mechanism of GTP hydrolysis by Rheb and suggest that autoinhibition of catalysis maintains Rheb in its highly activated state upon growth factor stimulation	 which is necessary for the proper signal transduction to mTORC1. Results Rheb Y35 Inhibits Intrinsic GTPase Activity We previously showed that fluorescent-tagged nucleotides can alter the hydrolysis and exchange rates governing the GTPase cycle (Mazhab-Jafari et al.	 2010). The most striking example we observed was that 2â€²-/3â€²-O-(Nâ€²-Methylanthraniloyl) (mant)GTP was hydrolyzed by Rheb âˆ¼10-fold faster than GTP. This is not an intrinsic property of the modified nucleotide because the mant moiety inhibited GTP hydrolysis by RhoA and did not affect hydrolysis by Ras. The rate of mantGTP hydrolysis by Rheb is similar to that of Ras (Figure 1A)	 indicating that Rheb has a latent capacity for efficient catalysis. Interestingly	 however	 the rapid hydrolysis of mantGTP was independent of Rheb Gln64 (Mazhab-Jafari et al.	 2010). The position of the fluorophore in a structure of Ras bound to a nonhydrolyzable analog of mantGTP (Scheidig et al.	 1995) suggested that it may interact with the phenol ring of Tyr35 in switch I of Rheb. Remarkably	 mutation of Tyr35 to Ala recapitulated the mant effect	 increasing the rate of GTP hydrolysis by an order of magnitude (Figure 1B). Furthermore	 the mant tag had no further effect on the catalytic activity of Rheb Y35A	 suggesting that the mutation and the fluorophore stimulate hydrolysis through the same mechanism (Figure 1B). These observations indicate that Tyr35 autoinhibits the intrinsic GTPase activity of Rheb.   Figure 1.  Rapid Hydrolysis of mantGTP by Rheb Is Related to Autoinhibitory Role of Tyr35 (A) Hydrolysis of GTP or mantGTP by Rheb (black and green	 respectively) and Ras (red and blue	 respectively) is shown.

Figure options Structural Basis for the Tyr35 Autoinhibitory Function We crystallized GDP-bound Rheb Y35A in the presence of excess GMPPNP (a nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP)	 and to our surprise	 the asymmetric unit contained two molecules of Rheb: one bound to GDP and one to GMPPNP (Figures 2Aâ€“2C; Table 1). The overall protein fold is very similar to WT Rheb (Yu et al.	 2005) (backbone rmsd of 0.44 Ã…) with a few key differences. The nucleotide-binding pocket is completely solvent exposed in the GMPPNP-bound structure of Rheb Y35A	 whereas in the WT protein the triphosphate group of the nucleotide is shielded from the solvent by the phenol ring of Tyr35	 which forms a hydrogen bond with the Î³-phosphate. In addition the Î³-phosphate is 0.5 Ã… closer to Thr38 in the absence of Tyr35 (Figure 2D)	 which in the WT structure â€œpullsâ€ the Î³-phosphate toward the middle of switch I. Interestingly	 the hydrolytic water is closer to the backbone carbonyl of Thr38 in the mutant (2.7 versus 3.8 Ã… in the WT protein) (Figure 2D)	 placing it in a more electron-rich environment that may enhance its polarization for an in-line nucleophilic attack to the Î³-phosphate. It has been proposed that the corresponding backbone carbonyl of Ras (Thr35) contributes to the stabilization/activation of the catalytic water during intrinsic GTP hydrolysis (Buhrman et al.	 2010; Frech et al.	 1994). Comparison of our structure with that of WT Rheb indicates that Tyr35 pulls the Î³-phosphate and catalytic water away from the Thr38 carbonyl	 thus reducing its catalytic contribution.   Figure 2.  Structure and Dynamics of Rheb Y35A (A) Asymmetric unit and electron density of nucleotide substrates are demonstrated. The asymmetric unit of the Rheb Y35A crystal containing one GDP-bound (cyan) and one GMPPNP-bound (green) Rheb molecule is shown in the center. 2Fo-Fc electron density maps at 1.5Ïƒ of the nucleotide-binding site with GMPPNP (left) fitted into one Rheb Y35A molecule and GDP (right) in the second molecule of the crystal asymmetric unit is illustrated.

Table options Switch I of Rheb Y35A does not undergo any substantial conformational change upon nucleotide hydrolysis"	 whereas this region of the WT protein exhibits a large structural change mediated by an interaction between Tyr35 and the Î³-phosphate (Yu et al.	 2005) (Figures 2E and 2F). It was hypothesized that a similar nucleotide-dependent rearrangement of Rap Tyr32 would be energetically unfavorable to the GTPase reaction (Cherfils et al.	 1997)	 consistent with our observation that nucleotide hydrolysis is accelerated by a mutation that disrupts this conformational change. Identification of a Catalytic Residue for GTP Hydrolysis Previous work has shown that Gln64	 corresponding to the catalytic Gln61 of Ras	 is not involved in GTP hydrolysis by WT Rheb (Inoki et al.	 2003; Li et al.	 2004; Marshall et al.	 2009). Likewise	 Gln64 remains in a noncatalytic conformation in the structure of Rheb Y35A (see Figure S1A available online) and is not required for the accelerated hydrolysis of GTP by Rheb Y35A (Figures S1D and S2A). Because the catalytic residues of other small GTPase superfamily members are found in the N terminus of switch II	 we examined this region for residues with electronegative side chains that may contribute to the hydrolytic reaction. Immediately downstream of Gln64 are two residues with acidic side chains: Asp65 and Glu66 (Figure 2G). The crystal structure of Rheb Y35A shows that the backbone of the N-terminal loop of switch II of this mutant is displaced by an average of 1 Ã… toward the nucleotide-binding pocket relative to the WT	 which brings the side-chain carboxylate of Asp65 closer to the nucleotide by 1 Ã…: average Asp65OÎ´1	2WT âˆ’ average Asp65OÎ´1	2Y35A (Figure 2G). Mutation of Asp65 to Ala reduced the intrinsic hydrolysis of Rheb Y35A by more than 60% and that of WT by 30% (Figure 3A)	 as did the conservative substitution of Asp65 by Asn (Figure S2B). On the other hand	 mutations of Glu66 had no effect on intrinsic GTPase activity (Figure S2C)	 consistent with its perpendicular orientation away from the nucleotide (Figure 2G). We also tested all other residues found within 10 Ã… of the hydrolytic water in the Rheb Y35A structure that could potentially provide (1) a negative charge to activate this water molecule	 or (2) a positive charge to stabilize the Î²- and Î³-phosphates in the transition state for hydrolysis (Figure S1). There was no change in the rate of intrinsic nucleotide hydrolysis associated with R15G	 S16A	 or D36A mutations (Figures S1B	 S1C	 and S1E). The only other charged residues within 10 Ã… of the hydrolytic water are Lys19 and Asp60 of the highly conserved G1 and G3 box motifs	 respectively. The Rheb K19A mutant failed to express	 presumably due to impaired nucleotide binding	 and D60A was highly unstable and could not be loaded with GTP	 consistent with the role of this residue in Mg2+ coordination (Yu et al.	 2005). These data strongly suggest that Asp65 is the sole candidate for a catalytic residue in Rheb. Notably	 carboxylates are more potent nucleophiles than carboxamides	 and consistently	 the Q61E substitution increased the GTPase activity of Ras (Frech et al.	 1994).   Figure 3.  Role of Asp65 in Intrinsic and GAP-Mediated GTP Hydrolysis by Rheb (A) Hydrolysis of GTP by WT Rheb (black)	 the mutants D65A and Y35A (blue and green	 respectively)	 as well as the double-mutant Y35A-D65A (red) is illustrated. Reaction rates derived by curve fitting are presented in the insets. (B) Sensitivity of WT Rheb and Asp65 mutants to TSC2GAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis is shown. WT	 WT+GAP	 D65A+GAP	 D65E+GAP	 and D65N+GAP are shown with black	 blue	 green	 yellow	 and red	 respectively. Error bars associated with data points in the curves represent SD of the fraction GDP reported by several residues. Error bars in the histograms represent the uncertainty associated with rates derived from curve fitting. See also Figures S1	 S2	 and S5. Figure options In the structure of WT Rheb	 the carboxylate of Asp65 is 12 Ã… (average Asp65OÎ´1	2) from the Î³-phosphate in a single conformation	 whereas the electron density of Rheb Y35A indicates that Asp65 exists in two conformations	 11.0 and 12.0 Ã… from the Î³-phosphate	 respectively (Figure S1F). By comparison the catalytic carboxamide of Ras (Gln61OÎµ) has been found at distances varying from 4.7 to 12.2 Ã… from the Î³-phosphate (median distance of 8.1Ã…) (Figure S3A) in available crystallographic snapshots	 consistent with the dynamic nature of switch II determined by NMR studies (Ito et al.	 1997). Thus	 despite its established role as a catalytic residue (Frech et al.	 1994)	 Gln61 is rarely found in a catalytically competent conformation in Ras crystal structures	 presumably because this state is transient and energetically unfavorable (Fraser et al.	 2011; Grant et al.	 2009). Similarly	 our Y35A structure and the previous WT Rheb structure (Yu et al.	 2005) both appear to be energetically stable states	 with the conformations of Asp65 stabilized primarily by ionic and polar interactions with the Arg15 and Ser68 side chains	 which are also found in two alternate conformations in our structure (Figure S1F). Interestingly	 comparison of WT and Y35A 1H-15N heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra revealed increased line broadening for residues in the P loop and the N terminus of switch II of GTP-bound Rheb Y35A (Figures 2H and S4A)	 suggesting elevated dynamics in Î¼s-ms timescale. This could allow the N terminus of switch II to sample alternate conformations closer to the nucleotide and the catalytic water. The elevated dynamics of the N-terminal region of switch II and its proximity to the nucleotide-binding site in Rheb Y35A is consistent with the greater impact on catalysis of Asp65 mutations in the Y35A mutant than in WT Rheb (Figure 3A). Hence	 in addition to affecting the orientation of the nucleotide and hydrolytic water	 Tyr35 may reduce the intrinsic GTPase activity of Rheb by restricting the dynamics of switch II and displacing it from the nucleotide-binding site. Relative to Ras	 the catalytic Gln residues of Rho subfamily GTPases were found closer to the Î³-phosphate (median distance of 5.5Ã…) (Figures S3A and S3C)	 which may contribute to their faster intrinsic nucleotide hydrolysis rate (Mazhab-Jafari et al.	 2010). On the other hand	 Gln63	 which was recently proposed to be a noncanonical catalytic residue of Rap in GAP1IP4BP-mediated GTP hydrolysis (Sot et al.	 2010)	 is found with a median distance of 11.8 Ã… from the Î³-phosphate in structures of free Rap (Figure S3A)	 consistent with the slow nucleotide hydrolysis of this GTPase. In Ras	 Gly12	 Gly13	 and Gln61 are the major sites of oncogenic mutations. Mutation of Ras Gly12 to any other residue hinders GTP hydrolysis by sterically occluding access of the catalytic residue Gln61 to the hydrolytic water and nucleotide (Krengel et al.	 1990). However	 Rheb has an Arg in this position	 and its mutation to Gly (R15G) does not increase the catalytic activity of Rheb Y35A (Figure S1E) or WT (Im et al.	 2002; Li et al.	 2004; Marshall et al.	 2009; Yamagata et al.	 1994). The distinctive impact of P loop residues on the activities of Ras and Rheb lends further support to the different molecular mechanisms of action of these two closely related GTPase homologs. Involvement of Rheb's Asp65 and Tyr35 in TSC2GAP-Mediated GTP Hydrolysis Mutation of the solvent-exposed residue Asp65 to Ala (D65A) did not perturb the structure of Rheb	 on the basis of minimal and localized chemical shift perturbations in the 1H-15N HSQC spectra that were mainly confined to switch II (Figure S5)	 but totally abolished the susceptibility of Rheb to the GAP activity of TSC2 (Figure 3B). Furthermore	 even conservative mutations of Asp65 (D65E/N) rendered Rheb totally insensitive to the activity of TSC2GAP. The strict requirement for the geometry and charge of this side chain suggest that it might be a critical catalytic residue for the GAP-mediated hydrolysis reaction. We also tested the sensitivity of the GTPase activity of Rheb Y35A to the action of TSC2GAP and found that the GTPase activity of this mutant was not further stimulated by the addition of the GAP domain of TSC2 (Figure 4A). An analogous mutation (Y32A) impaired the sensitivity of Rap GTPase to the function of RapGAP (Brinkmann et al.	 2002; Scrima et al.	 2008); however	 a conservative mutation (Y32F) was tolerated. Interestingly	 the Y35F mutation was sufficient to render Rheb insensitive to the function of the TSC2GAP (Figure 4B)	 highlighting differences in the details of molecular recognition in these two homologous systems.   Figure 4.  Tyr35 Hydroxyl Is Required for TSC2GAP-Assisted GTP Hydrolysis (A) Intrinsic and GAP-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis by Rheb Y35A is presented. (B) Intrinsic and GAP-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis by Rheb Y35F is demonstrated. In both graphs the GTPase activities of mutant Rheb with and without TSC2GAP are shown in black and green	 respectively	 and the TSC2GAP-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis by WT Rheb is shown in blue. Error bars associated with data points in the curves represent SD of the fraction GDP reported by several residues. Error bars in the histograms represent the uncertainty associated with rates derived from curve fitting. See also Figure S4. Figure options Thermodynamic Basis for the Tyr35 Autoinhibitory Function To better understand the energetic basis of Tyr35 autoinhibition	 we analyzed the thermodynamics of the GTP hydrolysis reaction using an Arrhenius plot (Figure S6). This powerful technique allows one to extract energetic parameters	 such as enthalpy	 entropy	 and free energy	 from the highly unstable and low-populated transition state of an enzymatic reaction. The increased catalytic activity of Rheb Y35A was associated with a large reduction in the activation enthalpy for GTP hydrolysis (Figure S6; Table 2). However	 the activation entropy was also reduced (unfavorable contribution)	 resulting in a modest decrease in the overall activation free energy of the nucleotide hydrolysis reaction in the mutant. Because there is a buildup of negative charge on the Î²-Î³-bridging oxygen during GTP hydrolysis (Allin et al.	 2001; Cepus et al.	 1998; Du et al.	 2000)	 the proximity of the electron-rich phenol ring of Rheb Tyr35 could destabilize the transition state	 which is consistent with the reduction in activation enthalpy associated with mutation of this residue. Interestingly	 the Arg fingers of Ras- and Rho-GAPs accelerate nucleotide hydrolysis of their cognate GTPases by providing positive charge in a position equivalent to that of Rheb Tyr35. Another contribution to the enthalpic term may come from the strengthened hydrogen bond between the Thr38 carbonyl in the mutant and the repositioned catalytic water	 which may be more reactive toward the Î³-phosphate (Frech et al.	" 1994). Table 2.

T is set to 298 K in the equation Î”Gâ€¡ = Î”Hâ€¡ âˆ’ T Î”Sâ€¡. See also Figure S6. a Values from Marshall et al. (2009). Table options The larger negative value of Î”Sâ€¡ for Rheb Y35A indicates that formation of the transition state requires the mutant to undergo a larger increase in â€œorderâ€ than the WT protein. In the crystal structure of WT Rheb-GMPPNP	 a hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl of Tyr35 and the Î³-phosphate of GMPPNP stabilizes switch I	 contributing to the order of the ground state. Disruption of this contact by mutation of Tyr35 increases the disorder in switch I	 as illustrated by partial spectral broadening of peaks from residues 27â€“30 of GTP-bound Rheb Y35A (Figure S4). Thus	 assembly of the ordered transition state from the more flexible Rheb Y35A ground state would be more entropically unfavorable. The conservative mutation Y35F increased intrinsic hydrolysis almost as much as Y35A with similar thermodynamic effects (Figure S6; Table 2)	 suggesting that the H bond between the hydroxyl of Tyr35 and the Î³-phosphate is critical for the autoinhibition of Rheb's GTPase activity. It is very interesting to note that the thermodynamic landscape of intrinsic GTP hydrolysis in the Y35A mutant (reduced activation enthalpy with an entropic penalty) is similar to that reported for TSC2GAP-mediated GTP hydrolysis in WT Rheb (Marshall et al.	 2009)	 suggesting that TSC2GAP may promote hydrolysis in part by disrupting the electrostatic contact between Tyr35 and the Î³-phosphate. Consistent with this hypothesis	 the increased rate of GTP hydrolysis by the Rheb Y35A/Y35F mutants is not further accelerated by the addition of the GAP (Figure 4). The larger reduction of the activation enthalpy by TSC2GAP-mediated catalysis compared to Y35A mutation suggests that the GAP provides additional stimulatory electrostatic contributions to GTP hydrolysis	 perhaps via complementation of the intrinsic catalytic machinery by the Asn thumb. On the other hand the larger unfavorable reduction in entropy of the GAP-mediated reaction could be due to complex formation between Rheb and the GAP domain of TSC2. Mutation of Asp65 substantially impairs the stimulatory effect of the Y35A mutation on intrinsic hydrolysis; hence	 we measured the thermodynamic parameters of the transition state for the Rheb double-mutant Y35A-D65A (Table 2). Mutation of Asp65 increased the activation enthalpy (Î”Hâ€¡) of Rheb Y35A	 indicating that the negatively charged carboxylic acid side chain of Asp65 stabilizes the transition state because the enthalpic term originates primarily from electrostatic interactions (KÃ¶tting and Gerwert	 2004). In Ras the enthalpic contribution to hydrolysis was attributed to the charge shift from the Î³- toward the Î²-phosphate (KÃ¶tting and Gerwert	 2004). We propose that electrostatic interactions between Rheb Asp65 and the nucleotide similarly shift charge in the transition state to promote hydrolysis. Interestingly	 Tyr35 reduces the enthalpic contribution of Asp65 to GTP hydrolysis	 Î”Î”Hâ€¡(Y35A-Y35A	D65A) > Î”Î”Hâ€¡(WT-D65A) (Table 2)	 which is consistent with our kinetic data (Figure 3A). Regulation of mTORC1 by Growth Factors Involves the Noncanonical Catalytic and Autoinhibitory Mechanisms To investigate the role of Rheb's catalytic machinery	 and its autoinhibition	 in the activation of mTORC1	 HeLa cells were transfected with WT Rheb or the Y35A or D65A mutants. Phosphorylation of p70 S6K Thr389	 a measure of mTORC1 signaling throughput (Figure 5A)	 was monitored by immunoblotting	 upon growth factor starvation	 as well as 15 min and 6 hr after growth factor stimulation (Figures 5B and S7). Following growth factor stimulation	 when the TSC1/TSC2 complex is downregulated (Benvenuto et al.	 2000; Chong-Kopera et al.	 2006)	 mutation of Rheb Tyr35 to Ala reduced the activation of mTORC1	 as evidenced by slightly lower p70 S6K phosphorylation despite higher Rheb Y35A expression compared to Rheb WT	 an effect made more apparent with longer stimulation (Figures 5B and S7). Remarkably	 in the absence of stimuli upon serum starvation	 Rheb Y35A led to a significant increase in mTORC1 activity	 as did the expression of the GAP-resistant mutant Rheb D65A (Figure 5B). Mutation of Asp65 (but not Tyr35) perturbed the chemical shift of the neighboring switch II residue Tyr67 (Figures S4A and S5)	 previously shown to be critical for activation of mTORC1 (Long et al.	 2007)	 which may affect the ability of Rheb D65A to fully activate mTORC1. This may explain the fact that under conditions of growth factor stimulation	 Rheb D65A induced less S6K phosphorylation than the WT protein	 despite its reduced intrinsic GTPase activity (Figure 5B).   Figure 5.

The background intensity was used as estimation for the error in the intensity measurements and propagated appropriately throughout division. More details are described in Experimental Procedures. Representative western blots are shown in Figure S7. (C) Rheb nucleotide loading monitored in HEK293 cells with 32P-labeling experiment as described in Experimental Procedures is presented. See also Figure S7. Figure options Guanine nucleotide loading of WT Rheb and the mutants in vivo was determined by their immunoprecipitation from HEK293 cells metabolically labeled with 32P-orthophosphate and nucleotide resolution by thin-layer chromatography (Figure 5C). Consistent with its increased GTPase activity	 Rheb Y35A displayed reduced loading of GTP	 whereas Rheb D65A showed modestly increased GTP loading. Reflected in the elevated loading of WT Rheb with GTP (Figure 5C)	 the overabundance of transfected Rheb proteins likely negates the effects of endogenous TSC2 on the overexpressed Rheb mutants in this cell line. Although the lower GTP loading of Rheb Y35A indicates higher intrinsic hydrolysis rate than that of the WT protein	 modestly increased GTP loading of D65A signifies the autoinhibitory effects of Tyr35 on Asp65's contribution to intrinsic catalysis	 consistent with their in vitro behavior (Figure 3A). Discussion GTPases are versatile molecular switches that utilize surprisingly diverse mechanisms to mediate the interconversion between the active and inactive states. The study presented here illustrates how Rheb evolved a GTP hydrolysis mechanism drastically different from its close homolog H-Ras. Rheb employs an autoinhibitory mechanism to maintain a high activation state in cells essential for the proper maintenance of mTORC1 signaling and cellular growth. The autoinhibitory mechanism functions via an interaction between Rheb Tyr35-OH and the Î³-phosphate of GTP	 which hinders GTP hydrolysis. Interestingly	 our investigation of this inhibitory mechanism led to the elucidation of an unusual Rheb catalytic mechanism involving Asp65	 which is one position downstream of the canonical catalytic Gln	 equivalent to Ras Gln61 and Rho Gln63. In the canonical mechanism the catalytic water is activated/stabilized by interaction with an electronegative group	 the carboxamide oxygen of a glutamine	 provided either in cis or trans ( Bos et al.	 2007). Although an equivalent residue (Gln64) is present in the sequence of Rheb switch II	 our work demonstrates that the catalytic function is carried out by the adjacent Asp65. A Tyr residue in switch I is highly conserved among the GTPase superfamily; however	 the functional role of this residue varies. For example in RhoA	 Tyr34 stimulates intrinsic hydrolysis	 presumably by stabilizing the catalytic conformation of Gln63 in switch II	 whereas Ras Tyr32 is solvent exposed and does not impact the intrinsic hydrolysis (Figure S3). In Rheb	 Tyr35 counters the contribution of Asp65 to catalysis by restricting the dynamics of switch II and reducing its access to the catalytic site (Figure 6). Severe peak broadening was observed for the amides of Gly63	 Gln64	 Asp65	 and Glu66 in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the Y35A mutant (Figure 2H)	 presumably the result of disrupting the H bond network from Tyr35 to the amide of Gly63 through the catalytic water and the Î³-phosphate (Figure 2D). Moreover	 Tyr35 restricts the position of the hydrolytic water and reduces its polarization by the carbonyl of Thr38	 which is thought to promote hydrolysis (Buhrman et al.	 2010; Frech et al.	 1994). The residual catalytic activity found in Rheb D65A may reflect the stimulatory effect of the Thr38 backbone carbonyl in polarization and/or stabilization of the hydrolytic water. Upon mutation of Tyr35	 Asp65 adopts two conformations	 one of which is more proximal (relative to the WT) to the nucleotide-binding site and appears better positioned for hydrolysis (Figure 2G)	 consistent with our finding that mutation of Asp65 has a greater impact on the catalytic activity of Rheb Y35A than that of WT (Figure 3A). On the basis of the multiple crystallographic conformations of Asp65	 and the NMR peak broadening	 we propose that in both WT and Y35A Rheb	 switch II exists in an ensemble of conformations	 some of which allow Asp65 to adopt a catalytic conformation closer to the nucleotide.   Figure 6.  Schematic Model of Intrinsic and TSC2GAP-Stimulated GTP Hydrolysis by Rheb (A) In WT Rheb	 Tyr35 displaces the hydrolytic water away from the backbone carbonyl of Thr38	 reducing the polarization and reactivity of this water molecule. Furthermore	 Tyr35 reduces the electrostatic contribution of Asp65 to the GTP hydrolysis reaction by displacing this residue away from the nucleotide and the catalytic water. (B) Mutation of Tyr35 allows Asp65 and Thr38 to assemble a more efficient catalytic site. (C) Interaction of the GAP domain of TSC2 with Rheb may reduce the inhibitory effects of Tyr35	 allowing Asp65 to promote catalysis in synergy with the Asn thumb (Asn1643) provided in trans by TSC2GAP. See also Figure S6. Figure options Structural evidence implicating Asp as a catalytic residue exists for at least one other member of the GTPase superfamily	 the signal recognition particle (SRP) Ffh/FtsY (Focia et al.	 2004)	 which is a large dimeric prokaryotic GTPase that is highly divergent from the Ras family. Nevertheless	 to our knowledge	 a catalytic Asp has not been previously reported within the Ras subfamily. On the other hand the inhibitory role for a switch I Tyr we discovered in Rheb may be relevant in inhibiting the intrinsic hydrolytic machinery in certain other GTPases	 such as Ran (Brucker et al.	 2010). Our structural analysis of Rheb also shed further light on the mechanism of TSC2GAP-mediated hydrolysis of GTP. We propose that whereas providing an Asn thumb as a means of accelerating catalysis	 TSC2GAP may also stimulate the GTPase activity of Rheb by relieving autoinhibition and aligning Rheb's catalytic machinery (Figure 6C). Interaction of TSC2 with Rheb switch I may disrupt the electrostatic contact between Tyr35 and the Î³-phosphate	 reducing the autoinhibitory effect of this residue on GTP hydrolysis	 explaining the functional and thermodynamic similarities between WT Rheb in the presence of the TSC2GAP and the Rheb Y35A mutant alone. A common theme in GAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis is repositioning of the N terminus of switch II relative to the nucleotide-binding site to allow for efficient catalysis. For example the RanGAP Asn thumb serves to properly orient the catalytic Gln69 of Ran (Bos et al.	 2007; Seewald et al.	 2002). Similarly	 GAPIP4BP has been proposed to promote Rap GTP hydrolysis by repositioning a noncanonical catalytic glutamine residue	 Gln63	 located two positions C terminal to the position corresponding to Ras Gln61 (Sot et al.	 2010). In the case of Rheb	 we propose that Rheb-TSC2GAP interaction stabilizes Asp65 closer to the Î³-phosphate to catalyze GTP hydrolysis in synergy with the Asn thumb (Asn1643) provided by TSC2GAP. The delineation of the precise details of TSC2-mediated catalysis will require a more detailed structural analysis of the Rheb:TSC2GAP complex that is hindered by the transient nature of their interaction observed by us and others (Marshall et al.	 2009; Scrima et al.	 2008)	 preventing us from distinguishing impaired binding from impaired catalysis. The Tyr35-mediated autoinhibition of Rheb's GTPase reaction is necessary to maintain the appropriate level of activation of this small GTPase	 and thus mTORC1 signaling	 in response to growth factors. When growth factors are available	 TSC2GAP activity becomes limiting	 and Tyr35 inhibits GTP hydrolysis	 resulting in mTORC1 upregulation. In the absence of stimulation	 Rheb Tyr35 is required for productive TSC2GAP-mediated acceleration of GTP hydrolysis to shut down mTORC1 signaling. Indeed	 overexpression of Rheb Y35A substantially uncouples mTOR signaling from growth factors. In cells overexpressing WT Rheb	 mTOR signaling was strongly responsive to the availability of serum and insulin	 whereas this response was significantly dampened in cells overexpressing the Y35A mutant. To our knowledge	 this is the first example of a distinct mechanism of intrinsic nucleotide hydrolysis within the Ras subfamily	 which may be relevant to some other Ras superfamily GTPases	 particularly those that lack the canonical catalytic Gln in switch II (e.g.	 Rap GTPases). This study provides a view into an unusual mechanism of GTP hydrolysis by Rheb and an intriguing autoinhibitory interaction that blocks this GTPase reaction.    Aberrations in the mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) axis are frequently reported in cancer. Using publicly available tumor genome sequencing data	 we identified several point mutations in MTOR and its upstream regulator RHEB (Ras homolog enriched in brain) in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)	 the most common histology of kidney cancer. Interestingly	 we found a prominent cluster of hyperactivating mutations in the FAT (FRAP-ATM-TTRAP) domain of mTOR in renal cell carcinoma that led to an increase in both mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities and led to an increased proliferation of cells. Several of the FAT domain mutants demonstrated a decreased binding of DEPTOR (DEP domain containing mTOR-interacting protein)	 while a subset of these mutations showed altered binding of the negative regulator PRAS40 (proline rich AKT substrate 40). We also identified a recurrent mutation in RHEB in ccRCC patients that leads to an increase in mTORC1 activity. In vitro characterization of this RHEB mutation revealed that this mutant showed considerable resistance to TSC2 (Tuberous Sclerosis 2) GAP (GTPase activating protein) activity	 though its interaction with TSC2 remained unaltered. Mutations in the FAT domain of MTOR and in RHEB remained sensitive to rapamycin	 though several of these mutations demonstrated residual mTOR kinase activity after treatment with rapamycin at clinically relevant doses. Overall	 our data suggests that point mutations in the mTOR pathway may lead to downstream mTOR hyperactivation through multiple different mechanisms to confer a proliferative advantage to a tumor cell.  Keywords: mTOR	 RHEB	 rapamycin	 renal cancer	 mutations Go to: INTRODUCTION mTOR is a conserved serine/threonine kinase that integrates intracellular and extracellular signals to regulate vital cellular processes such as growth	 proliferation and metabolism [1]. One of the primary characteristics of a tumor cell is its ability to disconnect growth-promoting processes from the perception of growth signals. Hence it is not surprising that elevated mTOR signaling has been detected in several cancers [2]. Recent deep sequencing efforts have identified point mutations in MTOR in various cancers	 though it remains to be assessed if these are driver mutations causally implicated in oncogenesis [3	 4]. Understanding the regulation of the mTOR pathway is of paramount importance in renal cancer as inhibitors of mTOR (everolimus and temsirolimus) which are structural analogs of rapamycin are clinically approved for the treatment of advanced metastatic cancer.  The mTOR protein exists in two distinct multi-protein complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2 [5]. RAPTOR (regulatory associated protein of mTOR) and RICTOR (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR) are unique scaffolding proteins that assemble the complexes and bind the substrates for mTORC1 and mTORC2	 respectively [6	 7]. Unique components also exist in each complex: mTORC1 comprises a negative regulator	 PRAS40	 whereas mTORC2 contains PROTOR (protein observed with rictor 1 and 2) and mSIN1(mammalian stress-activated map kinase-interacting protein 1) [8-10]. mTORC1 and mTORC2 share mLST8(mammalian lethal with sec-13) and the negative regulator DEPTOR [11	 12]. The complex in which mTOR participates dictates the substrate specificity of its kinase activity. S6K1 (S6 Kinase 1) and 4E-BP1 (eIF-4E binding protein 1) are two well-characterized mTORC1 substrates that associate with mRNAs and regulate both mRNA translation initiation and progression	 thus enhancing protein synthesis [13	 14]. As such	 mTOR is normally subject to stringent regulation by nutrient conditions [15]. The heterodimer consisting of TSC1 (tuberous sclerosis 1; also known as hamartin) and TSC2 (tuberous sclerosis 2; also known as tuberin) is a key upstream regulator of mTORC1 and functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for RHEB [16]. The GTP-bound form of RHEB directly interacts with mTORC1 and strongly stimulates its kinase activity. As a RHEB GAP	 TSC1/2 negatively regulates mTORC1 by converting RHEB into its inactive GDP-bound state [17]. mTORC2 substrates include members of the AGC (protein kinase A/protein kinase G/protein kinase C) family that regulate cell survival and cell cycle progression. One of the most well characterized downstream targets of mTORC2 is AKT. mTORC2 directly activates AKT by phosphorylating its hydrophobic motif (Ser473)	 a site required for its maximal activation [18].  Using publicly available databases of cancer genome sequence data	 we examined a cluster of mutations in MTOR specific to RCC located in the FAT domain of mTOR and a point mutation in the RHEB gene [19	 20]. These activating mutations demonstrate that multiple mechanisms may lead to mTOR hyperactivation. Our data demonstrate that mutations in the FAT domain of mTOR promote mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity. Morevoer	 we demonstrate that cancer-associated MTOR mutations in the FAT domain confer a proliferative advantage over wild type MTOR. Finally	 our data demonstrate that these mutations can promote persistent mTOR activity despite rapalog therapy. Therefore	 these data have clinical implications given the widespread use of rapalog therapy for advanced RCC and the high prevalence of MTOR mutations in this malignancy.  Go to: RESULTS Point mutations are clustered in various regulatory domains of mTOR in ccRCC patients and are associated with poor prognosis  We analyzed cancer genomic sequence data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) using the COSMIC (the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer) (http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk) and cBIO Cancer genomics portal [19-21] and found that mutations in MTOR were prevalent in about 6% of the patients with ccRCC while mutations in RHEB are relatively uncommon and present in about 1% of the patients with RCC. As with other cancers	 some of these mutations clustered in key regulatory domains of mTOR such as the kinase domain and the FRB (FKBP12 rapamycin binding) domains (Table (Table11 and Figure Figure1a).1a). Mapping the RCC-associated mutations on the three-dimensional structure of mTOR (PDB ID code: 4JSN) reveals a cluster of mutations within the core of the kinase domain	 as well as several mutations distributed across the surface of the kinase domain that mediate interactions with the FAT domain (Figure (Figure1b1b).  Figure 1 Figure 1 Point mutations in MTOR are clustered in various regulatory domains in ccRCCC and are associated with poor prognosis Table 1 Table 1 Point mutations in mTOR from patients with ccRCC were annotated from the TCGA and represented by their respective domains The recently elucidated crystal structure of mTOR [22] revealed that the FAT domain contains 28 Î±-helices arranged as Î±-Î±-helical repeats (Figure (Figure1b).1b). Helices Î±1 to Î±22 belong to the Tetratricopeptide (TPR) repeat family and form three discontinuous domains (TRD1	 TRD2 and TRD3). Helices Î±23 to Î±28 belong to the HEAT family and form a single domain (HRD). The four domains pack sequentially to form a â€˜Câ€™-shaped Î±-solenoid that wraps halfway around the kinase domain and clamps onto it. mLST8 and the FRB domain protrude from the kinase domain	 on opposite sides of the catalytic cleft. The FATC domain is integral to the kinase domain structure. TRD1 interacts with the C lobe on one side of the kinase domain	 and after TRD2 and TRD3 traverse to the other side	 the HRD interacts with both the N lobe and the C lobe of the kinase domain.  The mutations cluster in the first of three discontinuous domains (TRD1)	 which forms intimate interactions with the C-lobe of the kinase domain. This led us to hypothesize that mutations in the FAT domain of mTOR may lead to deregulation of mTOR kinase activity	 possibly by disrupting autoinhibitory interactions and/or scaffolding sites for accessory proteins associated with the mTOR complexes. Interestingly	 sequence data from 418 ccRCC patients analyzed by the cBIO portal revealed that patients with mTOR mutations exhibited a significant decrease in overall survival (Figure (Figure1c)1c) suggesting that mutations in MTOR have prognostic significance.  FAT domain mutations lead to mTOR hyperactivation  Two previous reports have examined the role of mTOR mutations in cancer. In the first report	 the authors examined six hyperactivating mutations reported in various cancers and identified a hyperactivating mutation (R2505P) in RCC [23]. In the second report	 the authors examined the effects of recurrent mutations in various domains of mTOR and analyzed them with respect to their sensitivity to rapamycin [24]. Intuitively	 most of the mutations reported in various cancer genome databases cluster in key regulatory domains	 such as the FRB and kinase domains of mTOR. However	 very little is known about the regulatory roles of other domains of mTOR and how mutations in them could alter global mTOR function and complex assembly. Based on these findings	 we focused on the FAT domain cluster of MTOR mutants and compared its in vitro effects to another previously characterized mutant (R2505P) in the kinase domain [23].  To assess the sensitivity of FAT domain mutants of mTOR to upstream signaling by nutrients	 we examined the effect of these mutations under nutrient replete conditions and in the absence of both serum and amino acids. We find that FAT domain mutants promote mTORC1 activation as demonstrated by the increased phosphorylation of endogenous S6K and its downstream target S6	 relative to wild-type mTOR (Figure 2a and 2b	 Supplemental Figures 1-3). These data are consistent with studies by Grabiner et al. which demonstrated that mTOR FAT domain mutants promoted phosphorylation of a cotransfected S6K1 cDNA construct [24]. Although the mTOR pathway is subject to regulation by nutrient conditions	 recent studies indicate that mTORC1 phosphorylation sites have differential sensitivity to nutrients and rapamycin. The substrate quality affects how mTORC1 substrates respond to both pharmacological and natural regulators of the kinase. For example	 sites such as S6K Thr389 and 4E-BP1 Ser65 are nutrient sensitive whereas 4E-BP1 Thr37/47 is relative resistant to regulation by nutrient conditions and rapamycin [25]. Our data demonstrate that mTOR FAT domain mutants promote 4E-BP1 phosphorylation at the nutrient sensitive site Ser65 in the presence of nutrients (Figure (Figure2c	2c	 Supplemental Figures 1-3). FAT domain mutants also promote increased phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at the nutrient resistant Thr 37/46 residue in both the presence and absence of serum and amino acids (Figure (Figure2d	2d	 Supplemental Figure 3). Similar findings at Thr 37/46 were found in HeLa and NIH/3T3 cells under nutrient replete conditions (Supplemental Figures 1 and 2). Overall	 our data demonstrate that point mutations in the FAT domain lead to activation at both rapamycin/nutrient sensitive and resistant outputs of mTORC1.  Figure 2 Figure 2 Mutations in the FAT domain promote mTORC1 activation Point mutations in the FAT domain of mTOR lead to increased mTORC2 in vitro kinase activity  mTORC1 and mTORC2 have been shown to play critical yet functionally distinct roles. While the functional consequences of mTORC1 activation and its downstream targets are well defined	 the role of mTORC2 activation in general and its role in tumorigenesis is less established. Prior reports that have examined point mutations in mTOR	 demonstrate mTORC1 activation [23	 26]. In general	 we found that FAT domain mutants led to a modest increase in mTORC2 activity as determined by ser473 phosphorylation of AKT (Figure (Figure3a).3a). Basal AKT phosphorylation at Ser473 is high in HEK293T cells. Phosphorylation of AKT at Ser473 in the carboxy-terminal hydrophobic motif	 either by mTOR [18] or by DNA-PK [27]	 stimulates full AKT activity. While mTORC2 is primarily responsible for this phosphorylation event	 Ser473 phosphorylation is a more accurate marker of PI3K activity than mTORC2 [28]. Moreover	 alternate kinases may promote phosphorylation at this site [29]. We therefore examined de novo AKT phosphorylation by mTORC2 by an in vitro kinase assay using recombinant AKT as a substrate. Our data clearly demonstrate that FAT domain mutations of mTOR lead to an increase in mTORC2 kinase activity relative to wild-type mTOR (Figure (Figure3b).3b). Interestingly	 several of the point mutants that were previously reported to selectively phosphorylate mTORC1 substrates(L1460P	 C1483F	 and R2505P) clearly demonstrate increased mTORC2 kinase activity relative to wild-type mTOR (Figure (Figure3b)3b) [24].  Figure 3 Figure 3 Mutations in the FAT domain promote mTORC2 kinase activity mTOR hyperactivating mutants demonstrate increased rates of cell proliferation  mTOR has emerged as a critical node through which cells coordinate growth signals and nutrient availability to the macromolecular synthesis of proteins	 lipids and nucleic acids [30]. mTORC1 coordinates mRNA translation by phosphorylating components of the translational machinery: the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding proteins (4E-BPs) and the ribosomal S6 kinases (S6Ks) 1 and 2 [31]. It has been proposed that	 while the 4E-BPs mediate cell proliferation downstream of mTORC1	 the S6Ks regulate cell growth through complementary but distinct mechanisms [32]. As mTOR is a key regulator of cell growth and proliferation	 we examined the effect of mutations in the FAT domain of mTOR on cell proliferation. In vitro	 HEK293T cells expressing the mTOR FAT domain mutants K1452N	 L1460P	 C1483Y	 and A1519T showed significantly higher rates of cell proliferation in comparison to cells expressing wild-type mTOR	 similar to the kinase domain mutant R2505P (Figure (Figure4).4). Our data demonstrates for the first time that mTOR FAT domain mutants confer a proliferative advantage relative to wild-type mTOR.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Mutations in the FAT domain of mTOR promote increased cell proliferation relative to wild-type mTORC1/2 hyperactivating mutants demonstrate differential complex assembly  One potential mechanism by which mutations in mTOR might impact kinase activity is by altering mTORC1 and mTORC2 complex assembly. To test this hypothesis	 we transiently overexpressed wild-type and mutant mTOR in HEK293T cells and immunoprecipitated the mTOR complex using the myc epitope. In contrast to the previous findings	 we observed that a few of the FAT domain mutants (L1460P and C1483Y) had lower levels of RAPTOR in the immunoprecipitates in comparison to wild-type mTOR (Figure (Figure5)5) [24]. By binding to RAPTOR	 PRAS40 is known to regulate mTORC1 kinase activity by functioning as a direct inhibitor of substrate binding [33]. We examined the immunoprecipitates from wild-type and mutant mTOR for levels of PRAS40. Notably	 the same mutants demonstrated a loss of PRAS40 binding. Our data thus suggests that some of the mutations in the FAT domain of mTOR may preferentially lead to an increased phosphorylation of mTORC1 substrates due to loss of PRAS40 binding.  Figure 5 Figure 5 Mutations in the FAT domain of mTOR lead to altered DEPTOR and PRAS40 binding In addition	 we also observed an alteration in the levels of RICTOR in the immunoprecipitates from mutant mTOR in comparison to its wild-type counterpart (Figure (Figure5).5). RICTOR is a conserved scaffolding protein that regulates the recruitment of substrates to the mTORC2 complex [18	 34]. Our mTORC2 complex immunoprecipitation data correlates with our results from the in vitro kinase assay in that mutants with higher in vitro kinase activity (L1433S	 L1460P	 and C1483Y) have high RICTOR levels in immunproprecipitates. Notably	 the R2505P mutant did not demonstrate an increase in RICTOR binding. These data indicate that mutations in the FAT domain of mTOR may lead to an overall increase in mTORC2 kinase activity due to better recruitment of mTORC2 substrates via enhanced RICTOR association. As previously reported	 we observed a loss of DEPTOR binding in several of the FAT domain mutants relative to wild-type mTOR (Figure (Figure5)5) [24]. As DEPTOR is an intrinsic inhibitor common to mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes	 these findings further substantiate our results from the mTORC2 in vitro kinase assay. Overall	 the immunoprecipitation experiments from cells over expressing wild-type and mutant mTOR suggest that point mutations in mTOR may act through several mechanisms to increase the phosphorylation of downstream mTORC1 and mTORC2 targets.  FAT domain mutations in mTOR confer relative resistance to mTOR pathway inhibitors  Recent studies have indicated that mutations of the mTOR pathway may have therapeutic implications. This is particularly relevant as rapalogs are currently used for the treatment of advanced RCC [35]. Prior studies in cell lines have implicated mTOR mutations as conferring sensitivity to rapamycin [24]. However	 a recent case report implicated mTOR mutation (F2108L) as a mechanism of acquired resistance to allosteric inhibition by the rapalog everolimus [36]. These data prompted us to examine the effects of rapamycin on mTORC1 activity in cells expressing the hyperactivating FAT domain mutants. To assess the sensitivity of mTOR mutants to rapalogs	 we treated the cells with rapamycin at 10nM which is comparable to trough levels of patients with advanced RCC treated with everolimus [37]. While the mTORC1 activity of FAT domain mutants was inhibitable by rapamycin	 multiple mutants demonstrated residual activity as determined by S6K phosphorylation (Figure (Figure6a).6a). With higher doses of rapamycin	 this residual activity could be abolished (Figure (Figure6b).6b). To assess the sensitivity of these mutants to rapamycin we also measured proliferation of these cells expressing mutant mTOR relative to wild-type over expressing cells in the presence of rapamycin. Notably	 HEK293T cells expressing FAT domain mutants (L1460P and C1483Y) demonstrated higher rates of cell proliferation in comparison to wild-type mTOR expressing cells in the presence of clinically relevant doses of rapamycin (Figure (Figure6c6c).  Figure 6 Figure 6 Mutations in the FAT domain of mTOR lead to decreased sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of rapamycin at clinically relevant doses A point mutation in RHEB leads to mTOR activation in a subset of patients with RCC  In the abundance of growth factors activation of the PI3K(phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) activates and phosphorylates AKT	 that in turn leads to the downstream phosphorylation of TSC2 and inhibits its GAP activity towards RHEB	 allowing RHEB to activate mTOR [38	 39]. Amino acids on the other hand signal to mTORC1 through the Rag family of GTPases	 by mediating the activation of mTOR by RHEB at the lysosome [12	 40]. Our analysis of cancer genome databases	 also led us to identify a recurrent point mutation in RHEB (Y35N)	 reported in RCC and in several other cancers [41	 42]. RHEB is responsive to growth factors	 but	 in conjunction with PLD1 (phospholipase D1)	 is also an integral part of the machinery that stimulates mTORC1 in response to amino acids [43]. In the simplest model	 GTP-bound RHEB either stimulates the kinase activity of mTORC1 via direct interaction or induces a conformational change in mTORC1 that results in enhanced substrate turnover [44]. RHEB has an unusually slow intrinsic GTPase activity	 which is regulated by the GAP activity of TSC2 [45]. Previous data utilizing site-directed mutagenesis	 crystallography	 and real-time NMR-based GTPase assays suggest that RHEB Tyr35 is a structurally critical residue that is highly conserved across the small GTPase superfamily [46]	 but has unique functions in RHEB. Tyr35 was found to maintain the high activation state of RHEB by inhibiting intrinsic GTP hydrolysis	 however it was also found to be required for sensitivity to the GAP activity of TSC2 [47].  To assess the role of a point mutation in RHEB at the conserved Tyr35 site	 we generated a point mutation (Y35N) and transiently over expressed wild-type and mutant RHEB in HEK293T cells. As RHEB is a key mediator of the amino acid sensing mechanism of the cell	 we examined the effect of this mutant in the presence and absence of amino acids. Mutant RHEB caused promoted mTORC1 activation under nutrient containing conditions	 an effect that remained under nutrient deprived conditions as demonstrated by persistent phosphorylation of S6K and 4E-BP1 (Figure (Figure7a).7a). RHEB stimulates mTORC1 phosphorylation of S6K and 4E-BP1 in a rapamycin-sensitive manner [48]. To determine the mechanism by which a point mutation in RHEB might lead to downstream mTORC1 activation	 we first examined whether mutant RHEB altered assembly of mTOR complexes by immunoprecipitating endogenous mTOR complexes using an anti-mTOR antibody from cells overexpressing wild-type or mutant RHEB. As expected	 overexpression of mutant RHEB did not alter the association of RAPTOR or RICTOR	 indicating the mutation does not impact mTORC1 or mTORC2 assembly	 respectively (Figure (Figure7b7b).  Figure 7 Figure 7 Y35N RHEB mutation in ccRCC causes mTORC1 hyperactivation by resistance to TSC2 GAP activity The TSC1/TSC2 complex interacts with RHEB and inactivates it through the activity of a GAP domain in TSC2. Thus we performed immunoprecipitation experiments to analyze the interactions of wild-type and mutant FLAG-tagged RHEB with TSC2. The RHEB mutation did not affect interaction with TSC2 (Figure (Figure7b).7b). RHEB has very low intrinsic GTPase activity and our previous results have shown that the Y35 residue autoinhibits intrinsic GTP hydrolysis [47]. Using a real-time NMR-based GTPase assay	 we previously found that mutation of Y35 to alanine or phenylalanine disrupted this autoinhibitory mechanism and accelerated intrinsic GTP hydrolysis several fold	 while simultaneously rendering it insensitive to the GAP activity of TSC2 [47]. Similar to the engineered Y35A and Y35F mutations	 we found that the cancer-associated Y35N RHEB mutation increased the rate of intrinsic GTP hydrolysis by ~2.5 fold	 due to release of the autoinhibitory function of Y35. Subsequently we tested the sensitivity of the GTPase activity of Y35N RHEB to the action of the TSC2 GAP domain. While the rate of GTP hydrolysis of wild-type RHEB was increased 50-fold in the presence of the GAP domain of TSC2	 the Y35N mutant exhibited complete resistance to the GAP domain of TSC2 with no detectable effect on GTP hydrolysis (Figure (Figure7c).7c). As expected	 the RHEB mutant demonstrated somewhat higher levels of intrinsic GTP hydrolysis	 however acquired resistance to the GAP activity of TSC2 has a more profound impact of RHEB function	 thus leading to hyperactivation of mTORC1 under starvation conditions where TSC2 is active.  RHEB activation of S6K and 4E-BP1 is known to be rapamycin-sensitive [48]. To determine the rapamycin sensitivity associated with this RHEB mutant	 we transiently overexpressed wild-type and mutant RHEB and examined the phosphorylation of mTOR targets after acute rapamycin treatment. While mTORC1 activity in cells expressing the RHEB mutant remained sensitive to rapamycin	 higher levels of phosphorylated S6K after rapamycin treatment were observed with the mutant than wild-type RHEB (Figure (Figure7d7d).  Go to: DISCUSSION mTOR deregulation is observed in multiple sporadic cancer types; however	 it also plays a causative role in various familial tumor syndromes such as Cowden syndrome	 Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and Tuberous Sclerosis as recently summarized [49]. In sporadic cancers	 mTOR activation is frequently the result of amplification/activating mutations in genes encoding upstream RTK's (receptor tyrosine kinases [50]	 activating mutations of PI3KCA (i.e.	 the gene encoding the PI3K catalytic subunit p110Î±) [51] or deletion/inactivation of tumor suppressors	 including PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) [52]	 LKB1 (liver kinase B1) [53]	 and the protein phosphatase PP2A	 which dephosphorylates and inactivates AKT [54].  Recent cancer genome sequencing efforts have led to the identification of point mutations in mTOR. In this study	 we chose to characterize a group of mutations in the TRD1 and TRD2 regions of the FAT domain that cluster distal from the kinase domain. While mutations in these regions could directly disrupt the binding sites for mTOR complex proteins that interact with the FAT domain	 these mutation sites are not surface exposed. The FAT domain is comprised of helices arranged in Î±-Î±-helical repeats that form a C-shaped solenoid that surrounds the kinase domain. These mutation sites are found at the interfaces between adjacent helices	 thus we propose these RCC-associated mutations are likely to destabilize the structure of the FAT domain. This may directly deregulate mTOR kinase activity as well as affect the binding of mTOR complex proteins. The binding of DEPTOR	 which interacts with the FAT domain	 was impaired by four of the six mutations characterized in this study. The side chain of L1433 in Î±3 is involved in hydrophobic interactions with the alkyl region of K1452 in Î±4	 which appears to stabilize the orientation of helices 3 and 4	 and would be disrupted by the L1433S or K1452N mutations. Likewise	 the side chains of Y1463 in Î±5 and C1483 in Î±6 are intimately involved in the Î±5-Î±6 interhelical packing	 which could be disrupted by loss of an aromatic ring (Y1463S) or steric clashes (C1483F). L1460 is in the middle of Î±5	 thus its mutation to the helix-breaker residue proline would be expected to destabilize these helical bundles	 as would the adjacent mutation A1459P. A1519	 located in Î±8	 packs into a small cavity formed by Î±7 that would not accommodate a larger sidechain. Thus the Î±7-Î±8 this bundle would likely be disrupted by the A1519T mutation. Mechanistically	 we find that in addition to altering mTORC1 and mTORC2 complex assembly	 FAT domain mutations also lead to a decrease in PRAS40 and DEPTOR binding	 suggesting that multiple mechanisms may act in concert to activate downstream mTOR targets.  Additionally	 we examined a recurrent point mutation in RHEB that caused mTORC1 hyperactivation by conferring resistance to the GAP activity of TSC2. Mutations in RHEB are uncommon in many cancers	 despite its central role in regulating downstream mTOR activation. In RCC	 a recurrent mutation in RHEB at the Tyr35 residue has been reported	 though it is unclear if this mutation is mutually exclusive to mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 as the mutation frequencies amongst these genes is low. The recurrent mutation of RHEB Y35 in cancers underscores the importance of this residue	 and illustrates that the unique biochemical properties of RHEB lead to a different mutational hotspot relative to RAS	 in which the majority of mutations affect G12	 G13 and Q61. Indeed	 the equivalent positions in RHEB are either already substituted in the wild-type sequence (R15 and S16)	 or lack a catalytic function (Q64). It is notable that while oncogenic RAS mutations synergistically impair both intrinsic hydrolysis and GAP sensitivity	 the RHEB Y35N mutation enhances intrinsic hydrolysis but abolishes sensitivity to the GAP. Overall	 our results suggest that mutations in the TSC-RHEB-mTOR signaling axis may lead to a loss of inhibitory inputs thus conferring a survival advantage to a dividing tumor cell.  Our findings have several implications for patients with RCC. The finding that MTOR mutations are associated with worsened outcomes has prognostic relevance and suggests that this event may be a significant contributor to tumor progression. Consistent with this possibility is our data demonstrating the first evidence that cancer-associated MTOR mutations promote a proliferative advantage over wild type MTOR. The TCGA data set are from primary RCC tumor samples. In the setting of RCC	 the morbidity and mortality is primarily associated with disease outside the kidney. Hence	 the incidence of MTOR mutations may be much higher in metastatic tumor sites which would further support a role for this genetic alteration in tumor progression. Additionally	 our data may have therapeutic implications. Approved mTOR inhibitors temsirolimus and everolimus serve as important therapeutic options within the current RCC treatment paradigm	 though they primarily target the mTORC1 pathway. Biomarkers for rapamycin sensitivity/resistance are lacking. Our results suggest that FAT domain mutations may potentially lead to resistance to rapalog therapy in patients with ccRCC. Notably	 a recent case report in anaplastic thyroid cancer suggests that MTOR mutation is a mechanism of acquired resistance to rapalog therapy [55]. Sequencing of the pretreatment tumor demonstrated a nonsense TSC2 mutation. After significant response to everolimus	 the patient developed resistant tumor that had a MTOR kinase domain mutation (F2108L). Such resistance may occur in the setting of FAT domain mutations and could occur via several mechanisms as supported by our data. First	 higher doses of rapamycin may be required to ablate rapamycin sensitive outputs of mTORC1. Prior in vitro studies have examined the rapamycin sensitivity of mTORC1 activation mediated by mTOR point mutants. However	 in many cases	 the doses used are much higher than serum rapalog levels in patients undergoing treatment in the setting of advanced RCC. The recent case report in thyroid cancer demonstrated persistent mTORC1 activity of the F2108L mutant at physiologically relevant rapamycin concentrations is consistent with our studies of FAT domain mutants. Additionally	 it is now well established that there are mTORC1 activities that are not inhibitable by rapamycin. Our data demonstrate enhanced phosphorylation of such (e.g. 4E-BP1 Thr 37/46). Finally	 mTOR FAT domain mutants can promote mTORC2 kinase activity-a critical finding given that rapalogs generally do not ablate mTORC2 activity [56]. Hence	 our findings suggest that alternative strategies may need to be considered in the setting of MTOR mutation. Dosing adjustments could be considered. Alternatively	 strategies that target rapamycin resistant activities of mTOR mediated by mTORC1 or mTORC2 (e.g ATP competitive inhibitors) could be considered.  In summary	 our findings shed new insight into the biology of mTOR as it pertains to kidney cancer. While mTOR is one of the largest genes in the human genome	 the mutations in mTOR are clustered within finite regulatory domains suggesting that these mutations lead to a gain of function which is currently an area of active investigation. Characterizing these mutations and their sensitivity to targeted agents could thus be clinically relevant	 especially with the increasing use of whole genome sequencing to direct therapy in patients with advanced cancer.  																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										
7	69||Genes encoding components of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling axis are frequently mutated in cancer	 but few mutations have been characterized in MTOR	 the gene for the mTOR kinase. Using publicly available tumor genome sequencing data	 we generated a comprehensive catalog of mTOR pathway mutations in cancer	 identifying 33 MTOR mutations that confer pathway hyperactivation. The mutations cluster in six distinct regions in the C-terminal half of mTOR and occur in multiple cancer types	 with one cluster particularly prominent in kidney cancer. The activating mutations do not affect mTOR complex assembly	 but a subset reduces binding to the mTOR inhibitor Deptor. mTORC1 signaling in cells expressing various activating mutations remains sensitive to pharmacological mTOR inhibition	 but is partially resistant to nutrient deprivation. Lastly	 cancer cell lines with hyperactivating MTOR mutations display heightened sensitivity to rapamycin both in culture and as in vivo xenografts	 suggesting that such mutations confer mTOR pathway dependency.  Keywords: personalized	 mTOR	 mutations	 biomarker	 deptor Go to: Introduction In mammals	 the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway regulates cell size	 mRNA translation	 autophagy and many metabolic processes	 including lipid synthesis (1). A variety of upstream regulators control the activity of the serine/threonine protein kinase mTOR and many of these are deregulated in cancer	 resulting in pathway hyperactivation. Such activation occurs most commonly through loss-of-function mutations in tumor suppressors	 such as phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)	 tuberous sclerosis 1/2 (TSC1/2)	 neurofibromin 1/2 (NF1/2)	 or oncogenic mutations in KRAS	 PIK3CA	 or AKT (2). However	 few cancer-associated mutations have been functionally characterized in MTOR itself	 with only two reports thus far describing such mutations. In the first report	 the authors tested six cancer-associated MTOR mutations and observed that two (S2215Y from a colorectal sample and R2505P from a kidney sample) conferred mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activation (3). In the second report	 the authors identified an mTORC1 activating MTOR mutation (L2431P) that was present in a portion but not the entirety of a primary kidney tumor (4). Although these initial reports establish that activating MTOR mutations do arise in cancer	 they were based upon limited sample sets that do not reflect the diverse subtypes of cancer. More recently	 cancer genome sequencing projects	 such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE)	 have identified a vast number of somatic mutations in thousands of tumors from more than 40 cancer subtypes (5-7).  Using publicly available databases of cancer genome sequence data	 we cataloged all mutations in mTOR pathway components. We annotated over 400 samples with missense mutations in the MTOR gene from dozens of cancer subtypes	 most of which lie within six clusters in the part of the gene that encodes the C-terminal portion of mTOR. Furthermore	 through functional analyses	 we identify 33 novel mTOR pathway-activating mutations	 some of which affect the capacity of mTOR to interact with its partner proteins. None of the activating mutations impact the sensitivity of mTORC1 activity in cells to mTOR inhibitors but a subset confer mTORC1 signaling resistance to nutrient deprivation. Importantly	 cancer cells that naturally express a subset of the mutations are hypersensitive to the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. These findings may have translational relevance as rapamycin analogs (rapalogs) are clinically approved for the treatment of cancer	 and several ATP-competitive mTOR kinase inhibitors are in development (8). As tumor biopsies are increasingly subjected to whole exome sequencing	 the hyperactivating MTOR mutations we characterize may serve as biomarkers in predicting cancer response to mTOR-targeting drugs.  Go to: Results Catalog of recurring mutations in genes encoding mTOR pathway components  To generate a comprehensive catalog of all cancer-associated missense mutations in canonical genes of the mTOR pathway	 we analyzed partial genome sequencing data from the TCGA	 CCLE	 International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) databases (5-7	9	 10). This analysis revealed that almost every gene in the mTOR pathway harbored somatic point mutations (Supplementary Table 1). To enrich for mutations that are more likely to affect pathway function	 only mutations that alter the same codon more than once were counted. When normalized for gene length	 this analysis revealed that MTOR contained the highest percentage of recurring mutations	 and thus we focused most of our attention on these mutations (Supplementary Figure 1). Collectively	 through data mining and a literature search	 we curated over 400 samples with non-synonymous MTOR point mutations (Figure 1B and Supplementary Table 2) (11-17). While the majority of these mutations are represented by only one sample in our database	 approximately 40% are recurrent	 most of which have not been previously described. Additionally	 the mutations cluster in six distinct regions of mTOR centered on highly recurrent mutations that alter amino acids C1483	 E1799	 T1977	 S2215	 L2427 and R2505 (Figure 1C). The presence of these clusters suggests that there is a selective advantage to acquiring mutations in certain regions of the mTOR protein. Furthermore	 these mutations are present in multiple cancer subtypes	 with the highest number in colorectal	 endometrial	 and lung cancers	 although these cancer subtypes are also considered to have the highest mutation rates (Figures 1D and 1E) (18). Interestingly	 a random mutagenesis screen in the S. pombe mTOR homolog (tor2) identified activating mutations in homologous amino acid positions to many of those we find in MTOR to be recurrently mutated in cancer (19) (Supplementary Table 3).  Figure 1 Figure 1 Cancer-associated MTOR mutations mTORC1/2 activating mutations in MTOR  The prevalence of the recurrent mutations	 their clustering	 and correlation with activating tor2 mutations strongly suggested that the MTOR mutations impact mTOR pathway activity. To test this possibility	 wild-type (WT) or ten different mutants of mTOR (L1460P	 C1483F	 E1799K	 F1888L	 T1977R	 V2006I	 S2215Y	 I2500F	 R2505P	 and D2512H) were expressed in cells and phosphorylation of the mTORC1/2 substrates S6K1	 4EBP1	 or Akt1 examined (Figures 2A	 2B	 and 2C). All the mTOR mutants conferred varying degrees of pathway activation	 and	 interestingly	 a few displayed some substrate preference (L1460P	 C1483F	 S2215Y	 and R2505P towards S6K1/4EBP1 or V2006I towards Akt1)	 implying that these mutations have greater effects on mTORC1 or mTORC2. Thus	 while three pathway activating MTOR mutations have previously been identified (3	 4)	 our initial analyses uncovered an additional eight recurrent MTOR mutations which activate mTORC1 and/or mTORC2.  Figure 2 Figure 2 mTORC1 and mTORC2 activating mutations in MTOR and RHEB It is well established that two activating mutations (E545K and H1047R) within the phosphatidylinositol-4	5-bisphosphate 3-kinase	 catalytic subunit alpha (PI3K-p110Î±)	 encoded by the PIK3CA gene	 can lead to mTOR pathway activation (20). To determine the degree of mTOR pathway activation conferred by mTOR mutation	 S6K1 phosphorylation from cells expressing WT or S2215Y mTOR was compared to cells expressing WT or mutant PI3K-p110Î± (Supplementary Figures 2A and 2B). This revealed that while expression of only mutant mTOR conferred mTORC1 activation	 expression of either WT or mutant PI3K-p110Î± induced mTORC1 activity.  Non-recurrent MTOR mutations that activate mTORC1 signaling  We next examined in more detail the nature of the activating MTOR mutations	 and observed that while some codons are mutated to only one other residue (e.g. E1799K)	 others are mutated to several different amino acids (e.g. S2215F/P/T/Y). This is reminiscent of the diverse amino acids to which the G12 residue of KRAS is mutated in cancers (21). We expressed 20 such MTOR mutations and found that many (C1483R/W/Y	 F1888I	 T1977K	 S2215F/P	 I2500M)	 but not all (A41P/S/T	 F1888V	 T1977S	 V2006L	 S2215T	 R2505Q/*	 D2512G/Y)	 led to increased S6K1 phosphorylation (Supplementary Figures 3 and 5	 and data not shown). Given that most of these activating mutations are found only once in our dataset implies that other non-recurrent mutations may also activate mTORC1 signaling. To identify other such mutations	 we turned our attention to the mutational clusters identified in Figure 1	 and observed that while most are represented by several tissue types	 those in the C1483 cluster are particularly prevalent in kidney cancer (Figure 1E and Supplementary Figure 3D). Interestingly	 two recent cancer genome sequencing efforts reported that kidney cancers have an increased percentage of mutations in mTOR pathway genes	 but the functional consequences of these mutations were not evaluated (13	 22). Expression of the ten kidney cancer-associated MTOR mutations from the C1483 cluster revealed that in addition to the previously evaluated L1460P and C1483F/Y mutants (Figure 1B and Supplemental Figure 2)	 three non-recurrent mutants (L1433S	 A1459P	 and E1519T) also induced mTORC1 pathway activity (Figure 2D). Similarly	 expression of eight non-recurrent mutations from the S2215 cluster (N2206S	 L2209V	 A2210P	 L2216P	 R2217W	 L2220F	 Q2223K	 and A2226S) activated mTORC1 signaling as measured by S6K1 phosphorylation	 with the L2209V mutant conferring higher activation than even S2215Y (Supplementary Figure 3E). Lastly	 other than the S2215Y and R2505P mutations	 the only other cancer-associated MTOR mutation previously characterized is L2431P from a kidney cancer patient (4). Expression of mTOR containing this non-recurrent mutation caused mTORC1 activation that was much weaker than that caused by expression of the S2215Y mutant (Supplementary Figure 3F). Collectively	 these results suggest that while most non-recurrent MTOR mutations found in cancer are part of the mutational â€œnoiseâ€	 there exists a diverse set of MTOR mutations that can drive mTORC1 pathway activity. Likely	 as more cancer genomes are sequenced	 the activating non-recurrent mutations we identified will prove to be recurrent.  Recurrent mutations in RHEB activate mTORC1  We also observed that other mTOR pathway genes such as Raptor	 Rictor	 and Rheb1 harbored recurrent mutations (Supplemental Table 1). Expression of Rheb1 Y35N/C/H and to a lesser degree E139K increased phosphorylation of endogenous S6K1 more than that of WT Rheb1 (Figure 2E)	 while recurrent mutations in Raptor (R788C) or Rictor (S1101L) failed to induce any mTORC1 or mTORC2 activity (data not shown). In support of the relevance of these mutations to cancer	 RHEB was recently highlighted as a novel cancer gene due to the presence of the Y35N mutation (23). Thus	 cancer associated mutations in either MTOR or RHEB can induce mTORC1 activity; whether this is true of other mTOR pathway genes remains to be determined.  mTORC1/2 hyperactivating mutants bind less Deptor  One potential mechanism through which the mutations in mTOR (Figure 2) might increase S6K1/Akt1 phosphorylation is by altering mTORC1 or mTORC2 assembly. Alternatively or in addition	 the mTOR mutations may diminish the binding of mTOR to its endogenous inhibitor Deptor	 which binds to the FAT domain of mTOR (24). To test these possibilities	 the interactions of exogenously expressed WT or mutant mTORs with endogenous Raptor	 Rictor	 and Deptor were measured. All mutant mTOR proteins bound equally well to Raptor and Rictor	 suggesting that the mutations do not affect formation of either mTOR complex (Figure 3A). In contrast	 Deptor binding to the immunoprecipitated mTOR proteins was reduced in cells expressing the mTOR mutants as compared to WT mTOR (Figure 3A). Given that increased mTOR pathway activity correlates with a reduction in the mTOR-Deptor interaction (24)	 it is likely that the observed decrease in Deptor binding reflects the increased mTOR pathway activity caused by the MTOR mutations. However	 two mTORC1 activating mutations that are in the FAT domain of mTOR	 L1460P and C1483Y	 bound much less Deptor than the other mutants tested (Figure 3A)	 suggesting that these mutations directly perturb the Deptor binding site on mTOR. Consistent with this	 examination of the mutations from the C1483 cluster described in figure 2D revealed that two other highly activating mutations in the FAT domain (A1459P and C1483Y) also strongly reduced the mTOR-Deptor interaction (Supplementary Figure 4A). While these results suggest a possible mechanism of action for a subset of activating mTOR mutations	 they do not preclude other mechanism by which MTOR mutations may impact mTORC1 signaling	 such as by increasing the activity of the mTOR kinase domain.  Figure 3 Figure 3 mTOR mutants bind less Deptor and cells expressing the mTOR S2215Y mutation are resistant to nutrient deprivation MTOR mutations do not affect mTORC1 sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors but can affect the pathway response to nutrient deprivation  We next considered the possibility that the mTORC1-activating MTOR mutants have altered sensitivity to established mTOR inhibitors. Engineered mutations in the FRB domain of mTOR	 which binds the FKBP12-rapamycin complex	 confer marked rapamycin resistance to mTOR (25). To test whether mTOR mutation alters pathway inhibition by rapamycin or Torin1 (an investigational ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor)	 we used HEK-293 cells with an integrated FLP recombination site (TREX cells) to stably express WT or several different mutants of mTOR (A1459P	 C1483Y	 E1799K	 F1888I	 L2209V	 S2215Y	 L2431P	 I2500F	 and R2505P)	 as the mTOR cDNA is too large to be packaged and expressed via a lentiviral delivery system (Supplementary Figure 4B). Baseline phosphorylation of endogenous S6K1 was higher in TREX cells expressing the A1459P	 L2209V	 S2215Y	 I2500F and R2505P mTOR mutants than in parental or WT-expressing cells (Figure 3B and Supplementary Figures 4C and 4D)	 consistent with the results obtained upon transient expression of these mutants (Figures 2A and 2D	 and Supplementary Figure 3D). Importantly	 mTORC1 activity in none of the TREX cells was resistant to rapamycin	 Torin1	 MLN0128 (an mTOR ATP-competitive inhibitor)	 GDC0980 (a dual PI3K/mTOR ATP-competitive inhibitor)	 (Figure 3B and Supplementary Figures 4C and 4D). Thus	 on a molecular level	 while cells with mTOR mutations may display high levels of mTORC1/2 activity	 this activity is still sensitive to pharmacological mTOR inhibition.  The kinase activity of mTOR is tightly regulated by nutrient availability; when cells are starved of nutrients (specifically glucose and amino acids)	 they downregulate mTORC1 signaling	 while retreatment of cells with these nutrients restores mTORC1-mediated signaling (26). Given this	 we sought to determine whether any of the activating mTOR mutants affect the sensitivity of mTORC1 signaling to amino acid or glucose withdrawal. Indeed	 S6K1 phosphorylation was highly resistant to deprivation of either nutrient in cells expressing several mutants (A1459P	 S2215Y	 I2500F and R2505P) (Figure 3C and Supplementary Figures 4E and 4F). This observation may be relevant in the context of developing tumors	 which are often glucose starved (27	 28)	 where inappropriate mTORC1 activity may provide a growth advantage.  Cancer cells with hyperactivating MTOR mutations are hypersensitive to rapamycin in vitro and in vivo  To determine if cancer cells with MTOR mutations are dependent on mTORC1 activity	 we evaluated the impact of rapamycin on the proliferation of set of cancer cell lines harboring WT or mutant mTOR (Figure 4A). We identified four cell lines with mTORC1-activating MTOR mutations (C1483Y in MOLT16; E1799K in HEC59 and SNU349; and S2215Y in JHUEM7) and two with MTOR mutations that have no apparent impact on mTORC1 signaling (V2006L in TUHR10TKB; and R2152C in A375) (Supplementary Figures 5A and 5B). HeLa cells were used as a negative control cell line	 as they are mildly rapamycin sensitive and are wild-type for mTOR (7	 29). MCF7 and SW780 cells	 which are also wild-type for mTOR	 served as positive controls for rapamycin sensitivity because the MCF7 cells harbor an activating PI3K-p110Î± mutation (E545K) while the SW780 cells lack NPRL2	 which encodes a component of the GATOR1 negative regulator of the amino acid-sensing pathway (30	 31). Importantly	 only the cell lines with activating MTOR mutations	 the PI3K-p110Î± mutant	 or the NPRL2-null SW780 cells were hypersensitive to rapamycin treatment (Figure 4B). Consistent with these and published results	 the growth of HeLa xenografts was partially rapamycin sensitive	 while rapamycin completely halted the growth of HEC59 xenografts	 which carry the hyperactivating mTOR E1799K mutation (Figure 4C) (32	 33). These results suggest that the presence of hyperactivating MTOR mutations in cancer cells may serve as biomarkers to identify tumors that are likely to respond to mTOR inhibitors.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Rapamycin inhibits the proliferation of cancer cell lines with hyperactivating MTOR mutations Go to: Discussion Early cancer genome sequencing projects led to the identification of three mutations in MTOR that were shown to activate mTORC1 signaling (3	 4). Here	 we have identified an additional 33 previously unknown activating MTOR mutations (some are recurrent	 others are not) (Supplementary Table 4). Mechanistically	 we find that the activating mutations diminish the mTOR-Deptor interaction and interestingly	 when mapped onto the recently solved crystal structure of mTOR	 the mutations cluster in several distinct locations within the protein itself	 suggesting that other activating mechanisms may exist (Supplementary Figure 6) (34). While the mutations do not prevent pharmacological mTOR inhibition	 a subset protect against the effects of nutrient deprivation on mTORC1 signaling. Lastly	 we demonstrate that cell lines with activating MTOR mutations are particularly sensitive to rapamycin in cell culture and in xenografts	 likely due to mTOR pathway dependency.  The diversity of activating MTOR mutations we characterized is reminiscent of the various activating mutations in the prototypical lipid kinase PIK3CA	 which encodes for the PI3K catalytic subunit p110Î± (35). However	 unlike the activating PIK3CA mutations	 which confer equal activation of PI3K-mediated signaling pathways	 the diverse MTOR mutations can differentially activate mTORC1 or mTORC2	 leading to either S6K1/4EBP1 or Akt1 phosphorylation	 respectively. This finding is particularly relevant in a clinical setting	 as patients with mTORC1 activating mutations may respond well to FDA-approved rapalogs	 while patients with mTORC2 activating mutations might best be treated with ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors	 although such inhibitors are still in clinical trials. This distinction is especially relevant for patients with mTORC2 activating mutations	 because rapalogs can in some cases upregulate mTORC2 signaling through modulation of an mTORC1-dependent feedback loop (36).  Rapalog-based therapies are currently approved or in clinical trials for several cancer subtypes	 and some patients have had dramatic and durable responses to these therapies (37). Given that some cells with activating MTOR mutations are particularly rapamycin sensitive (Figure 4)	 it is possible that some of the rapalog-responsive patients had tumors with similar mutations. Indeed	 it was recently found that the tumor of a bladder cancer patient with two activating MTOR mutations displayed exquisite sensitivity to rapalog-based therapy (38). Many more cancer-associated MTOR mutations will likely be identified in future studies	 but functional evaluation of these mutations will be required to determine their impact on the mTOR pathway. As tumor sequencing becomes more commonplace	 functional studies such as ours may aid in arriving at a more personalized treatment regimen that eventually promotes patient survival.  Go to: Methods Data acquisition and cluster analysis  All mutations in genes of the mTOR pathway were acquired from the cBIO	 COSMIC	 and ICGC databases or through a literature search with a data-freeze date of September 1	 2013. To identify regions of mTOR significantly enriched for somatic point mutations	 we determined the probability of seeing at least the observed number of mutations in a 50 amino acid sliding window with the null hypothesis being all 463 MTOR mutations randomly occurring across the 2549 amino acid protein. Specifically	 we calculated a threshold for significance of at least 15 mutations per 50 amino acids by the formula:  p=âˆ‘n=k463(463k)âˆ—(1âˆ’502549)463âˆ’kâˆ—(502549)k which equals 0.043 for k = at least 15 mutations per 50 amino acids.  Materials  Reagents were obtained from the following sources: antibodies to HA (clone C29F4)	 S6K1 (clone 49D7)	 phospho-T389-S6K1 (clone 108D2)	 and phospho-S473-Akt1 (clone D9E) from Cell Signaling Technology; antibody to GAPDH (clone GT239) from Genetex; antibodies to Deptor and Raptor	 X-ray film	 and PVDF membrane were from Millipore; antibody to Rictor from Bethyl; antibody to the Flag epitope (clone M2)	 Flag M2-coupled agarose beads	 glucose and amino acid mixtures from Sigma; horseradish-peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; FuGENE HD and Cell Titer Glo from Promega; X-tremeGENE 9 and Complete Protease Mixture from Roche Applied Science; QuikChange II XL from Stratagene; enhanced chemiluminescence reagent and glutathione-coupled agarose beads from Thermo; 8-week-old nude mice from Taconic; rapamycin from LC Labs; MLN0128 and GDC0980 from Selleckchem; and Torin1 was synthesized in the Gray laboratory (39). cDNAs for mTOR and PI3K-p110Î± were from Addgene; expression vectors for HAGST-S6K1	 HA-GST-Akt1	 and HA-GST-Rheb1 were described previously (24	40	 41) and Flag-14-3-3Î± was a generous gift from the Yaffe lab. The primers used to generate the mTOR and Rheb1 mutations were from Integrated DNA Technologies and are listed in supplemental table 5. HEK-293T-TREX cell system	 4-12% bis-tris SDS-PAGE gels	 and 20x MOPS buffers were from Invitrogen.  Tissue culture and cell lines  MCF7	 HELA	 HEK-293T	 HCT116	 A375 and SW780 cells were from ATCC; JHUEM7	 MOLT16	 NCIH446	 SNU349	 and TUHR10TKB cells were from the Broad Institute Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia; HEK-293E cells were a generous gift of the Blenis lab; and the HEC59 cells were a generous gift of the Lippard lab. The cell lines have not been re-authenticated	 although those from ATCC and the Broad were used within 6 months of resuscitation. The HEK-293T	 HEK-293E	 HCT116	 A375	 HEC59	 and TUHR10TKB cells were cultured in DMEM; JHUEM7 and MOLT16 cells were cultured in RPMI; and the SW780 cells were cultured in IMDM. All media was prepared with 10% heat inactivated FBS and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin. All cell lines were maintained at 37Â°C	 5% CO2.  Site-directed mutagenesis	 cloning	 and TREX cell line generation  All MTOR and RHEB point mutations were generated in the parental vectors using site-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange II XL kit according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. Primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 5. Point mutations were verified using Sanger sequencing as conducted by Eton Biosciences. The HA-GST-4EBP1 reporter vector was generated by synthesizing a gBlock from IDT encoding for 4EBP1 and cloning it into the pRK5-HA-GST vector using SalI and NotI restriction digestion followed by ligation. WT and mutant mTOR cDNAs were subcloned directly from the pcDNA3 vector into the pcDNA5/FRT/TO vector using single site NotI restriction digestion followed by ligation. Flag-mTOR-expressing TREX cells were generated according to the manufacturer's protocol.  Cell treatments	 lysis	 and immunoprecipitations  For S6K1 and Akt1 co-transfection assays	 3Ã—105 HEK-293T or HEK-293E cells per well were seeded into 6-well tissue culture plates	 transfected 24 hours later with 2 Î¼g of mTOR-encoding plasmid and 1 ng of S6K1- or Akt1-encoding plasmid using X-tremeGENE 9 or FuGENE HD	 followed by whole cell lysis 48 hours after transfection in NP-40 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.5	 150 mM NaCl	 1% NP-40 substitute	 1 mM EDTA at pH8.0	 50 mM NaF	 10 mM Na-pyrophosphate	 15 mM Na3VO4	 100 mM Î²-glycerophosphate	 and 1 tablet of protease inhibitor per 50 mL of buffer). 200-400 Î¼g of whole cell lysates were mixed with 5x SDS-sample buffer to a final concentration of 1-2 Î¼g/Î¼L	 boiled for 5 minutes	 and then used directly for immunoblotting or frozen at âˆ’20Â°C. For glutathione pull down assays	 2Ã—106 HEK-293T cells were seeded onto 10 cm tissue culture plates	 transfected 24 hours later with 10 Î¼g of mTOR-encoding plasmid and 2 ng of S6K1-encoding plasmid using X-tremeGENE 9	 and lysed 48-72 hours after transfection in NP-40 lysis buffer. 2-3 mg of the resultant whole-cell lysates were incubated with 30 Î¼L of pre-washed glutathione-coupled agarose beads in a 1 mL volume	 which were rotated at 4Â°C for two hours	 spun at 2	500 RCF for one minute	 washed in 500 Î¼L lysis buffer three times	 and the beads directly boiled in 50 Î¼L of 2x SDS-sample buffer. For mTOR immunoprecipitations	 the cells were treated as with the glutathione pulldown	 except they were lysed/washed in CHAPS buffer (50 mM HEPES at pH 7.4	 150 mM NaCl	 0.4% CHAPS	 50 mM NaF	 10 mM Na-pyrophosphate	 100 mM Î²-glycerophosphate	 and 1 tablet of protease inhibitor per 50 mL of buffer) and incubated with Flag-M2-coupled agarose beads.  Immunoblotting  10-50 Î¼g of whole cell lysates	 10-30 Î¼L of glutathione pulldown samples	 or 10-30 Î¼L of Flag-M2 immunoprecipitates were loaded into lanes of 4-12% bis-tris SDS-PAGE gels	 run at 120 volts for 2 hours in 1x MOPS buffer	 and then transferred to 0.45 Î¼m PVDF membrane at 60 volts for 2 hours in 1x transfer buffer (100 mM CAPS	 123 mM NaOH	 10% Ethanol). The membranes were then immunoblotted for the indicated proteins. All primary antibodies were diluted 1:1000 in 5% BSA W/V TBST	 with the exception of GAPDH and Flag antibodies which were diluted 1:2000. All secondary antibodies were diluted 1:5000 in 5% milk W/V TBST. Densitometry was performed using ImageJ and a student's T test was used to determine statistical significance.  Rapamycin	 Torin1	 MLN0128	 GDC0980	 and nutrient starvation/re-stimulation treatments  For the mTOR inhibitor experiments	 3Ã—105 TREX cells per well were seeded into 6-well plates	 grown for one day	 treated with 100 nM rapamycin	 250 nM Torin1	 250 nM MLN0128	 250 nM GDC0980	 or DMSO for 60 minutes. The cells were then lysed as above. For the nutrient deprivation experiments	 3Ã—105 TREX cells per well were seeded into 6-well plates	 grown for one day	 rinsed briefly in 1x amino acid- or glucose-free RPMI	 incubated in 1x amino acid- or glucose-free RPMI for 60 minutes	 and then stimulated with free amino acids or glucose to the levels in complete RPMI for 15 minutes.  In vitro proliferation assays  Six replicates each of 800-1200 cells were seeded into 96-well plates	 treated with 8 doses of rapamycin 24 hours later	 and assayed for ATP content using Cell Titer Glo 96 hours following rapamycin treatment according to the manufacturer's protocol.  In vivo xenograft assays  3Ã—106 cells per injection site were implanted subcutaneously into the right and left flanks of nude mice. Once tumors were palpable in all animals (>50 mm3 volume by caliper measurements)	 mice were assigned randomly into rapamycin treated or untreated groups and caliper measurements were taken every 3-4 days until tumor burden approached the limits set by institutional guidelines. Tumor volume was assessed according to the formula (0.5)(W)(W)(L)	 and a student's T test was used to determine the p-values. Rapamycin (4 mg/kg) or vehicle was delivered by daily IP injection	 100 mL per injection. All experiments involving mice were carried out with approval from the Committee for Animal Care at MIT and under supervision of the Department of Comparative Medicine at MIT.   Significance  We report that a diverse set of cancer-associated MTOR mutations confer increased mTORC1/2 pathway activity and that cells harboring these mutations are highly sensitive to rapamycin in culture and in vivo. These findings are clinically relevant as the MTOR mutations characterized herein may serve as biomarkers for predicting tumor responses to mTOR inhibitors.  Rheb	 an activator of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)	 displays low intrinsic GTPase activity favoring the biologically activated	 GTP-bound state. We identified a Rheb mutation (Y35A) that increases its intrinsic nucleotide hydrolysis activity âˆ¼10-fold	 and solved structures of both its active and inactive forms	 revealing an unexpected mechanism of GTP hydrolysis involving Asp65 in switch II and Thr38 in switch I. In the wild-type protein this noncanonical mechanism is markedly inhibited by Tyr35	 which constrains the active site conformation	 restricting the access of the catalytic Asp65 to the nucleotide-binding pocket. Rheb Y35A mimics the enthalpic and entropic changes associated with GTP hydrolysis elicited by the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) TSC2	 and is insensitive to further TSC2 stimulation. Overexpression of Rheb Y35A impaired the regulation of mTORC1 signaling by growth factor availability. We demonstrate that the opposing functions of Tyr35 in the intrinsic and GAP-stimulated GTP catalysis are critical for optimal mTORC1 regulation. ________________________________________ Graphical Abstract   Figure options Highlights â–º Tyr35 autoinhibits intrinsic GTPase activity of Rheb and maintains activation â–º Rheb Y35A efficiently hydrolyzes GTP using Asp65 rather than Gln64 â–º Tyr35 and Asp65 are indispensable for sensitivity of Rheb to TSC2GAP function â–º Regulation of mTORC1 by growth factors depends on Rheb Tyr35 and Asp65 ________________________________________ Introduction Small GTPases act as molecular switches to regulate diverse cellular functions. When bound to guanosine triphosphate (GTP)	 they adopt an â€œonâ€ conformation that elicits a biological response. GTP hydrolysis is accompanied by a conformational change into a GDP-bound â€œoffâ€ conformation. Cycling between the active and inactive states of each GTPase is a result of the intrinsic nucleotide hydrolysis and exchange rates	 and regulatory proteins that catalyze these processes. GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) stimulate GTP hydrolysis	 whereas guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) mediate the displacement of GDP	 allowing a new GTP molecule to bind (Bos et al.	 2007). GTPase proteins possess either complete or partial catalytic machinery for hydrolysis of GTP. In most cases an electronegative group is used for stabilization/polarization of the hydrolytic water for in-line nucleophilic attack of the Î³-phosphate (Li and Zhang	 2004; Maegley et al.	 1996). In most Ras and Rho subfamily GTPases	 this is achieved by the carboxamide oxygen of a conserved Gln in a dynamic loop called switch II. Ras and Rho GAPs work by stabilizing this Gln in a catalytic conformation	 whereas an Arg residue referred to as an â€œArginine fingerâ€ neutralizes the developing negative charge on the Î±- and Î²-phosphates of GTP (Scheffzek et al.	 1997). In other systems	 such as Rap-RapGAP	 a catalytic asparagine is provided in trans by the GAP ( Scrima et al.	 2008). Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb) is a key regulator of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway (Dunlop et al.	 2009; Inoki et al.	 2003). Rheb-GTP promotes phosphorylation of mTORC1 targets	 resulting in enhanced protein translation and cellular growth (Garami et al.	 2003). Rheb has an unusually slow intrinsic GTPase activity	 which is regulated by the GAP activity of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2)	 a tumor suppressor frequently inactivated in human patients with the tumor predisposition syndrome tuberous sclerosis (Garami et al.	 2003; Tee et al.	 2003). Rheb overexpression has been observed in certain cancer cell lines (Eom et al.	 2008; Im et al.	 2002; Nardella et al.	 2008)	 and constitutively activated Rheb mutants can induce oncogenic transformation in cell culture (Jiang and Vogt	 2008). The low intrinsic GTPase activity of Rheb has been attributed to the catalytically incompetent conformation of Gln64 (Yu et al.	 2005)	 which is homologous to Ras Gln61	 but does not participate in GTP hydrolysis (Li et al.	 2004; Marshall et al.	 2009). TSC2GAP is thought to utilize Asn1643 to promote GTP hydrolysis by substituting for Gln64 in an â€œAsn thumbâ€-type mechanism (Inoki et al.	 2003; Marshall et al.	 2009) similar to that of RapGAP (Scrima et al.	 2008). Here	 utilizing site-directed mutagenesis	 crystallography	 and real-time NMR-based GTPase assays	 we discovered that Rheb Tyr35	 a residue that is highly conserved across the small GTPase superfamily (Wennerberg et al.	 2005)	 maintains the high activation state of Rheb by inhibiting intrinsic GTP hydrolysis. Mutation of this residue substantially accelerated intrinsic nucleotide hydrolysis through a catalytic mechanism that did not require Gln64 but also conferred resistance to the activity of TSC2. Crystal structures of Rheb Y35A led us to identify the backbone carbonyl of Thr38 and side chain of Asp65 as candidate residues that contribute to the intrinsic GTPase activity. Mutagenesis studies confirm that Asp65 contributes significantly to the intrinsic GTPase activity of both wild-type (WT) Rheb and the Y35A mutant. Furthermore	 Asp65 was absolutely essential for the sensitivity of Rheb to the GAP activity of TSC2	 whereas Gln64 was dispensable. Consistent with the in vitro data	 expression of Rheb Y35A and D65A mutants in mammalian cells affected transduction of growth factor signals to mTORC1. Taken together	 our observations reveal an efficient noncanonical mechanism of GTP hydrolysis by Rheb and suggest that autoinhibition of catalysis maintains Rheb in its highly activated state upon growth factor stimulation	 which is necessary for the proper signal transduction to mTORC1. Results Rheb Y35 Inhibits Intrinsic GTPase Activity We previously showed that fluorescent-tagged nucleotides can alter the hydrolysis and exchange rates governing the GTPase cycle (Mazhab-Jafari et al.	 2010). The most striking example we observed was that 2â€²-/3â€²-O-(Nâ€²-Methylanthraniloyl) (mant)GTP was hydrolyzed by Rheb âˆ¼10-fold faster than GTP. This is not an intrinsic property of the modified nucleotide because the mant moiety inhibited GTP hydrolysis by RhoA and did not affect hydrolysis by Ras. The rate of mantGTP hydrolysis by Rheb is similar to that of Ras (Figure 1A)	 indicating that Rheb has a latent capacity for efficient catalysis. Interestingly	 however	 the rapid hydrolysis of mantGTP was independent of Rheb Gln64 (Mazhab-Jafari et al.	 2010). The position of the fluorophore in a structure of Ras bound to a nonhydrolyzable analog of mantGTP (Scheidig et al.	 1995) suggested that it may interact with the phenol ring of Tyr35 in switch I of Rheb. Remarkably	 mutation of Tyr35 to Ala recapitulated the mant effect	 increasing the rate of GTP hydrolysis by an order of magnitude (Figure 1B). Furthermore	 the mant tag had no further effect on the catalytic activity of Rheb Y35A	 suggesting that the mutation and the fluorophore stimulate hydrolysis through the same mechanism (Figure 1B). These observations indicate that Tyr35 autoinhibits the intrinsic GTPase activity of Rheb.   Figure 1.  Rapid Hydrolysis of mantGTP by Rheb Is Related to Autoinhibitory Role of Tyr35 (A) Hydrolysis of GTP or mantGTP by Rheb (black and green	 respectively) and Ras (red and blue	 respectively) is shown. Reaction rates derived by curve fitting are presented in the insets. (B) Hydrolysis of GTP by WT Rheb (black)	 and GTP and mantGTP by Rheb Y35A (green and red	 respectively) is presented. Error bars associated with data points in the curves represent SD of the fraction GDP reported by several residues.

Figure options Structural Basis for the Tyr35 Autoinhibitory Function We crystallized GDP-bound Rheb Y35A in the presence of excess GMPPNP (a nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP)	 and to our surprise	 the asymmetric unit contained two molecules of Rheb: one bound to GDP and one to GMPPNP (Figures 2Aâ€“2C; Table 1). The overall protein fold is very similar to WT Rheb (Yu et al.	 2005) (backbone rmsd of 0.44 Ã…) with a few key differences. The nucleotide-binding pocket is completely solvent exposed in the GMPPNP-bound structure of Rheb Y35A	 whereas in the WT protein the triphosphate group of the nucleotide is shielded from the solvent by the phenol ring of Tyr35	 which forms a hydrogen bond with the Î³-phosphate. In addition the Î³-phosphate is 0.5 Ã… closer to Thr38 in the absence of Tyr35 (Figure 2D)	 which in the WT structure â€œpullsâ€ the Î³-phosphate toward the middle of switch I. Interestingly	 the hydrolytic water is closer to the backbone carbonyl of Thr38 in the mutant (2.7 versus 3.8 Ã… in the WT protein) (Figure 2D)	 placing it in a more electron-rich environment that may enhance its polarization for an in-line nucleophilic attack to the Î³-phosphate. It has been proposed that the corresponding backbone carbonyl of Ras (Thr35) contributes to the stabilization/activation of the catalytic water during intrinsic GTP hydrolysis (Buhrman et al.	 2010; Frech et al.	 1994). Comparison of our structure with that of WT Rheb indicates that Tyr35 pulls the Î³-phosphate and catalytic water away from the Thr38 carbonyl	 thus reducing its catalytic contribution.   Figure 2.  Structure and Dynamics of Rheb Y35A (A) Asymmetric unit and electron density of nucleotide substrates are demonstrated. The asymmetric unit of the Rheb Y35A crystal containing one GDP-bound (cyan) and one GMPPNP-bound (green) Rheb molecule is shown in the center. 2Fo-Fc electron density maps at 1.5Ïƒ of the nucleotide-binding site with GMPPNP (left) fitted into one Rheb Y35A molecule and GDP (right) in the second molecule of the crystal asymmetric unit is illustrated.

Table options Switch I of Rheb Y35A does not undergo any substantial conformational change upon nucleotide hydrolysis"	 whereas this region of the WT protein exhibits a large structural change mediated by an interaction between Tyr35 and the Î³-phosphate (Yu et al.	 2005) (Figures 2E and 2F). It was hypothesized that a similar nucleotide-dependent rearrangement of Rap Tyr32 would be energetically unfavorable to the GTPase reaction (Cherfils et al.	 1997)	 consistent with our observation that nucleotide hydrolysis is accelerated by a mutation that disrupts this conformational change. Identification of a Catalytic Residue for GTP Hydrolysis Previous work has shown that Gln64	 corresponding to the catalytic Gln61 of Ras	 is not involved in GTP hydrolysis by WT Rheb (Inoki et al.	 2003; Li et al.	 2004; Marshall et al.	 2009). Likewise	 Gln64 remains in a noncatalytic conformation in the structure of Rheb Y35A (see Figure S1A available online) and is not required for the accelerated hydrolysis of GTP by Rheb Y35A (Figures S1D and S2A). Because the catalytic residues of other small GTPase superfamily members are found in the N terminus of switch II	 we examined this region for residues with electronegative side chains that may contribute to the hydrolytic reaction. Immediately downstream of Gln64 are two residues with acidic side chains: Asp65 and Glu66 (Figure 2G). The crystal structure of Rheb Y35A shows that the backbone of the N-terminal loop of switch II of this mutant is displaced by an average of 1 Ã… toward the nucleotide-binding pocket relative to the WT	 which brings the side-chain carboxylate of Asp65 closer to the nucleotide by 1 Ã…: average Asp65OÎ´1	2WT âˆ’ average Asp65OÎ´1	2Y35A (Figure 2G). Mutation of Asp65 to Ala reduced the intrinsic hydrolysis of Rheb Y35A by more than 60% and that of WT by 30% (Figure 3A)	 as did the conservative substitution of Asp65 by Asn (Figure S2B). On the other hand	 mutations of Glu66 had no effect on intrinsic GTPase activity (Figure S2C)	 consistent with its perpendicular orientation away from the nucleotide (Figure 2G). We also tested all other residues found within 10 Ã… of the hydrolytic water in the Rheb Y35A structure that could potentially provide (1) a negative charge to activate this water molecule	 or (2) a positive charge to stabilize the Î²- and Î³-phosphates in the transition state for hydrolysis (Figure S1). There was no change in the rate of intrinsic nucleotide hydrolysis associated with R15G	 S16A	 or D36A mutations (Figures S1B	 S1C	 and S1E). The only other charged residues within 10 Ã… of the hydrolytic water are Lys19 and Asp60 of the highly conserved G1 and G3 box motifs	 respectively. The Rheb K19A mutant failed to express	 presumably due to impaired nucleotide binding	 and D60A was highly unstable and could not be loaded with GTP	 consistent with the role of this residue in Mg2+ coordination (Yu et al.	 2005). These data strongly suggest that Asp65 is the sole candidate for a catalytic residue in Rheb. Notably	 carboxylates are more potent nucleophiles than carboxamides	 and consistently	 the Q61E substitution increased the GTPase activity of Ras (Frech et al.	 1994).   Figure 3.  Role of Asp65 in Intrinsic and GAP-Mediated GTP Hydrolysis by Rheb (A) Hydrolysis of GTP by WT Rheb (black)	 the mutants D65A and Y35A (blue and green	 respectively)	 as well as the double-mutant Y35A-D65A (red) is illustrated. Reaction rates derived by curve fitting are presented in the insets. (B) Sensitivity of WT Rheb and Asp65 mutants to TSC2GAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis is shown. WT	 WT+GAP	 D65A+GAP	 D65E+GAP	 and D65N+GAP are shown with black	 blue	 green	 yellow	 and red	 respectively. Error bars associated with data points in the curves represent SD of the fraction GDP reported by several residues. Error bars in the histograms represent the uncertainty associated with rates derived from curve fitting. See also Figures S1	 S2	 and S5. Figure options In the structure of WT Rheb	 the carboxylate of Asp65 is 12 Ã… (average Asp65OÎ´1	2) from the Î³-phosphate in a single conformation	 whereas the electron density of Rheb Y35A indicates that Asp65 exists in two conformations	 11.0 and 12.0 Ã… from the Î³-phosphate	 respectively (Figure S1F). By comparison the catalytic carboxamide of Ras (Gln61OÎµ) has been found at distances varying from 4.7 to 12.2 Ã… from the Î³-phosphate (median distance of 8.1Ã…) (Figure S3A) in available crystallographic snapshots	 consistent with the dynamic nature of switch II determined by NMR studies (Ito et al.	 1997). Thus	 despite its established role as a catalytic residue (Frech et al.	 1994)	 Gln61 is rarely found in a catalytically competent conformation in Ras crystal structures	 presumably because this state is transient and energetically unfavorable (Fraser et al.	 2011; Grant et al.	 2009). Similarly	 our Y35A structure and the previous WT Rheb structure (Yu et al.	 2005) both appear to be energetically stable states	 with the conformations of Asp65 stabilized primarily by ionic and polar interactions with the Arg15 and Ser68 side chains	 which are also found in two alternate conformations in our structure (Figure S1F). Interestingly	 comparison of WT and Y35A 1H-15N heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra revealed increased line broadening for residues in the P loop and the N terminus of switch II of GTP-bound Rheb Y35A (Figures 2H and S4A)	 suggesting elevated dynamics in Î¼s-ms timescale. This could allow the N terminus of switch II to sample alternate conformations closer to the nucleotide and the catalytic water. The elevated dynamics of the N-terminal region of switch II and its proximity to the nucleotide-binding site in Rheb Y35A is consistent with the greater impact on catalysis of Asp65 mutations in the Y35A mutant than in WT Rheb (Figure 3A). Hence	 in addition to affecting the orientation of the nucleotide and hydrolytic water	 Tyr35 may reduce the intrinsic GTPase activity of Rheb by restricting the dynamics of switch II and displacing it from the nucleotide-binding site. Relative to Ras	 the catalytic Gln residues of Rho subfamily GTPases were found closer to the Î³-phosphate (median distance of 5.5Ã…) (Figures S3A and S3C)	 which may contribute to their faster intrinsic nucleotide hydrolysis rate (Mazhab-Jafari et al.	 2010). On the other hand	 Gln63	 which was recently proposed to be a noncanonical catalytic residue of Rap in GAP1IP4BP-mediated GTP hydrolysis (Sot et al.	 2010)	 is found with a median distance of 11.8 Ã… from the Î³-phosphate in structures of free Rap (Figure S3A)	 consistent with the slow nucleotide hydrolysis of this GTPase. In Ras	 Gly12	 Gly13	 and Gln61 are the major sites of oncogenic mutations. Mutation of Ras Gly12 to any other residue hinders GTP hydrolysis by sterically occluding access of the catalytic residue Gln61 to the hydrolytic water and nucleotide (Krengel et al.	 1990). However	 Rheb has an Arg in this position	 and its mutation to Gly (R15G) does not increase the catalytic activity of Rheb Y35A (Figure S1E) or WT (Im et al.	 2002; Li et al.	 2004; Marshall et al.	 2009; Yamagata et al.	 1994). The distinctive impact of P loop residues on the activities of Ras and Rheb lends further support to the different molecular mechanisms of action of these two closely related GTPase homologs. Involvement of Rheb's Asp65 and Tyr35 in TSC2GAP-Mediated GTP Hydrolysis Mutation of the solvent-exposed residue Asp65 to Ala (D65A) did not perturb the structure of Rheb	 on the basis of minimal and localized chemical shift perturbations in the 1H-15N HSQC spectra that were mainly confined to switch II (Figure S5)	 but totally abolished the susceptibility of Rheb to the GAP activity of TSC2 (Figure 3B). Furthermore	 even conservative mutations of Asp65 (D65E/N) rendered Rheb totally insensitive to the activity of TSC2GAP. The strict requirement for the geometry and charge of this side chain suggest that it might be a critical catalytic residue for the GAP-mediated hydrolysis reaction. We also tested the sensitivity of the GTPase activity of Rheb Y35A to the action of TSC2GAP and found that the GTPase activity of this mutant was not further stimulated by the addition of the GAP domain of TSC2 (Figure 4A). An analogous mutation (Y32A) impaired the sensitivity of Rap GTPase to the function of RapGAP (Brinkmann et al.	 2002; Scrima et al.	 2008); however	 a conservative mutation (Y32F) was tolerated. Interestingly	 the Y35F mutation was sufficient to render Rheb insensitive to the function of the TSC2GAP (Figure 4B)	 highlighting differences in the details of molecular recognition in these two homologous systems.   Figure 4.  Tyr35 Hydroxyl Is Required for TSC2GAP-Assisted GTP Hydrolysis (A) Intrinsic and GAP-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis by Rheb Y35A is presented. (B) Intrinsic and GAP-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis by Rheb Y35F is demonstrated. In both graphs the GTPase activities of mutant Rheb with and without TSC2GAP are shown in black and green	 respectively	 and the TSC2GAP-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis by WT Rheb is shown in blue. Error bars associated with data points in the curves represent SD of the fraction GDP reported by several residues. Error bars in the histograms represent the uncertainty associated with rates derived from curve fitting. See also Figure S4. Figure options Thermodynamic Basis for the Tyr35 Autoinhibitory Function To better understand the energetic basis of Tyr35 autoinhibition	 we analyzed the thermodynamics of the GTP hydrolysis reaction using an Arrhenius plot (Figure S6). This powerful technique allows one to extract energetic parameters	 such as enthalpy	 entropy	 and free energy	 from the highly unstable and low-populated transition state of an enzymatic reaction. The increased catalytic activity of Rheb Y35A was associated with a large reduction in the activation enthalpy for GTP hydrolysis (Figure S6; Table 2). However	 the activation entropy was also reduced (unfavorable contribution)	 resulting in a modest decrease in the overall activation free energy of the nucleotide hydrolysis reaction in the mutant. Because there is a buildup of negative charge on the Î²-Î³-bridging oxygen during GTP hydrolysis (Allin et al.	 2001; Cepus et al.	 1998; Du et al.	 2000)	 the proximity of the electron-rich phenol ring of Rheb Tyr35 could destabilize the transition state	 which is consistent with the reduction in activation enthalpy associated with mutation of this residue. Interestingly	 the Arg fingers of Ras- and Rho-GAPs accelerate nucleotide hydrolysis of their cognate GTPases by providing positive charge in a position equivalent to that of Rheb Tyr35. Another contribution to the enthalpic term may come from the strengthened hydrogen bond between the Thr38 carbonyl in the mutant and the repositioned catalytic water	 which may be more reactive toward the Î³-phosphate (Frech et al.	" 1994). Table 2.

T is set to 298 K in the equation Î”Gâ€¡ = Î”Hâ€¡ âˆ’ T Î”Sâ€¡. See also Figure S6. a Values from Marshall et al. (2009). Table options The larger negative value of Î”Sâ€¡ for Rheb Y35A indicates that formation of the transition state requires the mutant to undergo a larger increase in â€œorderâ€ than the WT protein. In the crystal structure of WT Rheb-GMPPNP	 a hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl of Tyr35 and the Î³-phosphate of GMPPNP stabilizes switch I	 contributing to the order of the ground state. Disruption of this contact by mutation of Tyr35 increases the disorder in switch I	 as illustrated by partial spectral broadening of peaks from residues 27â€“30 of GTP-bound Rheb Y35A (Figure S4). Thus	 assembly of the ordered transition state from the more flexible Rheb Y35A ground state would be more entropically unfavorable. The conservative mutation Y35F increased intrinsic hydrolysis almost as much as Y35A with similar thermodynamic effects (Figure S6; Table 2)	 suggesting that the H bond between the hydroxyl of Tyr35 and the Î³-phosphate is critical for the autoinhibition of Rheb's GTPase activity. It is very interesting to note that the thermodynamic landscape of intrinsic GTP hydrolysis in the Y35A mutant (reduced activation enthalpy with an entropic penalty) is similar to that reported for TSC2GAP-mediated GTP hydrolysis in WT Rheb (Marshall et al.	 2009)	 suggesting that TSC2GAP may promote hydrolysis in part by disrupting the electrostatic contact between Tyr35 and the Î³-phosphate. Consistent with this hypothesis	 the increased rate of GTP hydrolysis by the Rheb Y35A/Y35F mutants is not further accelerated by the addition of the GAP (Figure 4). The larger reduction of the activation enthalpy by TSC2GAP-mediated catalysis compared to Y35A mutation suggests that the GAP provides additional stimulatory electrostatic contributions to GTP hydrolysis	 perhaps via complementation of the intrinsic catalytic machinery by the Asn thumb. On the other hand the larger unfavorable reduction in entropy of the GAP-mediated reaction could be due to complex formation between Rheb and the GAP domain of TSC2. Mutation of Asp65 substantially impairs the stimulatory effect of the Y35A mutation on intrinsic hydrolysis; hence	 we measured the thermodynamic parameters of the transition state for the Rheb double-mutant Y35A-D65A (Table 2). Mutation of Asp65 increased the activation enthalpy (Î”Hâ€¡) of Rheb Y35A	 indicating that the negatively charged carboxylic acid side chain of Asp65 stabilizes the transition state because the enthalpic term originates primarily from electrostatic interactions (KÃ¶tting and Gerwert	 2004). In Ras the enthalpic contribution to hydrolysis was attributed to the charge shift from the Î³- toward the Î²-phosphate (KÃ¶tting and Gerwert	 2004). We propose that electrostatic interactions between Rheb Asp65 and the nucleotide similarly shift charge in the transition state to promote hydrolysis. Interestingly	 Tyr35 reduces the enthalpic contribution of Asp65 to GTP hydrolysis	 Î”Î”Hâ€¡(Y35A-Y35A	D65A) > Î”Î”Hâ€¡(WT-D65A) (Table 2)	 which is consistent with our kinetic data (Figure 3A). Regulation of mTORC1 by Growth Factors Involves the Noncanonical Catalytic and Autoinhibitory Mechanisms To investigate the role of Rheb's catalytic machinery	 and its autoinhibition	 in the activation of mTORC1	 HeLa cells were transfected with WT Rheb or the Y35A or D65A mutants. Phosphorylation of p70 S6K Thr389	 a measure of mTORC1 signaling throughput (Figure 5A)	 was monitored by immunoblotting	 upon growth factor starvation	 as well as 15 min and 6 hr after growth factor stimulation (Figures 5B and S7). Following growth factor stimulation	 when the TSC1/TSC2 complex is downregulated (Benvenuto et al.	 2000; Chong-Kopera et al.	 2006)	 mutation of Rheb Tyr35 to Ala reduced the activation of mTORC1	 as evidenced by slightly lower p70 S6K phosphorylation despite higher Rheb Y35A expression compared to Rheb WT	 an effect made more apparent with longer stimulation (Figures 5B and S7). Remarkably	 in the absence of stimuli upon serum starvation	 Rheb Y35A led to a significant increase in mTORC1 activity	 as did the expression of the GAP-resistant mutant Rheb D65A (Figure 5B). Mutation of Asp65 (but not Tyr35) perturbed the chemical shift of the neighboring switch II residue Tyr67 (Figures S4A and S5)	 previously shown to be critical for activation of mTORC1 (Long et al.	 2007)	 which may affect the ability of Rheb D65A to fully activate mTORC1. This may explain the fact that under conditions of growth factor stimulation	 Rheb D65A induced less S6K phosphorylation than the WT protein	 despite its reduced intrinsic GTPase activity (Figure 5B).   Figure 5.

The background intensity was used as estimation for the error in the intensity measurements and propagated appropriately throughout division. More details are described in Experimental Procedures. Representative western blots are shown in Figure S7. (C) Rheb nucleotide loading monitored in HEK293 cells with 32P-labeling experiment as described in Experimental Procedures is presented. See also Figure S7. Figure options Guanine nucleotide loading of WT Rheb and the mutants in vivo was determined by their immunoprecipitation from HEK293 cells metabolically labeled with 32P-orthophosphate and nucleotide resolution by thin-layer chromatography (Figure 5C). Consistent with its increased GTPase activity	 Rheb Y35A displayed reduced loading of GTP	 whereas Rheb D65A showed modestly increased GTP loading. Reflected in the elevated loading of WT Rheb with GTP (Figure 5C)	 the overabundance of transfected Rheb proteins likely negates the effects of endogenous TSC2 on the overexpressed Rheb mutants in this cell line. Although the lower GTP loading of Rheb Y35A indicates higher intrinsic hydrolysis rate than that of the WT protein	 modestly increased GTP loading of D65A signifies the autoinhibitory effects of Tyr35 on Asp65's contribution to intrinsic catalysis	 consistent with their in vitro behavior (Figure 3A). Discussion GTPases are versatile molecular switches that utilize surprisingly diverse mechanisms to mediate the interconversion between the active and inactive states. The study presented here illustrates how Rheb evolved a GTP hydrolysis mechanism drastically different from its close homolog H-Ras. Rheb employs an autoinhibitory mechanism to maintain a high activation state in cells essential for the proper maintenance of mTORC1 signaling and cellular growth. The autoinhibitory mechanism functions via an interaction between Rheb Tyr35-OH and the Î³-phosphate of GTP	 which hinders GTP hydrolysis. Interestingly	 our investigation of this inhibitory mechanism led to the elucidation of an unusual Rheb catalytic mechanism involving Asp65	 which is one position downstream of the canonical catalytic Gln	 equivalent to Ras Gln61 and Rho Gln63. In the canonical mechanism the catalytic water is activated/stabilized by interaction with an electronegative group	 the carboxamide oxygen of a glutamine	 provided either in cis or trans ( Bos et al.	 2007). Although an equivalent residue (Gln64) is present in the sequence of Rheb switch II	 our work demonstrates that the catalytic function is carried out by the adjacent Asp65. A Tyr residue in switch I is highly conserved among the GTPase superfamily; however	 the functional role of this residue varies. For example in RhoA	 Tyr34 stimulates intrinsic hydrolysis	 presumably by stabilizing the catalytic conformation of Gln63 in switch II	 whereas Ras Tyr32 is solvent exposed and does not impact the intrinsic hydrolysis (Figure S3). In Rheb	 Tyr35 counters the contribution of Asp65 to catalysis by restricting the dynamics of switch II and reducing its access to the catalytic site (Figure 6). Severe peak broadening was observed for the amides of Gly63	 Gln64	 Asp65	 and Glu66 in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the Y35A mutant (Figure 2H)	 presumably the result of disrupting the H bond network from Tyr35 to the amide of Gly63 through the catalytic water and the Î³-phosphate (Figure 2D). Moreover	 Tyr35 restricts the position of the hydrolytic water and reduces its polarization by the carbonyl of Thr38	 which is thought to promote hydrolysis (Buhrman et al.	 2010; Frech et al.	 1994). The residual catalytic activity found in Rheb D65A may reflect the stimulatory effect of the Thr38 backbone carbonyl in polarization and/or stabilization of the hydrolytic water. Upon mutation of Tyr35	 Asp65 adopts two conformations	 one of which is more proximal (relative to the WT) to the nucleotide-binding site and appears better positioned for hydrolysis (Figure 2G)	 consistent with our finding that mutation of Asp65 has a greater impact on the catalytic activity of Rheb Y35A than that of WT (Figure 3A). On the basis of the multiple crystallographic conformations of Asp65	 and the NMR peak broadening	 we propose that in both WT and Y35A Rheb	 switch II exists in an ensemble of conformations	 some of which allow Asp65 to adopt a catalytic conformation closer to the nucleotide.   Figure 6.  Schematic Model of Intrinsic and TSC2GAP-Stimulated GTP Hydrolysis by Rheb (A) In WT Rheb	 Tyr35 displaces the hydrolytic water away from the backbone carbonyl of Thr38	 reducing the polarization and reactivity of this water molecule. Furthermore	 Tyr35 reduces the electrostatic contribution of Asp65 to the GTP hydrolysis reaction by displacing this residue away from the nucleotide and the catalytic water. (B) Mutation of Tyr35 allows Asp65 and Thr38 to assemble a more efficient catalytic site. (C) Interaction of the GAP domain of TSC2 with Rheb may reduce the inhibitory effects of Tyr35	 allowing Asp65 to promote catalysis in synergy with the Asn thumb (Asn1643) provided in trans by TSC2GAP. See also Figure S6. Figure options Structural evidence implicating Asp as a catalytic residue exists for at least one other member of the GTPase superfamily	 the signal recognition particle (SRP) Ffh/FtsY (Focia et al.	 2004)	 which is a large dimeric prokaryotic GTPase that is highly divergent from the Ras family. Nevertheless	 to our knowledge	 a catalytic Asp has not been previously reported within the Ras subfamily. On the other hand the inhibitory role for a switch I Tyr we discovered in Rheb may be relevant in inhibiting the intrinsic hydrolytic machinery in certain other GTPases	 such as Ran (Brucker et al.	 2010). Our structural analysis of Rheb also shed further light on the mechanism of TSC2GAP-mediated hydrolysis of GTP. We propose that whereas providing an Asn thumb as a means of accelerating catalysis	 TSC2GAP may also stimulate the GTPase activity of Rheb by relieving autoinhibition and aligning Rheb's catalytic machinery (Figure 6C). Interaction of TSC2 with Rheb switch I may disrupt the electrostatic contact between Tyr35 and the Î³-phosphate	 reducing the autoinhibitory effect of this residue on GTP hydrolysis	 explaining the functional and thermodynamic similarities between WT Rheb in the presence of the TSC2GAP and the Rheb Y35A mutant alone. A common theme in GAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis is repositioning of the N terminus of switch II relative to the nucleotide-binding site to allow for efficient catalysis. For example the RanGAP Asn thumb serves to properly orient the catalytic Gln69 of Ran (Bos et al.	 2007; Seewald et al.	 2002). Similarly	 GAPIP4BP has been proposed to promote Rap GTP hydrolysis by repositioning a noncanonical catalytic glutamine residue	 Gln63	 located two positions C terminal to the position corresponding to Ras Gln61 (Sot et al.	 2010). In the case of Rheb	 we propose that Rheb-TSC2GAP interaction stabilizes Asp65 closer to the Î³-phosphate to catalyze GTP hydrolysis in synergy with the Asn thumb (Asn1643) provided by TSC2GAP. The delineation of the precise details of TSC2-mediated catalysis will require a more detailed structural analysis of the Rheb:TSC2GAP complex that is hindered by the transient nature of their interaction observed by us and others (Marshall et al.	 2009; Scrima et al.	 2008)	 preventing us from distinguishing impaired binding from impaired catalysis. The Tyr35-mediated autoinhibition of Rheb's GTPase reaction is necessary to maintain the appropriate level of activation of this small GTPase	 and thus mTORC1 signaling	 in response to growth factors. When growth factors are available	 TSC2GAP activity becomes limiting	 and Tyr35 inhibits GTP hydrolysis	 resulting in mTORC1 upregulation. In the absence of stimulation	 Rheb Tyr35 is required for productive TSC2GAP-mediated acceleration of GTP hydrolysis to shut down mTORC1 signaling. Indeed	 overexpression of Rheb Y35A substantially uncouples mTOR signaling from growth factors. In cells overexpressing WT Rheb	 mTOR signaling was strongly responsive to the availability of serum and insulin	 whereas this response was significantly dampened in cells overexpressing the Y35A mutant. To our knowledge	 this is the first example of a distinct mechanism of intrinsic nucleotide hydrolysis within the Ras subfamily	 which may be relevant to some other Ras superfamily GTPases	 particularly those that lack the canonical catalytic Gln in switch II (e.g.	 Rap GTPases). This study provides a view into an unusual mechanism of GTP hydrolysis by Rheb and an intriguing autoinhibitory interaction that blocks this GTPase reaction.    																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						
1	70||Assembly of H/ACA RNPs in yeast is aided by at least two accessory factors	 Naf1p and Shq1p. Although the function of Naf1p and its human ortholog NAF1 has been delineated in detail	 that of Shq1p and its putative human ortholog SHQ1 remains obscure. We demonstrate that SHQ1 indeed functions in the biogenesis of human H/ACA RNPs and we dissect its mechanism of action. Like NAF1	 SHQ1 binds the major H/ACA core protein and pseudouridine synthase NAP57 (aka dyskerin) but precedes the assembly role of NAF1 at nascent H/ACA RNAs because the interaction of SHQ1 with NAP57 in vivo and in vitro precludes that of NAF1 and of the other H/ACA core proteins that are present at the sites of H/ACA RNA transcription. The N-terminal heat shock protein 20-like CS domain of SHQ1 is dispensable for NAP57 binding. Consistent with its role as an assembly factor	 SHQ1 localizes to the nucleoplasm and is excluded from nucleoli and Cajal bodies	 the sites of mature H/ACA RNPs. In an in vitro assembly system of functional H/ACA RNPs that is dependent on NAF1	 excess recombinant SHQ1 interferes with assembly. Importantly	 knockdown of cellular SHQ1 prevents accumulation of a newly synthesized H/ACA reporter RNA and generally reduces the levels of endogenous H/ACA RNAs including telomerase RNA. In summary	 the sequential action of SHQ1 and NAF1 is required for functional assembly of H/ACA RNPs in vivo and in vitro. This step-wise process could serve as an efficient means of quality control during H/ACA RNP assembly.  Keywords: NAP57/dyskerin	 H/ACA RNP	 snoRNP	 RNP assembly	 telomerase Go to: INTRODUCTION In each mammalian cell	 150 or so H/ACA ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) function in diverse processes	 including modification and processing of ribosomal RNAs	 modification of spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs	 and stabilization of telomerase. Each particle consists of a function-defining H/ACA RNA and the same four core proteins. H/ACA RNPs are conserved from archaea to man and their structure and function have been delineated in genetic	 biochemical	 and X-ray crystallographic studies. The pseudouridine synthase NAP57 (aka dyskerin or in yeast Cbf5p) together with NOP10 and NHP2 forms a core trimer that specifically recognizes and associates with an H/ACA RNA and with the fourth core protein GAR1. All proteins of the core trimer are essential for the metabolic stability of H/ACA RNPs. Importantly	 NAP57 is the subject of the X-linked form of the bone marrow failure syndrome dyskeratosis congenita (for reviews	 see Meier 2005	 2008; Matera et al. 2007; Ye 2007; Kirwan and Dokal 2008; Li 2008).  These simple five component particles have proven surprisingly resistant to functional reconstitution. Although H/ACA RNPs can be formed from recombinant archaeal components	 eukaryotic ones have yet to yield (Baker et al. 2005; Charpentier et al. 2005). This may be ascribed to the inherent instability of NAP57 and to the need for at least two assembly factors	 Naf1p and Shq1p	 that seem missing from archaea (Wang and Meier 2004; Normand et al. 2006). These two essential factors were identified in yeast	 mainly by virtue of binding to Cbf5p (yeast NAP57)	 and are required for the stability of all H/ACA RNAs without being part of the mature particles (Dez et al. 2002; Fatica et al. 2002; Yang et al. 2002). Naf1p (NAF1 in mammals) has a GAR1 homology domain and consequently binds NAP57 (and the core trimer) at the same site as GAR1 (Fatica et al. 2002; Wang and Meier 2004; Leulliot et al. 2007). Together with the core trimer	 NAF1 associates with H/ACA RNAs at their site of transcription and is replaced by GAR1 in mature RNPs functioning in Cajal bodies and nucleoli (Ballarino et al. 2005; Yang et al. 2005; Darzacq et al. 2006; Hoareau-Aveilla et al. 2006). In contrast	 nothing is known about SHQ1 the putative mammalian ortholog of Shq1p.  Here	 we dissect in vitro and in vivo the interactions of SHQ1 with the H/ACA RNP proteins and show that it is required for the stable accumulation of H/ACA RNAs including telomerase RNA	 apparently acting before NAF1 in assembly. Our studies take advantage of a reconstitution assay that depends on both assembly factors for the generation of functional mammalian H/ACA RNPs.  Go to: RESULTS SHQ1 binds NAP57 alone  Shq1p was identified in yeast as a protein interacting with Cbf5p	 the ortholog of mammalian NAP57 (Ito et al. 2001; Ho et al. 2002). Indeed	 Shq1p proved essential for the quantitative accumulation of Cbf5p-associated H/ACA RNAs and was evolutionary conserved with putative homologs in man	 fly	 worm	 and fission yeast (Yang et al. 2002). In order to characterize the putative human SHQ1 (NM_018130; 26% identity and 47% similarity over the first 445 amino acids)	 we tested if it also interacted with H/ACA RNP associated factors.  Both	 human SHQ1 and NAP57 (as an N-terminal fusion with the maltose binding protein [MBP]) were expressed in bacteria with C-terminal histidine tags and affinity purified (Fig. 1A	 lanes 2	3). Equal amounts of recombinant SHQ1 were added to MBP-NAP57 and to a control MBP-fusion	 the MS2 bacteriophage coat protein (MCP). The mixtures were bound to amylose resin through the MBP moieties of the fusion proteins (Fig. 1A	 lanes 4â€“7). Only MBP-NAP57 retained SHQ1 (Fig. 1A	 lane 6)	 but not MBP-MCP (Fig. 1A	 lane 7)	 demonstrating a direct interaction between SHQ1 and NAP57.  FIGURE 1. FIGURE 1. In vitro	 SHQ1 only binds NAP57	 to the exclusion of other proteins. (A) The bacterially expressed fusion protein of the maltose binding protein (MBP) with NAP57 (lane 3)	 but not that with the MS2 bacteriophage coat protein (MCP; lane 1) retains recombinant ... To map the NAP57-interacting domain of SHQ1	 its sequence was scanned for conserved domains using the NCBI conserved domain architecture retrieval tool (CDART) and the UCSC genome browser. In addition to a central SHQ1-unique domain (pfam04925)	 only the first 90 amino acids contain a conserved domain	 termed CS for CHORD-containing proteins and Sgt1 (Shirasu et al. 1999). The CS domain is homologous to the HSP90 cochaperone p23 and to HSP20	 whose main function is to interact with other proteins and which has been demonstrated to simultaneously interact with HSP90 and another protein (Lee et al. 2004; Boter et al. 2007). Therefore	 it was surprising when the recombinant CS domain of SHQ1 (SHQ1-CS) failed binding to MBP-NAP57 (Fig. 1B	 lane 6)	 whereas the other part of SHQ1	 SHQ1-Î”CS	 did (Fig. 1B	 lane 7). Hence	 SHQ1-NAP57 interaction occurred independent of the CS domain	 which does not preclude an essential role for this domain in SHQ1 function (Singh et al. 2009).  To dissect the interactions of SHQ1 with other proteins	 we employed a previously established in vitro translation-immunoprecipitation assay (Wang and Meier 2004; Darzacq et al. 2006). Reported crystal structures of homologous complexes subsequently validated interactions identified by this assay (Li and Ye 2006; Manival et al. 2006; Rashid et al. 2006; Leulliot et al. 2007). In vitro translated	 HA-tagged SHQ1 failed to coprecipitate NAF1 (Fig. 1C	 lane 4) but precipitated NAP57 (Fig. 1C	 lane 6). Interestingly	 no NAF1 was associated with the coprecipitating NAP57 (Fig. 1C	 lane 8)	 indicating a possible competition for NAP57 between SHQ1 and NAF1. Indeed	 increasing the amount of NAF1 in the input	 while keeping that of SHQ1 constant (Fig. 1D	 lanes 2	3)	 was accompanied by a loss of SHQ1 coprecipitation (Fig. 1D	 cf. lanes 5 and 6). HA-tagged NHP2 alone and in the context of the H/ACA core trimer failed to precipitate SHQ1 (Fig. 1E	 lanes 2	4). Similarly	 HA-NOP10 in the presence of NHP2 and additionally NAP57 (i.e.	 the core trimer) failed to precipitate SHQ1 (Fig. 1F	 lanes 2	4). In summary	 SHQ1 in vitro directly interacted with NAP57 alone but not in the context of the core trimer or NAF1 (Fig. 1G). Moreover	 SHQ1 failed to interact with NOP10	 NHP2	 or NAF1 alone.  We previously documented a NAF1-RNP association in cell lysates that is not observed in intact cells (Kittur et al. 2006). Therefore	 we aimed to confirm these interactions of SHQ1 in vivo using our nuclear tethering assay (Darzacq et al. 2006). Specifically	 SHQ1 constructs fused to the lac repressor (LacI) were transfected into a cell line with arrays of the lac operator stably integrated in its genome. The resulting nuclear sites of LacI-SHQ1 concentration were interrogated for enrichment of endogenous proteins using indirect immunofluorescence (Fig. 2). In this manner	 SHQ1 recruited endogenous NAP57 (Fig. 2A	 panels 1	2	 arrows)	 which otherwise was mostly confined to H/ACA RNPs in nucleoli. However	 unlike nucleolar NAP57	 that associated with SHQ1 was free of H/ACA RNAs (Fig. 2A	 panel 3	 arrows). SHQ1 recruitment of NAP57 was specific because the CS domain of SHQ1 alone (consistent with the in vitro results) failed to do so (Fig. 2B	 arrows)	 whereas SHQ1 lacking the CS domain recruited NAP57 without H/ACA RNAs (Fig. 2C	 arrows). Finally	 full-length SHQ1 recruited neither NOP10	 NHP2	 GAR1	 nor NAF1 (Fig. 2Dâ€“G	 arrows). Therefore	 the nuclear tethering data corroborated the in vitro findings that SHQ1 binding of NAP57 precluded association with any other H/ACA RNP core component. In agreement with this	 GFP-tagged SHQ1	 unlike NAF1 (Kittur et al. 2006)	 failed to coprecipitate NAP57 associated H/ACA RNA E3 (data not shown). The mutually exclusive interaction of SHQ1 and NAF1 with NAP57 suggests a sequential action of these assembly factors.  FIGURE 2. FIGURE 2. In vivo	 SHQ1 only binds NAP57 alone. Indirect immunofluorescence of transfected LacI-SHQ1 constructs tethered to lac operator repeats stably integrated into the genome of U2OS cells (arrows) and triple labeled for LacI (panel 1)	 the indicated endogenous ... SHQ1 localization and dynamics  To localize endogenous SHQ1	 we raised polyclonal peptide antibodies for indirect immunofluorescence experiments. SHQ1 localized to the nucleoplasm in a granular pattern but was excluded from nucleoli identified by nucleolin (Fig. 3A) and from Cajal bodies identified by coilin (Fig. 3B). Due to the small size of Cajal bodies	 0.2-Î¼m optical sections through an entire nucleus were acquired and deconvolved using a Huygens algorithm. Maximum projections of 22 sections are depicted in Figure 3B	 panels 1 and 2	 whereas only the single 0.2-Î¼m-thick plane with the maximum intensity of each Cajal body is shown magnified underneath (Fig. 3B	 panels Iâ€“III). Overall	 this localization further supported that SHQ1 was absent from mature H/ACA RNPs in nucleoli and Cajal bodies.  FIGURE 3. FIGURE 3. Localization of endogenous and exogenous SHQ1. (A	B) Indirect double immunofluorescence of endogenous SHQ1 (panel 1) and nucleolin and coilin (A	B	 respectively	 panel 2)	 and corresponding phase contrast and differential interference contrast images ... Surprisingly	 exogenously expressed	 GFP-tagged SHQ1 was primarily cytoplasmic (Fig. 3C). This apparently inconsistent localization of endogenous and exogenous SHQ1 was reminiscent of that of NAF1	 which shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Kittur et al. 2006). To test if SHQ1 also shuttled	 GFP-SHQ1 and RFP-NAF1 were coexpressed and the cells incubated with Leptomycin B	 an inhibitor of CRM1-mediated export. After 3 h	 all of NAF1 accumulated in the nucleoplasm	 whereas SHQ1 equilibrated between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 3D). This differential localization of GFP-SHQ1 and RFP-NAF1 was independent of their relative expression levels	 suggesting that	 consistent with our biochemical data (Fig. 1C)	 they were not complexed. The only partial nuclear accumulation of GFP-SHQ1 in the presence of Leptomycin B indicated that not all of it shuttled or that its export occurred by a pathway in addition to that mediated by CRM1. For example	 there could be a limiting cytosolic factor for SHQ1 import or part of SHQ1 was actively retained. Significantly	 even when concentrated in the nucleoplasm	 SHQ1 was excluded from nucleoli	 the sites of mature H/ACA RNPs (Fig. 3D	 panel 1).  We previously identified NAF1 (together with NAP57	 NOP10	 and NHP2) at the site of transcription of an inducible H/ACA RNA (Darzacq et al. 2006) and tested here in the same cell system	 if SHQ1 was also recruited to nascent H/ACA RNAs. SHQ1 was absent from most (98.4%	 n = 123) H/ACA RNA transcription sites (Fig. 3E). This was not due to an inability to enter nuclei because SHQ1 accumulated at nuclear arrays of lac operators (Fig. 2A	Dâ€“G) and shuttled (Fig. 3D). These data are consistent with the lack of cotranscriptional association of yeast Shq1p with H/ACA RNA genes in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (Yang et al. 2005). The absence of SHQ1 from nascent H/ACA RNA was consistent with its interaction with NAP57 precluding that of other H/ACA components (Figs. 1	 	2)2) because NOP10	 NHP2	 and NAF1 together with NAP57 associate with H/ACA RNA transcription sites (Darzacq et al. 2006). Therefore	 SHQ1 appears to act prior to NAF1 in H/ACA RNP biogenesis.  SHQ1- and NAF1-dependent H/ACA RNP assembly in vitro  Having established SHQ1 interactions and localization	 we tested if	 like its yeast counterpart	 it functioned in H/ACA RNP biogenesis. For this purpose	 we used a previously developed reconstitution system of functional H/ACA RNPs (Wang and Meier 2004). Specifically	 HeLa cytosolic S-100 extract was incubated with an in vitro transcribed H/ACA RNA and	 after pre-incubation	 with its cognate target RNA. Only in the presence of its specific guide RNA was the uridine of the site-specifically labeled target RNA isomerized to pseudouridine (Fig. 4A). This indicated that the H/ACA RNA was packaged into an RNP and that the extract contained all factors required for functional RNP assembly. Therefore	 pseudouridylase activity of the E3 H/ACA RNP was used as a measure for functional RNP assembly (Fig. 4B	 solid bars	 lanes 1	2). Addition of increasing amounts of NAP57 antibodies before or simultaneously with the E3 H/ACA RNA inhibited RNP assembly (Fig. 4B	 solid bars	 lanes 3	4). Antibody addition after RNP assembly impacted activity less (Fig. 4B	 open bars	 lanes 6	7)	 consistent with the fact that H/ACA RNPs bound to NAP57 antibodies were still active (Wang et al. 2002). In subsequent experiments	 the assembly of functional RNPs was expressed relative to the pseudouridylation activity observed after reconstitution in the absence of exogenous factors.  FIGURE 4. FIGURE 4. SHQ1 functions in H/ACA RNP assembly in vitro (Aâ€“E) and in vivo (Fâ€“H). (A) Autoradiograph of a thin layer chromatogram on which uridine (U) was separated from pseudouridine (Î¨) after liberation from a site-specifically 32P-labeled ... In this in vitro reconstitution system	 antibodies to NAF1 inhibited RNP assembly but failed to interfere with pseudouridylase activity if added after RNP biogenesis was allowed to proceed (Fig. 4C). These results were consistent with NAF1 being a bona fide assembly factor and indicated that our extracts replicated assembly factor-dependent H/ACA RNP biogenesis. Antibodies to SHQ1	 although recognizing SHQ1 in the extracts on Western blots (data not shown)	 failed to interfere with assembly and pseudouridylase activity	 i.e.	 were not inhibitory (Fig. 4D). However	 addition of recombinant SHQ1 (Fig. 1A	 lane 2) did interfere with assembly but not activity	 consistent with being required during assembly but not for activity (Fig. 4E	 lanes 1â€“8). This inhibitory effect was apparently related to its interaction with NAP57 because only SHQ1 without its CS domain (which is responsible for NAP57 interaction)	 but not the CS domain alone	 behaved like the full-length protein (Fig. 4E	 lanes 9â€“12).  SHQ1 is required for H/ACA RNA accumulation in mammalian cells  To test for the involvement of SHQ1 in H/ACA RNP biogenesis in vivo	 we used siRNAs to knock it down. Knockdown of SHQ1 and subsequent induction of the Î²-globin construct harboring the H/ACA RNA E3 in its second intron in our inducible U2OS cell line (Darzacq et al. 2006) prevented stable accumulation of E3 but not of Î²-globin mRNA	 as assessed by RNase protection analysis (Fig. 4F	 lane 3). Previous experiments demonstrated that both NAP57 and the assembly factor NAF1 were required for stable accumulation of E3 in those cells (Darzacq et al. 2006). In control experiments	 mock siRNA treatment or knockdown of fibrillarin had no effect on H/ACA RNA accumulation (Fig. 4F	 lanes 1	2). These data indicated that SHQ1 was required for integration of newly transcribed E3 into stable H/ACA RNPs.  Western blots confirmed that transfection of the respective siRNAs significantly reduced the levels of SHQ1 and NAP57 relative to mock-treated cells	 both HeLa and U2OS (Fig. 4G). The amounts of SHQ1 in detergent whole cell extracts were compared to those of Î±-tubulin	 whereas those of NAP57 and NHP2 in 0.5 M salt extracts were compared to those of the nucleolar protein Nopp140. The requirement for differential extraction of SHQ1 compared with NAP57 and NHP2 further supported a lack of association of SHQ1 with mature H/ACA RNPs in the cell. Knockdown of NAP57 led to a concomitant loss of NHP2 but left SHQ1 levels unaffected (Fig. 4G	 lane 4). In contrast	 knockdown of SHQ1 caused a slight but reproducible reduction of both NAP57 and NHP2 (Fig. 4G	 lane 3). Interestingly	 knockdown of the C/D box core protein fibrillarin specifically increased the cellular levels of NAP57 and NHP2 but not of SHQ1 (Fig. 4G	 lane 2). Therefore	 a loss of C/D RNPs may have caused stabilization rather than increased synthesis of H/ACA RNPs.  To assess the impact of the knockdown of SHQ1 on various snoRNAs	 total RNA was extracted from the transfected cells and analyzed by Northern blot (Fig. 4H). Because telomerase RNA (hTR) was not detectable in U2OS cells	 which maintain their telomeres through an alternative (ALT) pathway (Bryan et al. 1997)	 we included HeLa cells in all our analyses. Knockdown of SHQ1 caused a loss of hTR and a moderate but clear reduction of two H/ACA RNAs	 the essential U17/E1 and E3 (Fig. 4H	 lane 3). In contrast	 the C/D RNA	 snR39B	 which is expressed from a different intron of the same gene as E3 (the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A	 isoform 2	 eIF4A2)	 remained unaffected. These data indicated that eIF4A2 was properly expressed but E3 specifically failed to be stabilized	 apparently due to lack of association with the reduced levels of H/ACA core trimer. Surprisingly	 therefore	 both excess SHQ1 (Fig. 4E) and SHQ1 reduction (Fig. 4G	H) impaired H/ACA RNP biogenesis	 indicating that specific levels of SHQ1 are essential to the cell. Knockdown of NAP57 had a similar but generally more pronounced effect on the H/ACA RNAs	 as that of SHQ1 (Fig. 4H	 lane 4). It is possible that this difference is due to a lower knockdown efficiency of SHQ1	 which required a combination of three siRNAs. Interestingly	 whereas knockdown of fibrillarin led to the expected loss of the C/D RNA snR39B	 it increased the levels of all H/ACA RNAs (Fig. 4H	 lane 2)	 mirroring the increase in NAP57 and NHP2 (Fig. 4G	 lane 2). Although the reason for this observation is not clear	 similar effects were observed previously (Hoareau-Aveilla et al. 2006). This increase included hTR	 which is expressed from its own promoter	 and E3	 which is expressed from of the same gene as snR39B. Therefore	 a loss of C/D RNPs caused not only an apparent increase of H/ACA RNAs	 due to lower levels of ribosomal RNAs in total RNA extracts	 but an increase of entire H/ACA RNPs. The increase was apparently caused by stabilization rather than synthesis of H/ACA RNPs because only the core proteins	 but not the assembly factor SHQ1	 were increased (Fig. 4G	 lane 2). Finally	 none of the knockdowns affected the levels of the spliceosomal snRNA U1 (Fig. 4H). In summary	 these data showed that SHQ1 is required for the quantitative accumulation of all H/ACA RNPs tested	 including telomerase	 apparently through stabilization of NAP57 and thereby of the H/ACA core trimer.  Go to: DISCUSSION We dissected the function and molecular interactions of human SHQ1	 the mammalian counterpart to the yeast H/ACA RNP assembly factor Shq1p. SHQ1 is required for the stable accumulation of all H/ACA RNPs tested	 including telomerase. Unlike all other H/ACA components	 SHQ1 only binds to the free pseudouridine synthase NAP57	 i.e.	 in the absence of other H/ACA proteins or RNAs. This is consistent with the nucleoplasmic localization of SHQ1 but its exclusion from nucleoli and Cajal bodies	 the sites of mature H/ACA RNPs	 and from H/ACA RNA transcription sites. Moreover	 it implicates SHQ1 in an early step of RNP biogenesis because all H/ACA core proteins	 except GAR1	 and the assembly factor NAF1 join NAP57 for cotranscriptional association with H/ACA RNAs. Specifically	 we propose that SHQ1 functions as a NAP57 chaperone accompanying NAP57 from the time of synthesis until association with NOP10 and NHP2 (forming the core trimer)	 and with NAF1 at the nascent H/ACA RNA.  Several lines of evidence support such a mode of SHQ1 function. First	 NAP57 alone is unstable. For example	 when it is expressed in mammalian	 insect	 or bacterial cells	 it fails to fold properly	 as attested by mislocalization and precipitation (Darzacq et al. 2006; Normand et al. 2006). In contrast	 NAP57 is stable and soluble when fused to the maltose binding protein (Fig. 1A). Second	 SHQ1	 although nuclear at steady state	 shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm but lacks a classical nuclear localization signal. Therefore	 it may depend on those of other proteins	 such as the multiple nuclear localization signals of NAP57 (Meier and Blobel 1994; Heiss et al. 1999; Youssoufian et al. 1999). Third	 SHQ1 has to act before cotranscriptional association of NAP57 with H/ACA RNA and other core proteins because SHQ1 only binds NAP57 alone and because	 once assembled with the core trimer	 H/ACA RNAs will no longer exchange (Wang and Meier 2004; Kittur et al. 2006). Therefore	 SHQ1 may function as a NAP57 chaperone and/or licensing factor marking it ready for RNP assembly.  The presence of a CS domain	 which is homologous to the HSP90 cochaperone p23 and to the HSP90-interacting domain of Sgt1 (Lee et al. 2004)	 at the N terminus of SHQ1 was interesting given the recent implication of HSP90 in the biogenesis of box C/D and H/ACA RNPs	 including telomerase (Boulon et al. 2008; Venteicher et al. 2008; Zhao et al. 2008). Since the C-terminal part of SHQ1 bound to NAP57	 was it possible that its CS domain recruited HSP90 to aid in RNP biogenesis? Apparently not	 because geldanamycin	 an inhibitor of ATP binding to HSP90 (Stebbins et al. 1997)	 had no effect on SHQ1-dependent H/ACA RNP assembly in our cell free reconstitution system and in our H/ACA RNA-inducible cell line (data not shown). Moreover	 excess amounts of SHQ1 without its CS domain	 but not the CS domain alone	 negatively impacted H/ACA RNP assembly (Fig. 4E). Perhaps	 the CS domain of SHQ1 does not bind to HSP90 or does so in a distinct manner	 like the differential binding of the CS domains of Sgt1 and p23 (Zhang et al. 2008). Indeed	 a very recent study indicates that the CS domain of SHQ1 fails to bind HSP90 (Singh et al. 2009). Regardless	 SHQ1 and NAF1 are the only bona fide assembly factors for H/ACA RNPs.  Although the function of the CS domain of SHQ1 and a possible associated role of HSP90 in the biogenesis of H/ACA RNPs remains elusive	 it is tempting to speculate that they were instrumental in the identification of Cbf5p (yeast NAP57) as a low affinity centromere binding factor (Jiang et al. 1993). Specifically	 the founding CS domain containing protein Sgt1p is required for the assembly of the yeast kinetochore complex CBF3 (Kitagawa et al. 1999). CBF3 includes Cbf2p/Ndc10p	 and a temperature-sensitive mutation in cbf2/ndc10 is rescued by overexpression of CBF5 (Jiang et al. 1993). Perhaps this rescue is mediated indirectly through the CS domain of Shq1p (instead of that of Sgt1p) while bound to Cbf5p.  Unexpectedly	 no interaction of human SHQ1 with NHP2 or NAF1 was observed	 although such interactions had been reported for their yeast counterparts (Fatica et al. 2002; Yang et al. 2002). Possibly the different approaches used to identify these interactions or species differences account for this discrepancy. Nevertheless	 the fact that we failed to observe any of these interactions in vitro and in vivo suggests that at least the mammalian SHQ1 only binds to NAP57 but not to NHP2 and NAF1 or to any other H/ACA component. Moreover	 the finding that SHQ1 only binds NAP57 alone but not in the context of other proteins or mature RNPs also contradicts a recent study reporting recruitment of Cajal body components	 including H/ACA RNPs	 to SHQ1 tethered in the nucleus (Kaiser et al. 2008). However	 based on our inherent consistent biochemical (Fig. 1) and tethering data (Fig. 2)	 and	 importantly	 on the absence of endogenous SHQ1 from Cajal bodies (Fig. 3B)	 SHQ1 only binds to NAP57 alone.  Establishing a role for SHQ1 in H/ACA RNP biogenesis before that of NAF1 raises the question as to the function of NAF1 shuttling. NAF1 binds NAP57 at the site of H/ACA RNA transcription and subsequently is replaced by GAR1 to form mature H/ACA RNPs (Darzacq et al. 2006). Before this role	 NAF1 might be involved in the import of NOP10 and NHP2	 which do not possess classical nuclear localization signals. However	 NOP10 and NHP2 are sufficiently small for passive diffusion into the nucleus	 and in nuclear tethering assays	 neither protein was recruited to NAF1 lacking its NAP57-interacting domain (data not shown). Alternatively	 NAF1 may be involved in the nuclear export of the very recently discovered class of H/ACA RNAs that harbors microRNAs (Ender et al. 2008). Obviously	 there is plenty more work ahead to dissect the detailed function of the two (and perhaps more) H/ACA RNP assembly factors.   Abstract H/ACA ribonucleoprotein particles are essential for ribosomal RNA and telomerase RNA processing and metabolism. Shq1p has been identified as an essential eukaryotic H/ACA small nucleolar (sno) ribonucleoparticle (snoRNP) biogenesis and assembly factor. Shq1p is postulated to be involved in the early biogenesis steps of H/ACA snoRNP complexes	 and Shq1p depletion leads to a specific decrease in H/ACA small nucleolar RNA levels and to defects in ribosomal RNA processing. Shq1p contains two predicted domains as follows: an N-terminal CS (named after CHORD-containing proteins and SGT1) or HSP20-like domain	 and a C-terminal region of high sequence homology called the Shq1 domain. Here we report the crystal structure and functional studies of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Shq1p CS domain. The structure consists of a compact anti-parallel Î²-sandwich fold that is composed of two Î²-sheets containing four and three Î²-strands	 respectively	 and a short Î±-helix. Deletion studies showed that the CS domain is required for the essential functions of Shq1p. Point mutations in residues Phe-6	 Gln-10	 and Lys-80 destabilize Shq1p in vivo and induce a temperature-sensitive phenotype with depletion of H/ACA small nucleolar RNAs and defects in rRNA processing. Although CS domains are frequently found in co-chaperones of the Hsp90 molecular chaperone	 no interaction was detected between the Shq1p CS domain and yeast Hsp90 in vitro. These results show that the CS domain is essential for Shq1p function in H/ACA snoRNP biogenesis in vivo	 possibly in an Hsp90-independent manner.  Modification of uridine to pseudouridine in ribosomal RNA and some spliceosomal RNAs is catalyzed by highly specialized ribonucleoparticle (RNP)3 complexes called box H/ACA RNPs (1-5). Depending on their site of maturation and action H/ACA RNPs are classified into two classes	 small nucleolar RNPs (snoRNPs) and small Cajal body RNPs. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae	 H/ACA snoRNPs contain four proteins: Nhp2p (L7ae in archaea (6) and Cbf5p	 also called dyskerin	 in humans (7))	 Nop10p	 Gar1p	 and a single small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA)	 specific to each snoRNP (8-11). Cbf5p provides the pseudouridylase activity to the complex	 and the snoRNA component provides the â€œguide RNAâ€ for positioning the substrate RNA for modification (8	10	 12-15). The 3â€² end of human telomerase RNA (hTR) contains an H/ACA scaRNA domain that binds the H/ACA proteins and is required for 3â€² end processing	 accumulation	 and localization of hTR to Cajal bodies (16-19). In archaea	 the assembly of H/ACA snoRNP appears to proceed by assembly of the protein components	 followed by the incorporation of the H/ACA RNA (8	 20-23). In eukaryotes	 the assembly and final maturation of the holoenzyme RNP are more complicated	 possibly because of subcellular compartmentalization	 and require accessory proteins (22	 24). Two proteins specifically found in eukaryotes	 Naf1p and Shq1p	 were initially identified in yeast as factors involved in the assembly of H/ACA snoRNPs (23-25). Both Shq1p and Naf1p are essential proteins	 and their depletion leads to the loss of H/ACA snoRNAs (22	 24). Shq1p and Naf1p interact with the H/ACA RNP components Cbf5p and Nhp2p as shown by high throughput proteomic approaches and by directed protein interaction studies (24	 26-28). Both Naf1p and Gar1p contain a central domain that forms a six-stranded Î²-barrel fold and interact competitively with Cbf5p using this â€œcore-Gar1â€ domain (29).  Although Shq1p was first identified in yeast (24)	 orthologues have been found in all eukaryotic genomes investigated	 including human (22). Shq1p is not associated with the precursor or mature RNPs and is localized in the nucleoplasm (24) rather than in the nucleolus or Cajal bodies where mature H/ACA RNPs reside. It was therefore proposed that Shq1p is involved in the early biogenesis steps of H/ACA snoRNPs. However	 Shq1p does not share any homology with either Naf1p or Gar1p	 and its mode of action remains unclear. Based on the Saccharomyces Genome Data base annotations and domain predictions	 Shq1p seems to be a modular protein with two predicted domains in its sequence (Fig. 1A). The C-terminal half contains a region of high sequence homology with other Shq1 proteins called the Shq1 domain	 but this region shows no identified folding motif. The N-terminal region of the protein has a predicted CS (named after CHORD-containing proteins and SGT1) or HSP20-like domain	 which is found in a number of co-chaperones for heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) (30-34)	 and hence is presumed to be an Hsp90 (Hsp82p in yeast) binding domain. The CS	 HSP20-like	 and p23-like domains belong to the HSP20 domain superfamily.  FIGURE 1. FIGURE 1. Deletion analysis and stability of Shq1p truncated mutants. A	 domain organization of Shq1p and complementation of the shq1Î” strain by the various truncation mutants. Numbers refer to SHQ1 amino acid residues. Cells were grown in plates containing ... We have determined the x-ray crystal structure of the CS domain of Shq1p and investigated its importance for Shq1p function. The structure consists of a Î²-sandwich immunoglobulin light chain fold (35). Like other CS domains	 the CS domain of Shq1p is primarily composed of two Î²-sheets (30	31	33	 36)	 but it has an additional short helix at the C terminus. We show that the Shq1p CS domain is essential for growth in S. cerevisiae and that the integrity of the CS domain is required for the function of Shq1p in vivo. Based on the structure and sequence conservation among Shq1 proteins	 we investigated the effect of three single point mutations	 F6A	 Q10A	 and K80A	 on Shq1p structure and function. All three mutations destabilized the tertiary structure of the CS domain	 albeit to differing extents. Incorporation of these mutations in Shq1p resulted in a temperature-sensitive growth phenotype	 specific depletion of H/ACA snoRNAs	 and rRNA processing defects. NMR chemical shift mapping showed no interaction between the Shq1p CS domain and Hsp82p	 suggesting that the Shq1p CS domain does not have a canonical role as an Hsp82p co-chaperone protein.  Go to: EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Protein Expression and Purification for Structural Studiesâ€”CS (residues 1-101) and CS-L (residues 1-145) constructs were PCR-amplified using yeast genomic DNA as a template and cloned into pET46 LIC/Ek (Novagen). F6A	 Q10A	 and K80A mutant constructs of the CS domain were made by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene)	 and plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells for protein expression. For selenomethionine labeling	 E. coli B834 (DE3) cells (Novagen) were used. Cells were grown either in LB medium (for unlabeled proteins) or M9 medium (for selenomethionine	 13C	15N-labeled	 and 15N-labeled protein). Cultures were grown at 37 Â°C until an A600 of 0.6 was reached	 and then the temperature was lowered to 28 Â°C (22 Â°C for the F6A and Q10A mutants) and the cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-Î²-d-galactopyranoside for 16 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation	 and the pellets were resuspended in the binding buffer (30 ml; buffer A: 50 mm NaH2PO4	 pH 8	 300 mm NaCl	 10 mm Î²-mercaptoethanol). Cells were lysed by sonication on ice and centrifuged to remove cell debris. The supernatant was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (5 ml)	 which had been pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with buffer A	 followed by buffer B (buffer A supplemented with 20 mm imidazole) and were eluted with buffer C (buffer A supplemented with 250 mm imidazole). Proteins were further purified by Superdex S75 preparative gel filtration. Yeast Hsp82p was PCR-amplified and cloned into pET30 LIC/Xa. Protein was expressed in E. coli at room temperature and purified over a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column followed by gel filtration on Superdex S75 column. All proteins were >95% purified as judged by SDS-PAGE. The buffer for NMR and CD spectroscopy was 20 mm NaH2PO4	 pH 7.2	 100 mm NaCl	 and 2 mm dithiothreitol	 0.02% NaN3 and for crystallization was 20 mm Tris base	 pH 7.2	 100 mm NaCl	 2 mm dithiothreitol	 and 0.02% NaN3.  NMR Spectroscopyâ€”Uniformly 13C	15N-labeled samples of CS(WT) were used for NMR assignments	 and 15N-labeled samples of WT and mutant CS domains were used for other NMR experiments. NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker DRX 600-MHz and DRX 800-MHz spectrometers equipped with cryoprobes. NMR samples contained 0.3 to 0.8 mm protein. For the 1H-15N HSQC spectra	 a total of 1024 complex points in t2	 and 256 complex points at t1 increments were acquired. The backbone assignments for CS(WT) were obtained by standard methods using the CBCACONH/CBCANH and HNCACO/HNCO pairs of triple resonance experiments at 22 Â°C (37). NMR titrations were carried out by adding unlabeled purified Hsp82p to 15N-labeled CS or CS-L and recording 1H-15N TROSY-HSQC spectra. For the 1H-15N TROSY-HSQC spectra	 a total of 1024 complex points in t2	 and 256 complex points at t1 increments were acquired. All the titrations were carried out at 22 Â°C at 600 MHz. NMR data were processed using the Bruker program Xwin-NMR version 3.5 and assigned using the Sparky software program (T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller	 SPARKY version 3	 University of California	 San Francisco).  Crystallization	 Data Collection	 and Structure Determinationâ€”Crystallization was carried out with a hanging drop	 vapor-diffusion method by mixing equal volumes of protein and reservoir solutions (0.1 m BisTris	 pH 6.0	 0.2 m ammonium sulfate	 25% w/v PEG 3350). Crystals appeared under the same conditions for both normal and selenomethionine derivatives within 24 h. Crystals grew to maximum size of 0.2 Ã— 0.2 Ã— 0.3 mm in 4 days and belonged to space group P21212. Unit cell dimensions and other parameters are given in Table 1.  TABLE 1 TABLE 1 Data collection and refinement statistics for Shq1p CS domain Data were collected at the Advanced Photon Source at beamline 24-ID-C. Data were processed with the DENZO/SCALE-PACK package (38). The selenomethionine derivative was measured at peak wavelength of 0.97949 Ã…. Datasets were of high quality and showed a strong anomalous signal. Macromolecular phasing was carried out by HKL2MAP (39). The resulting phases were improved by using the DM program (40) and used for an automated model building with the Arp/Warp software (40). The resulting model of about 90% completeness was inspected and finished manually with the program Coot (41). Restrained refinement enforced by the Refmac5 software was then performed and was followed by the addition of water molecules by using Arp/Warp (42). Final iterative rounds of model building and refinement were carried out using Coot (41) and PHENIX (43). Final data collection	 phasing	 and refinement statistics are presented in Table 1. Most of the model has a clear electron density	 with the exception of the N-terminal His tag (15 residues) and 3-4 C-terminal residues. Additionally	 some solvent-exposed side chains had no interpretable electron density. These parts were omitted in the final model. The R-factor of the presented structure is 22.5%	 and Rfree is 24.6%. All structure figures were drawn using PyMOL (DeLano Scientific	 San Carlos	 CA).  CD Spectroscopyâ€”CD spectra of the proteins were obtained on a J-715 spectropolarimeter (Jasco J715 model). Spectra were recorded using 1-mm path length quartz cuvettes. Each spectrum was recorded as an average of four scans. For thermal denaturation experiments	 spectra were monitored at 215 nm	 and the sample temperature was increased at a rate of 30 Â°C/h.  Cloningâ€”DNA cloning and DNA manipulations were performed as described (44). Plasmids expressing the GFP fusions in yeast were constructed by inserting DNA fragments containing the PCR-amplified SHQ1 open reading frame into pUG23 and pUG35 (45) using oligonucleotides with XbaI and EcoRI restriction sites. Constructs expressing Shq1p residues 1-483	 1-491	 1-500	 9-508	 18-508	 and 26-508 and point mutants F6A	 Q10A	 K18A	 S22A	 and K80A were amplified by PCR using specific oligonucleotides and inserted into pUG23.  Yeast Transformation and Maintenanceâ€”Yeast strains were maintained in synthetic medium (YNB) complemented with the appropriate amino acid mix. Glucose was added as carbon source to a final concentration of 2% (w/v) as indicated. Yeast cells were transformed using the lithium acetate method as described (46).  The shq1Î” knock-out strain was obtained using a PCR-based gene deletion strategy described in Ref. 47	 by homologous recombination of a DNA fragment containing the coding region of TRP marker flanked by the last 40 and first 40 nucleotides of the 5â€²- and 3â€²-untranslated region	 respectively	 of SHQ1. The TRP cassette was co-transformed with a plasmid containing a wild-type SHQ1 gene and URA3 auxotrophy marker (pUG35-SHQ1) in a wild-type yeast strain BMA64 (ura3-1; trp1; ade2-1; leu2-3	112; his3-11	15).  Western Blotsâ€”Whole-cell lysates were prepared at 4 Â°C from equal A600 amounts of exponentially growing yeast cultures. Cells were resuspended in a buffer containing 1.85 m NaOH	 7.4% Î²-mercaptoethanol	 and trichloroacetic acid at a final concentration of 5.48%. Lysates were centrifuged	 the pellets resuspended	 and the proteins fractionated by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was performed with anti-GFP (1:10	000) and anti-hexokinase (1:10	000) antibodies and revealed by ECL system using the Super SignalÂ® West Femto from Thermo Scientific Pierce Protein Research Products.  RNA Analysisâ€”Total RNA extractions and Northern blot analyses were performed as described (48). Oligonucleotides used for snoRNA probes are described in Ref. 48. Total RNA was extracted from cells incubated at 37 Â°C for different time intervals and hybridized against 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes. The 35 S pre-rRNA was detected using 5â€² ETS and 18 S probes; the 33 S pre-rRNA was detected using 18 S probe; the 27 S pre-rRNA was detected with the ITS2 probe; and the 20 S pre-rRNA was detected with A1-A2 probe as described (48).  Coordinate Depositionâ€”The structure factors and coordinates for Shq1p CS domain have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession code 3EUD).  Go to: RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Integrity of the CS Domain of Shq1p Is Required for Shq1p Essential Functionsâ€”To assess the importance of the putative CS domain of Shq1p in vivo	 a series of constructs harboring N-terminal deletions was designed (Fig. 1A) and expressed as GFP fusion proteins in S. cerevisiae. The CS or alternatively named HSP20-like domain is predicted to start at the precise N terminus of Shq1p and extends approximately to residue 145 (Fig. 1A). We also expressed a series of Shq1p C-terminal deletions (Fig. 1A) as controls. Strikingly	 proteins deleted of only a few amino acids from the N terminus of Shq1p (Shq1p 9-508) could not complement the SHQ1 knock-out and resulted in a lethal phenotype (Fig. 1	 A and B). In contrast	 C-terminal deletions of up to 17 residues did not affect cell growth (Fig. 1	 A and B).  To investigate whether these phenotypes were because of instability of the mutant proteins	 we monitored the expression levels of these constructs in a wild-type strain expressing these constructs in addition to the endogenous wild-type SHQ1 copy (Fig. 1C). The mutant proteins were detected using anti-GFP antibodies because these constructs were expressed as GFP fusions. Constructs expressing non-functional versions of Shq1p such as 9-508	 18-508	 and 26-508 were expressed to levels similar to wild type (Fig. 1C). Further deletions in the N-terminal domain resulted in protein instability (Fig. 1C)	 precluding us from drawing conclusions about these constructs. Overall the data obtained with the 9-508	 18-508	 and 26-508 constructs show that although stably expressed	 proteins lacking the first N-terminal amino acids of the Shq1p CS domain cannot functionally complement the absence of Shq1p. These data strongly suggest that the CS domain is required for Shq1p essential functions in vivo.  Structure of the Shq1p CS Domainâ€”These results led us to carry out further functional and structural characterization of the CS domain. Based on the predicted domain boundaries and secondary structure for the CS or HSP20-like domain of Shq1p	 we cloned	 expressed	 and purified two constructs	 CS (residues 1-101) and the longer CS-L (residues 1-145) which encompasses the entire N-terminal region containing the HSP20-like and CS domain (Fig. 1A). 15N-1H two-dimensional HSQC NMR spectra show that both protein constructs contain a well folded domain (Fig. 2). The backbone amides of the CS domain constructs were assigned using CBCACONH/CBCANH and HNCA/HNCOCA sets of triple resonance NMR spectra (see â€œExperimental Proceduresâ€). Comparison of the spectra of CS and CS-L reveals that all of the resonance peaks in the CS-L spectrum that are from the additional 44 C-terminal residues are in the region generally corresponding to unstructured or unfolded residues. In addition	 the amide resonances from the last âˆ¼25 residues of CS-L were not visible in the 1H-15N HSQC spectra	 consistent with this region being unstructured (Fig. 2). We recorded the 1H-15N HSQC of the CS-L construct under different salt	 pH	 and temperature values; however	 we did not observe these C-terminal amide resonances under any of these conditions. Thus	 the structured region of CS-L is entirely contained in CS. Crystallization screens were set up for both CS and CS-L; however	 crystals appeared only for CS. CS-L did not crystallize	 possibly because of the flexible C-terminal region in the protein.  FIGURE 2. FIGURE 2. 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the Shq1p CS domain. Overlay of 1H-15N HSQC spectra of Shq1p CS (red) and CS-L (cyan) proteins. Assignments of amide resonances of CS are indicated (K0 is a residue from the tag). The CS domain crystallized in the P21212 space group with six copies of the molecule in one asymmetric unit. However	 the CS domain	 as well as full-length Shq1p	 purified as monomers on a gel filtration column (data not shown). The NMR line widths are also consistent with what would be expected for a monomer. Attempts to solve the structure by molecular replacement using the structure of p23 (33) as a template were not successful. Therefore	 the structure was solved by the single anomalous diffraction method using a selenomethionine derivative. The final resolution of the structure was 2.4 Ã… (Fig. 3	 A and B). We did not observe electron density for the N-terminal His tag (first 15 residues) and the last four residues at the C terminus	 and these were therefore omitted in the final refinement and structure.  FIGURE 3. FIGURE 3. Crystal structure and sequence alignment of the Shq1p CS domain. A	 crystal structure of Shq1p CS domain at 2.4 Ã…. Stereo view of ribbon diagram. The secondary structure elements are labeled. B	 representative 2Fo - Fc electron density map	 ... The overall fold of Shq1p CS is a compact Î²-sandwich consisting of two Î²-sheets	 confirming that this region of Shq1p has a CS domain as predicted (Fig. 3A) (30	 33). The larger Î²-sheet is formed by Î²1 (residues 6-10)	 Î²2 (residues 14-20)	 Î²6 (residues 64-68)	 and Î²7 (residues 72-79) strands	 and the other Î²-sheet includes Î²3 (residues 32-36)	 Î²4 (residues 39-44)	 and Î²5 (residues 47-52) strands. The C-terminal residues 93-97 form a short helix Î±1	 which is usually not present in CS domains (Fig. 3A). The Î²-sandwich fold is maintained by the highly hydrophobic core of the protein	 which is made up of alternating hydrophobic side chains on each Î²-strand. Î²-Strands that are adjacent to each other in the primary sequence are connected by 3-4 residue turns	 and there are three well structured loops	 loop 1 between Î²2/Î²3	 loop 2 between Î²5/Î²6	 and loop 3 between Î²7/Î±1.  Sequence alignment of Shq1 from âˆ¼55 different species showed that the CS domain is conserved throughout many eukaryotic orthologues (22	 24) (Pfam data base). Fig. 3C shows the sequence alignment of eight Shq1 proteins from different species. Among the highly conserved residues	 Lys-80 is absolutely conserved	 whereas Phe-6	 Gln-10	 Phe-87	 Leu-96	 and Leu-97 are the most highly conserved residues (>90%). Of these	 based on their location and interactions in the structure	 F6A	 Q10A	 and K80A appeared to be important for the stability of the folded protein. Residues Phe-6 and Gln-10 are located in the Î²1 strand	 which is part of the first Î²-sheet. The aromatic ring of Phe-6 is located in the interior of the protein and makes a hydrophobic interaction with the side chain of Leu-97	 contributing to the folding of the domain. Interestingly	 Phe-6 was also found as one of the mutations in a screen for temperature-sensitive mutants using a random mutagenesis approach.4 The Gln-10 side chain O-Îµ1 and N-Îµ2 make hydrogen bonds with the backbone amide N and carbonyl O of Phe-87	 which is also a highly conserved residue. The side chain of the conserved Lys-80 is almost completely buried inside the hydrophobic interior of the protein	 and its backbone amide N makes a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Glu-13. Based on their location in the structure (Fig. 4F) and strong sequence conservation	 we characterized the effect of alanine substitutions of these residues on the CS domain structure and stability as described below.  FIGURE 4. FIGURE 4. 1H-15N HSQC and CD spectra of Shq1p CS domain mutants. A-D	 600-MHz 1H-15N HSQC NMR spectra of CS(F6A) (A and B) and CS(Q10A) (C and D) at 25 Â°C (A and C) and 37 Â°C (B and D). Spectra of CS(F6A) and CS(Q10A) are shown in cyan and ... Biophysical Characterization of CS Domain Mutantsâ€”Expression of the wild-type CS domain in E. coli was efficient	 yielding âˆ¼10 mg of purified protein per liter of LB or minimal media. However	 the expression levels of the CS(F6A) and CS(Q10A) mutants were >10-fold lower than the wild-type CS domain	 and (K80A) did not express in all of our expression attempts. We reasoned that CS(K80A) may have been unfolded and degraded	 and therefore there was no detectable expression of the full-length domain in E. coli.  To assess the effect of the amino acid substitutions on the CS domain structure	 1H-15N HSQC spectra were recorded as a function of temperature (15	22	25	30	 and 37 Â°C) for CS(F6A) and CS(Q10A) and compared with the spectra of CS(WT). CS(WT) was stable and showed spectra of a folded protein at all the investigated temperatures. At temperatures up to 25 Â°C	 CS(F6A) exhibited 1H-15N HSQC spectra of a folded protein	 although many peaks were shifted compared with the wild-type CS	 because of the substitution of Ala for the aromatic Phe (Fig. 4A). However	 at 30 Â°C many of the resonance peaks were broadened and/or shifted into the region of the spectrum typical for unfolded proteins or molten globules (âˆ¼8.3 ppm	 in 1H dimension). At 37 Â°C most of the resonances disappeared and were not recovered upon reacquisition of data at 25 Â°C	 indicating that the protein was irreversibly denatured (Fig. 4B). The 1H-15N HSQC spectra of CS(Q10A) show that the domain is already partially unfolded at 15 Â°C	 and it remains partially folded up to 25 Â°C (Fig. 4C). At 30 Â°C and above	 the peaks in the 1H-15N HSQC of CS(Q10A) disappeared because of denaturation (Fig. 4D). Analysis of the spectra indicates that for both CS(F6A) and CS(Q10A)	 the resonances that do not show chemical shift changes under conditions where the protein is still at least partially folded generally arise from residues far from the mutation site in the three-dimensional structure (data not shown).  We also checked the integrity and stability of the wild-type and mutant CS domains using CD spectroscopy. Because both wild-type and mutant proteins showed spectra typical for Î²-sheet protein	 we chose 215 nm (a characteristic minima for the Î²-sheet) to monitor the change in CD signal as a function of temperature (Fig. 4E). The melting temperature for the wild-type CS domain determined by this method was about 60 Â°C	 whereas the melting temperatures of F6A and Q10A protein were 44 and 45 Â°C	 respectively (Fig. 4E). In the case of CS(Q10A)	 an early melting transition was observed in the 15-30 Â°C range (Fig. 4E)	 suggesting that at least one region of the protein is undergoing a structural transition even at room temperature. These findings agree with our NMR results that show partial unfolding of CS(Q10A) at a lower temperature than for CS(F6A).  Point Mutations within the Shq1 CS Domain Destabilize Shq1p in Vivoâ€”The NMR and CD spectroscopy analyses of the Shq1p CS domain mutants showed that the selected point mutations significantly destabilize the fold of this domain in vitro	 and this destabilization is more severe for CS(Q10A) than for CS(F6A). Based on these results	 we predicted that these mutations would also destabilize Shq1p in vivo and might confer temperature-sensitive phenotypes if the CS domain contributes to Shq1p function in vivo	 as predicted from the domain deletion analysis (Fig. 1	 A and B). To test this hypothesis and investigate the effect of these mutations in vivo	 we introduced the F6A	 Q10A	 and K80A mutations into a plasmid expressing Shq1p as a GFP fusion protein	 and we transformed the plasmid into a strain where the SHQ1 chromosomal copy was disrupted and covered by a URA plasmid containing a wild-type SHQ1 copy. After selection of the transformants	 the URA plasmids carrying the wild-type SHQ1 copy were counter-selected by streaking strains on a medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (49)	 and strain viability was assessed by growth on plates at 25 and 37 Â°C (Fig. 5	 A and C). Shq1p(F6A) and Shq1p(Q10A) strains were viable at 25 Â°C but exhibited a growth defect at 37 Â°C. The Shq1p(K80A) strain exhibited a strong growth defect at 25 Â°C and loss of viability at 37 Â°C. These growth defects were confirmed by growth curves obtained from liquid cultures (Fig. 5	 B and D). All mutant strains exhibited longer generation times or growth arrest at 37 Â°C	 and the Shq1p(K80A) showed a slow growth phenotype even at 25 Â°C. To further investigate the molecular basis of the growth phenotypes observed for these mutants	 we monitored the levels of the Shq1p-GFP fusion protein expressed from these constructs. Although all the mutant proteins showed normal expression levels at 25 Â°C	 their levels were dramatically reduced at 37 Â°C (Fig. 5E)	 in contrast to the wild type that was unaffected. These results indicate that destabilizing the CS domain in the context of the full-length protein likely leads to degradation of Shq1p in vivo.  FIGURE 5. FIGURE 5. Effect of Shq1p point mutations on cell growth	 viability	 and Shq1p expression in shq1Î”. A and C	 growth of strains expressing wild-type (wt) Shq1p or the point mutants F6A	 Q10A	 and K80A. Serial dilutions were made at 25 Â°C (A) and ... Point Mutations in the CS Domain Result in H/ACA snoRNA Depletion and Defects in Pre-rRNA Processingâ€”We further investigated the effect of the Shq1p CS domain mutations on Shq1p function in vivo by analyzing H/ACA snoRNA accumulation in the CS domain mutants grown at 25 Â°C or shifted to 37 Â°C. Although H/ACA snoRNA levels were unaffected by shifting the wild-type strain to 37 Â°C	 all three strains expressing Shq1p CS domain mutants exhibited lower H/ACA snoRNA levels at the elevated temperature (Fig. 6A). Interestingly	 the level of depletion of H/ACA snoRNAs for the mutants correlated well with the growth defects and with the structural instability monitored by NMR and CD spectroscopy and protein expression levels in E. coli. For example	 the Shq1p(F6A) strain showed the weakest growth defect in vivo (Fig. 5)	 the highest stability of all CS mutants in vitro (Fig. 4	 A	 B and E)	 and the lowest level of H/ACA snoRNA depletion of the Shq1p mutant strains in vivo (Fig. 6A). The Shq1p(K80A) strain	 which shows a significant growth defect at 25 Â°C (Fig. 5	 B and C)	 exhibited a strong snoRNA depletion phenotype at this temperature (Fig. 6A) and could not be expressed in E. coli.  FIGURE 6. FIGURE 6. Effect of Shq1p mutant strains on H/ACA snoRNA expression and rRNA processing. A	 Northern blot analysis of snoRNA expression in strains expressing wild-type (wt) Shq1p or the point mutants F6A	 Q10A	 and K80A. Total RNA was extracted from cells incubated ... Importantly	 although the snoRNA depletion observed for all mutants at 37 Â°C is likely due to decreased Shq1p levels triggered by the thermal instability of the mutant proteins	 the depletion of H/ACA snoRNAs observed in the Shq1p(K80A) and Q10A strains at 25 Â°C cannot be attributed to protein depletion	 because protein levels were normal for these mutants at this temperature (Fig. 5E). This result further demonstrates that the CS domain is required for Shq1p function in vivo	 because mutations that do not result in degradation of the protein at 25 Â°C generate a growth defect and an H/ACA snoRNA depletion phenotype. Finally	 the levels of the C/D snoRNA snR190 were unaffected by the Shq1p CS domain mutations	 consistent with previous observations that Shq1p functions exclusively in H/ACA snoRNP assembly (24) (Fig. 6A).  Because the snR10 and snR30 H/ACA snoRNAs have been shown to participate in pre-ribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing (50	 51)	 we predicted that the depletion of these snoRNAs caused by the Shq1p CS domain mutations (Fig. 6A) would generate a delay or a defect in pre-rRNA processing in the Shq1p mutant strains	 as shown previously for Shq1p depletion (24). In agreement with this prediction	 we observed a decrease in the level of the 20 S and 27 S ribosomal RNAs processing intermediates after a shift of the Shq1p CS domain mutant strains to 37 Â°C (Fig. 6	 B and C)	 although the wild-type strain was largely unaffected. Because the onset of the rRNA processing defects observed in the Shq1p CS domain mutant strains occurred concomitantly to	 or after the H/ACA snoRNA depletion	 we conclude that this rRNA processing defect is likely due to H/ACA snoRNA depletion caused by the CS domain mutations	 rather than by a direct involvement of Shq1p in pre-rRNA processing	 as shown previously for Shq1p depletion (24).  Shq1p CS Domain Does Not Interact with Yeast Hsp90 in Vitroâ€”Hsp90 (yeast Hsp82p) is a general molecular chaperone responsible for structural maintenance and proper folding and regulation of specific target proteins involved in cell cycle control and signal transduction (32	 52). Several co-chaperones are known to bind and modulate the chaperone cycle of Hsp90. The CS/Hsp20-like domain is recognized as an Hsp90-binding module	 as these domains in several co-chaperones have been shown to interact directly with Hsp90 both in vivo and in vitro (30	 33). Recently	 Hsp90 was implicated in the biogenesis of the L7Ae family of RNPs	 including box C/D RNPs (53). Both Hsp90 and one of its co-chaperone proteins p23	 which is structurally similar to the CS domain (hence the CS domain is also called as p23-like domain)	 have also been shown to bind to hTERT and influence its assembly process with hTR (54	 55). Hsp82p was also reported to promote both the DNA binding and nucleotide extension properties of telomerase in yeast (56). We therefore investigated whether the Shq1p CS domain interacts with yeast Hsp90 (Hsp82p) by NMR	 using chemical shift perturbation experiments. The amide chemical shifts of Shq1p CS domain in 1H-15N HSQC spectra were monitored as a function of added unlabeled Hsp82p. No changes were observed in the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of Shq1p CS even with a 3-fold excess of Hsp82p	 indicating that there is no interaction between the two proteins under the NMR conditions (Fig. 7). We also checked the interaction between Shq1p CS-L and Hsp82p	 because a region near the C terminus of Sba1 (yeast p23) was found to interact with Hsp82p (31	 36) (discussed below). Again	 no spectral changes were observed upon addition of Hsp82p to CS-L	 indicating that the lack of binding to Hsp82p by the CS domain is not because of the absence of the extra 44 amino acids in the CS-L (HSP20-like) domain (data not shown). The CS (p23-like) domain/Hsp90 interaction is ATP-dependent in vivo (33)	 although both p23 and Sgt1 CS domain can also interact with Hsp90 in the absence of ATP in vitro (30	31	 33). To check whether ATP was required for interaction between Shq1p CS domain and Hsp82p	 we also performed the NMR titration in the presence of ATP. Addition of ATP did not result in formation of an Shq1p CS domain-Hsp82p complex (data not shown). In contrast to these results	 binding between Hsp90/Hsp82p and the p23	 human Sgt1	 and plant (Arabidopsis thaliana) Sgt1a CS domains	 without and with ATP	 has been detected using NMR chemical shift perturbation studies even at substoichiometric ratios of HSP90/82 to CS domain (30	 57).  FIGURE 7. FIGURE 7. NMR probing for binding of Hsp82p to Shq1p CS domain. 600-MHz 1H-15N TROSY HSQC of 15N-labeled Shq1p CS (red) and in the presence of 3-fold excess unlabeled Hsp82p (cyan) at 22 Â°C. No changes in either the line widths or chemical shifts of ... We compared the structure of the Shq1p CS domain with those of three proteins	 Sgt1 CS domain	 p23	 and Sba1	 which have been shown to interact with Hsp90 using NMR or crystallography and other biochemical methods (30	31	33	 36). Sgt1 is a subunit of the kinetochore and SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box) ubiquitin ligase complexes (58	 59)	 and p23 is a highly conserved protein that acts as a co-chaperone for Hsp90 and modulates its activity (33	36	 60). Sequence alignment of the Shq1p CS domain	 p23	 human Sgt1 CS domain	 and Sba1 (Fig. 8A) showed low homology (overall homology <15%	 identity <2%)	 but all have a similar tertiary fold (Fig. 8B). However	 there are significant differences among all of the proteins in the lengths of the Î²-strands	 the loops	 and the C-terminal region. The CS domain of Shq1p has a small Î±-helix in the C-terminal part that is replaced by a short Î²-strand in Sba1 and p23 and no structural element in Sgt1 CS domain (30	31	33	 36) (Fig. 8B). In Sba1 the lengths of the Î²-strands are shorter in comparison with the Shq1p CS domain (Fig. 8B).  FIGURE 8. FIGURE 8. Comparison of Shq1p CS domain	 Sgt1 CS domain	 Sba1	 and p23. A	 sequence alignment of Shq1p CS domain	 Sgt1 CS domain	 Sba1	 and p23. The boundaries of the constructs used for NMR or crystallization studies are shown in parentheses. For Shq1p	 additional ... The interactions between p23	 Sgt1 CS domain	 and plant Sgt1a CS domain and Hsp90 have been studied by NMR (30	 31). Chemical shift mapping of resonances that shifted or showed line broadening in the presence of Hsp90 was reported for p23 and a homology model of plant Sgt1a (30	 57). A more detailed interaction surface has been presented in the co-crystal structure of the complex of Hsp90 in an ATP-bound closed conformation with Sba1 (36). All of these studies localize the binding surface for Hsp90 on the CS domains to the face of the protein containing the Î²1Î²2Î²6Î²7 sheet.  Fig. 8A shows the residues of the p23 (blue box) and Sba1 (cyan box) that were shown to be involved in the complex formation with Hsp90. In the crystal structure of the Sba1Â·Hsp82pÂ·ATP complex	 the Sba1 interacts with Hsp82p at three distinct surface patches on the Î²1Î²2Î²6Î²7 sheet. The Hsp90-interacting surface of the p23 and homology-modeled plant Sgt1 CS domain	 identified by NMR chemical shift mapping	 only partially overlaps two of these patches. Furthermore	 based on an Hsp90-NterÂ·Sgt1-CS crystal structure and modeling of an Hsp90Â·Sgt1-CSÂ·Sba1 complex	 it has very recently been proposed that Sba1 (p23) and the Sgt1a CS domain bind at different sites on Hsp90 (61	 62). Although it is therefore difficult to identify specific differences in residues on the Î²1Î²2Î²6Î²7 surface of the CS domain that may account for the absence of Hsp90 binding to the Shq1p CS domain	 comparison of the surface charge distribution of Sba1	 p23	 and Sgt1 CS domains with Shq1p CS reveals a significant difference (Fig. 8C). The Sba1	 p23	 and Sgt1 CS domains all have a large basic surface patch on the Î²1Î²2Î²6Î²7 face of the structure (30). The Shq1p CS domain does not have such an extensive basic region (Fig. 8C)	 which might explain the lack of binding to Hsp82.  We also checked the levels of Shq1p and snoRNAs in Hsp82p deletion strains and did not find any difference in their levels (data not shown). Interestingly	 single alanine substitutions in CS surface residues Lys-18 and Ser-22 did not show any phenotype in vivo (data not shown). The equivalent residues in the Sba1Â·Hsp82pÂ·ATP complex are in the binding interface. Based on these observations it appears unlikely that the Shq1p CS domain binds to and functions as a co-chaperone for Hsp90. However	 we cannot rule out the possibility that other regions of Shq1 or accessory proteins may interact with Hsp90. Although CS domains generally interact with Hsp90	 the Hsp20 superfamily Î²-sandwich fold is found in other proteins such as small heat shock proteins (sHSPs)	 e.g. MjHSP16.5 from Methanococcus jannaschii and HSP16.9B from wheat. These proteins act as molecular chaperones but do not interact with the Hsp90 (30	 63). sHSPs are involved in a variety of cellular functions	 which include a role in the process of thermo-tolerance and maintenance of protein homeostasis in the cell. They form multimeric complexes with folding intermediates of substrate proteins (63-66). Hence	 it is possible that Shq1p has a chaperone activity independent of Hsp90 that is required for the proper folding and assembly of H/ACA RNP components.  Summaryâ€”In this study we determined the crystal structure of the Shq1p CS domain. Based on the structure	 we addressed two questions as follows: first	 whether the CS domain is important for Shq1p function and has a role in H/ACA snoRNP biogenesis; and second	 whether it interacts with the Hsp90 molecular chaperone like the CS domains of the co-chaperones p23	 Sba1	 and Sgt1. Our results show that the CS domain is required for the structural integrity and functions of Shq1p in vivo. There is a clear correlation between the structural properties and thermal stabilities of the isolated CS domains (WT and mutants) determined in vitro and the functional properties of these mutants observed in vivo. Several point mutations that destabilize the CS domain in vitro	 as assessed by NMR and CD spectroscopy	 generate growth defects	 H/ACA snoRNA depletion phenotypes	 and defects in rRNA processing	 even in conditions when mutant Shq1p protein levels are normal (Q10A and K80A). The Shq1p CS domain has the same fold as the CS domains of Hsp90 co-chaperones Sgt1	 p23	 and Sba1. However there are differences in the structure of the Shq1p CS domain in comparison with CS domains that interact with the Hsp90 molecular chaperone family	 which may account for its lack of direct interaction with Hsp82p Annotation of prostate cancer genomes provides a foundation for discoveries that can impact disease understanding and treatment. Concordant assessment of DNA copy number	 mRNA expression	 and focused exon resequencing in 218 prostate cancer tumors identified the nuclear receptor coactivator NCOA2 as an oncogene in ~11 percent of tumors. Additionally	 the androgen-driven TMPRSS2-ERG fusion was associated with a previously unrecognized	 prostate-specific deletion at chromosome 3p14 that implicates FOXP1	 RYBP and SHQ1 as potential cooperative tumor suppressors. DNA copy-number data from primary tumors revealed that copy-number alterations robustly define clusters of low- and high-risk disease beyond that achieved by Gleason score. The genomic and clinical outcome data from these patients is now made available as a public resource.  Go to: INTRODUCTION Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in males with ~190	000 new cases diagnosed per year in the United States and ~27	000 deaths. Prostate tumors show tremendous biological heterogeneity	 with some patients dying of metastatic disease within 2â€“3 years of diagnosis whereas others can live for 10â€“20 years with organ-confined disease	 likely a reflection of underlying genomic diversity. Large-scale cancer genome characterization projects studying glioblastoma	 lung	 colon	 pancreas and breast cancers have provided critical new insights into the molecular classification of cancers and have the potential to identify new therapeutic targets (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network	 2008; Ding et al.	 2008; Jones et al.	 2008; Parsons et al.	 2008; Sjoblom et al.	 2006; Weir et al.	 2007; Wood et al.	 2007). Prostate cancer presents special challenges for such large-scale multicenter genomics projects because of the relatively small tumor size and admixture with stroma that requires careful pathologist-guided dissection.  A number of groups have reported analyses of transcriptomes and copy-number alterations (CNAs) in prostate cancer	 but rarely from the same samples and typically from modest numbers of tumors (~50â€“100 samples) or with lower resolution platforms (Kim et al.	 2007; Lapointe et al.	 2007; Lapointe et al.	 2004; Lieberfarb et al.	 2003; Perner et al.	 2006; Singh et al.	 2002). Consistent and common findings from these reports include the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion in ~50 percent	 8p loss in ~30â€“50 percent	 and 8q gain in ~20â€“40 percent of cases. The data implicating ERG as a prostate cancer gene is clear (Tomlins et al.	 2005)	 but there has been less progress in defining specific genes targeted by various common amplifications and deletions	 in part due to limited availability of complementary transcriptome and exon resequencing data on sufficient patients to narrow the focus to a small list of candidate genes. Numerous transcriptome studies have defined general prostate cancer signatures but	 unlike breast cancer (Paik et al.	 2004; van de Vijver et al.	 2002)	 these analyses have not identified robust subtypes of prostate cancer with different prognoses (Febbo and Sellers	 2003; Lapointe et al.	 2004; Singh et al.	 2002).  Here we adopted a comprehensive approach to define transcriptomes and CNAs in 218 prostate tumors (181 primaries	 37 metastases) and 12 prostate cancer cell lines and xenografts	 as well as complete exon resequencing and/or focused mutation detection for 157 high interest genes in 80 tumors and 11 cell/xenograft lines (Table 1). After generating a map of CNAs across the dataset	 we used matching mRNA and microRNA transcriptome and exon resequencing data to define the frequency of alterations in several common signal transduction pathways	 explore various candidate genes within a few selected regions of copy-number gain and loss and correlate genomic alterations to clinical outcome. These data serve as a valuable resource for the cancer genomics community	 prostate cancer scientists and clinicians and is readily and freely available through a user-friendly web-based portal (http://cbio.mskcc.org/prostate-portal/).  Table 1 Table 1 Summary of clinical characteristics for the study cohort Go to: RESULTS Global copy number and transcriptome profiles define core pathway alterations  We applied rigorous criteria for selecting tumors for genomic analysis that have become the standard in large genomic studies (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network	 2008) but adapted to address unique challenges posed by prostate cancers. All 218 samples had at least 70% tumor content (Table 1	 Figure S1	 Table S1). Transcriptome (mRNA and microRNA) and CNA profiling were conducted without amplification	 with the exception of exon resequencing	 which required whole genome amplification. Because we did not impose a stringent tumor size requirement	 the small size of some tumors precluded concurrent analysis across all four platforms (Table 2	 Table S2).  Table 2 Table 2 Number of primary and metastatic tumors analyzed by each platform Analysis of known prostate cancer alterations in our dataset indicates successful tumor selection criteria (Figure S1). For example	 the frequency of ERG alteration was 52 percent (see Experimental Procedures)	 consistent with other studies	 and chromosome 8p loss and 8q gain were easily detected (Figure 1A). Overt CNAs were observed in 89 percent of tumors	 also indicative of high tumor content. Additional histologic and molecular analysis of those tumors without CNA confirmed high tumor content (e.g.	 detection of TMPRSS2-ERG translocations). To address the possibility that our stringent tumor selection criteria might bias our dataset toward larger	 more aggressive prostate cancers	 we compared the clinical outcome of the 181 primary tumors (Table S1) in this dataset to 3437 consecutive men with prostate cancer treated by prostatectomy at MSKCC from 2000â€“2006. The time to biochemical relapse	 defined as a rise in serum prostate specific antigen	 was somewhat shorter in this study cohort (Table 1	 Figure S1A). While this indicates that genomic findings from these samples may be biased toward larger	 more aggressive prostate cancers (selected to ensure sufficient nucleic acid yield)	 this cohort nevertheless includes patients with favorable long-term clinical outcome (24% of patients have greater than 5-year recurrence-free survival).  Figure 1 Figure 1 A global view of the prostate cancer genome Global analysis of CNA data from 194 tumors and 12 cell lines/xenografts revealed broad diversity in alteration levels. Metastatic tumors and cell/xenograft lines harbored the greatest number of whole chromosome	 chromosome arm	 and focal amplifications and deletions	 but primary tumors also displayed a wide range of alteration levels	 from tumors appearing metastatic-like in profile to those with fundamentally diploid genomes (Figure S1B). Regions of recurrent CNA were identified using the statistical method RAE (Taylor et al.	 2008)	 revealing 30 focal amplifications and 36 focal deletions as well as recurrent gains and losses of seven chromosome arms (Figure 1A	 Tables S3 and S4). The most frequent alteration in the prostate oncogenome was loss of chromosome 8p	 a common abnormality in many epithelial tumors that harbors NKX3.1 (He et al.	 1997). Interestingly	 NKX3.1 mRNA expression did not correlate with copy-number loss	 suggesting the possibility of alternative tumor suppressors in this region. Consistent with prior studies	 we also found peaks of deletion targeting PTEN on 10q23.31	 RB1 on 13q14.2	 TP53 on 17p31.1 and the interstitial 21q22.2-3 deletion spanning ERG and TMPRSS2. Other broader deletions included 12p13.31-p12.3	 which spans ETV6 and DUSP16 in addition to CDKN1B	 the previously reported target of this genomic deletion (Lapointe et al.	 2007). The most common amplified loci included MYC on 8q24.21 and a previously unreported NCOA2 amplification on 8q13.3 (discussed further below). Focal amplifications of AR (Xq12) were also common but restricted to metastatic tumors. Other gains span discontinuous regions of 7q	 including genes such as BRAF and EZH2	 for which we were unable to localize individual target genes. We observed less frequent gains of 5p13.3-p13.1 spanning AMACR	 RICTOR	 SKP2 as well as 47 other genes and 2 microRNAs.  Eighty tumors were examined for somatic mutations in 138 genes by exon sequencing (Figure 1A	 Tables S5 and S6). These and an additional 76 tumors were also profiled for well-known oncogenic mutations in 22 genes by mass spectrometry using the iPLEX Sequenom assay (Table S5). In total	 84 confirmed somatic mutations were detected in 57 different genes (Table S6). Thirty-seven percent of the missense mutations we detected are predicted to affect protein function (Table S6) based on an algorithm that uses a combination of evolutionary information from protein-family sequence alignments and residue placement in known or homology-deduced three-dimensional protein and complex structures (B. Reva	 et al.	 http://www.mutationassessor.org/). Among all mutated genes	 including those bearing previously known mutations	 the most commonly mutated gene was the androgen receptor (AR)	 with 4 samples	 all metastases. Mutations in 21 other genes were detected in 2 or more samples	 but no single gene other than AR had mutations in more than 3 samples. We also confirmed prior data suggesting that common	 broadly mutated oncogenes such as PIK3CA	 KRAS and BRAF are not commonly mutated in prostate cancer (2 tumors had H1047R and E545K PIK3CA mutations	 2 had G12V and Q61H/L KRAS mutations and one tumor had a BRAF V600E mutation). Mutations in other more recently identified oncogenes such as IDH1 and IDH2 were similarly rare	 with only one tumor bearing an IDH2 R172K mutation. Curiously	 one tumor with a mutation in the mismatch repair gene MSH6 (V250A) had 11 confirmed somatic mutations versus an average of 2 somatic mutations per tumor	 suggestive of a mutator phenotype. Mutations in two other DNA repair genes	 BLM and XPC	 were each found in a single tumor	 but not in association with an increased number of other mutations. Only two tumors had missense mutations in TP53 and none had mutations in PTEN	 but both tumor suppressors were commonly altered through hetero- or homozygous copy-number loss (~24 percent and ~21 percent respectively). Comparison of synonymous and non-synonymous changes detected in these samples suggests a low mutation rate in prostate cancer (~0.31 mutations/Mb). Consistent with this notion	 the frequency of mutations recovered in our analysis did not exceed the expected background rate (Ding et al.	 2008)	 although the modest number of genes and samples sequenced limits this analysis.  We next integrated the CNA	 transcriptome	 and mutation data to conduct a core pathways analysis	 based on the success of this approach in revealing common pathway alterations in glioblastoma (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network	 2008). Three well-known cancer pathways were commonly altered â€“ PI3K	 RAS/RAF and RB â€“ with frequencies ranging from 34 to 43 percent in primary tumors versus 74 to 100 percent in metastases (Figure 1B). In this analysis	 a tumor was considered altered if one or more genes in the pathway was mutated or significantly deregulated at the expression level (outlier expression compared to the distribution of expression in normal prostate samples	 see Experimental Procedures). As in glioblastoma	 the extremely high frequency of alteration in these pathways became evident only through examination of multiple genes in each pathway since individual genes are affected less commonly. Of particular interest is the PI3K pathway	 which was altered in nearly half of primaries and all metastases examined. Loss of PTEN function	 through deletion	 mutation or reduced expression	 has been well documented in prostate cancer with an estimated frequency of ~40 percent (Pourmand et al.	 2007)	 consistent with our findings here. The frequency of PI3K pathway alteration rises substantially when PTEN alterations are considered together with alterations in the INPP4B and PHLPP phosphatases recently implicated in PI3K regulation	 the PIK3CA gene itself	 and the PIK3CA regulatory subunits PIK3R1 and PIK3R3 (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network	 2008; Gao et al.	 2005; Gewinner et al.	 2009; Jaiswal et al.	 2009; Ueki et al.	 2003). These data provide strong rationale for exploring the clinical activity of PI3K pathway inhibitors	 many of which are now in early clinical development	 in prostate cancer.  Common genomic alterations in androgen receptor signaling pathway members  We also conducted a core pathway analysis of AR	 which is essential for growth and differentiation of the normal prostate and is responsible for treatment failure in castration-resistant	 metastatic disease (Chen et al.	 2004; Tran et al.	 2009). As expected	 alteration of AR through mutation	 gene amplification	 and/or overexpression was common but occurred exclusively in metastatic samples (58%	 Figure 2A). However	 AR pathway analysis (including several known AR coactivators and corepressors) revealed alteration in 56 percent of primaries and 100 percent in metastases (Figure 2A	 Figure S2). Among AR pathway genes	 the most striking finding was a peak of copy-number gain on 8q13.3 (~57 megabases away from the peak at 8q24 commonly attributed to MYC	 and of even greater significance) that spans the nuclear receptor coactivator gene NCOA2 (also known as SRC2/TIF2/GRIP1). Seventeen percent of tumors had broad gains of the region spanning NCOA2 on 8q while 6.2% of tumors (1.9% and 24.3% of primary and metastases respectively) harbored focal or high-level amplifications of the locus and these were significantly correlated with elevated NCOA2 transcript levels (p-value < 10âˆ’16	 Figure S2A). In addition to copy number and expression changes	 AR pathway alterations included mutations in NCOA2 (2 confirmed somatic) as well as in NCOR2 (3 tumors)	 NRIP1	 TNK2	 and EP300 (1 tumor each). Overall	 eight percent of primary tumors and 37 percent of metastases had NCOA2 gain of expression (determined to be outlier expression as described in the Experimental Procedures) or mutation (Figure 2Aâ€“B). Including broader gains of 8q	 the frequency of NCOA2 alteration may be as high as 20 and 63 percent in primary and metastatic tumors respectively. Of note	 NCOA2 mutations have also been reported in melanoma and lung cancer and	 in conjunction with the prostate mutations detected here	 cluster in two highly conserved regions. These include a serine/threonine-rich stretch (S/T) known to be phosphorylated and an activation domain (AD1) that mediates binding with histone acetyltransferases such as CBP and p300 (Huang and Cheng	 2004) (Figure 2C). A third patient had an A407S NCOA2 substitution that was potentially germline (detected at low frequency in adjacent normal prostate). Interestingly	 non-castrate patients with primary tumors harboring NCOA2 mutation	 overexpression or high-level amplification had significantly higher rates of recurrence (Figure S2B).  Figure 2 Figure 2 Diversity of androgen signaling pathway alterations in primary and metastatic prostate cancers Taken together	 the high frequency of NCOA2 gain in primary tumors and its known role as an AR coactivator (Agoulnik et al.	 2005) suggest that these two genes might collaborate in early prostate cancer progression by enhancing AR transcriptional output. We addressed this possibility by expressing increasing levels of NCOA2 in prostate cancer cells with a fixed endogenous level of non-amplified AR. The range in NCOA2 protein levels is shown by western blot (Figure 2D) and is similar to the ~2 to 4-fold increase in NCOA2 mRNA levels over the mean level seen in the overall prostate cancer cohort. As expected from other work	 AR transcriptional output (measured using an androgen-responsive reporter construct) was increased when cells were treated with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in a dose-dependent fashion	 but reached a plateau between 1â€“10 ÂµM (Figure 2D). Increasing levels of NCOA2 shifted the DHT dose-response curve leftward and upward	 indicating that NCOA2 can not only prime AR to respond to lower androgen concentrations but can also boost the total magnitude of AR transcriptional output. One prediction from these in vitro data is that the AR transcriptional output in prostate cancers with NCOA2 gene amplification should be greater than those without. Based on a 29-gene signature of AR transcriptional output previously used to conduct small molecule screens for novel antiandrogens (Hieronymus et al.	 2006)	 NCOA2-amplified primary tumors displayed an increase in AR signaling (Figure 2E). Collectively	 the genomic and functional data suggest that NCOA2 functions as a driver oncogene in primary tumors by increasing AR signaling	 which is known to play a critical role in early and late stage prostate cancer. In contrast	 AR amplification	 which is largely restricted to castration-resistant metastatic disease	 is more likely a mechanism of drug resistance rather than a natural step in tumor progression. We also propose that NCOA2 and MYC both function as driver oncogenes on the 8q13 and 8q24 amplicons respectively.  Genetic alterations highly associated with TMPRSS2-ERG  The TMPRSS2-ERG fusion is the single most prevalent molecular lesion in prostate cancer (Tomlins et al.	 2005). Functional studies of TMPRSS2-ERG	 including transgenic expression in the mouse prostate	 have shown modest evidence of oncogenic activity (Carver et al.	 2009; King et al.	 2009; Klezovitch et al.	 2008; Tomlins et al.	 2008)	 which raises the possibility that cooperating events are required.  Analysis of 194 tumors for CNAs associated with TMPRSS2-ERG fusion revealed three significant regions of copy-number loss: two spanning the tumor suppressors PTEN and TP53 and a third spanning the multigenic region at 3p14 (Figure 3A). PTEN loss was recently shown to cooperate with TMPRSS2-ERG in transgenic mice and in a prostate tissue reconstitution model (Carver et al.	 2009; King et al.	 2009; Zong et al.	 2009). The 3p14 deletion	 whose association with TMPRSS2-ERG was even more significant	 has not been previously reported and spans only 8 genes. Further interrogation of 2550 tumors and cell lines spanning 14 tumor types (acute lymphoid leukemia	 breast	 colorectal	 esophageal	 glioma	 hepatocellular	 non-small cell lung	 squamous lung	 medulloblastoma	 melanoma	 myeloproliferative	 ovarian	 renal and prostate) for CNAs in this region suggests this deletion is only found in prostate cancer (Beroukhim et al.	 2010). Indeed	 the only other focal signal found in this region is an amplicon in melanoma that includes microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF)	 a previously reported finding (Garraway et al.	 2005).  Figure 3 Figure 3 TMPRSS2-ERG-associated deletion of 3p14.1-p13 Closer inspection of the 3p14 deletion in our prostate cohort revealed two distinct peaks of association within the region that	 together with expression data and the focal deletion patterns	 implicates only three genes: FOXP1	 RYBP and SHQ1 (Figure 3B	 3C). Deletions in some tumors spanned FOXP1 only	 whereas others included RYBP and SHQ1	 but spared FOXP1. FOXP1 encodes a forkhead box transcription factor and functions in motor neuron specification in the spinal cord	 as well as early thymocyte development	 in collaboration with various HOX genes (Arber	 2008; Pfaff	 2008). A role for FOXP1 in cancer has been proposed based on reduced expression in breast and other cancers	 increased expression in some lymphoid malignancies and	 remarkably	 by translocation-mediated fusion to the ERG homolog ETV1 in at least one prostate cancer (Goatly et al.	 2008; Hermans et al.	 2008; Koon et al.	 2007). Furthermore	 recent evidence implicates the FoxP family member FOXP3 as a potential tumor suppressor in prostate cancer (Wang et al.	 2009). RYBP (Ring and YY1 Binding Protein) encodes a polycomb group transcriptional repressor implicated in homeotic development and	 potentially	 as a tumor suppressor through inhibition of MDM2 and subsequent p53 stabilization (Chen et al.	 2009). SHQ1 encodes an accessory factor for the assembly of H/ACA ribonucleoproteins (RNP) through direct binding to NAP57	 a core RNP subunit. Missense mutations in NAP57 that disrupt interaction with SHQ1 are associated with the bone marrow failure syndrome dyskeratosis congenita	 raising a potential link to precancer syndromes (Grozdanov et al.	 2009).  To gather further evidence for a potential tumor suppressor role of either of these genes	 we searched for point mutations through exon resequencing. We found no mutations in FOXP1 or RYBP	 but detected a confirmed somatic mutation in SHQ1 (P22S) in a highly conserved region of the CS domain that is required for SHQ1 function (Singh et al.	 2009). A second tumor had a deletion targeting the middle of the SHQ1 gene that	 consequently	 resulted in production of an aberrant mRNA species truncated at exon 6 (Figure 3D). Although these data further implicate SHQ1 as a tumor suppressor in this locus	 the fact that some tumors with 3p14 loss spare SHQ1 (Figure 3B) raises the possibility of multiple tumor suppressors in this region.  Unsupervised clustering of CNAs reveals distinct subgroups with differing risk of relapse after prostatectomy  Given the pressing need for biomarkers that distinguish indolent from aggressive prostate cancer	 we also examined the genomic data for prognostic significance. It is estimated that 30â€“50 percent of men diagnosed with prostate cancer could avoid surgery or radiation (and instead be followed by watchful waiting) because they have good-prognosis tumors that are unlikely to progress (Cooperberg et al.	 2005). Whereas transcriptome analysis defines breast cancer subgroups with distinct prognoses and treatment outcomes that have changed clinical practice (Paik et al.	 2004; van de Vijver et al.	 2002)	 similar studies in prostate cancer have been less clinically useful (Mucci et al.	 2008a; Mucci et al.	 2008b). The 5-year median clinical followup linked to this tumor set provided an opportunity to address the prognosis question using various forms of oncogenomic data. While unsupervised hierarchical clustering of mRNA and microRNA data failed to identify robust clusters of patients with significant differences in prognosis	 the CNA data revealed distinct subgroups with substantial differences in time to biochemical (PSA) relapse (Figure 4A	B	 Figure S3Aâ€“C). Further attempts to identify individual genes whose expression has prognostic impact through outlier analysis (~1766 genes with over- or under-expressing outliers relative to normal prostate) were only modestly successful and these associations were weak relative to those observed using the CNA data.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Genomic aberrations identify clinically distinct subtypes of prostate cancer CNA analysis revealed two notable subgroups of primary tumors â€“ those with minimal CNA (clusters 1â€“4) and those with substantial CNA (clusters 5â€“6) that include most of the metastatic samples (Figure 4A). Clusters 5 and 6 are distinguished by the fact that cluster 5 tumors have genome-wide alterations	 whereas those in cluster 6 primarily have 8q (NCOA2	 MYC) or chromosome 7 gains. Among the tumors with minimal CNA	 cluster 2 is characterized by largely unaltered genomes. Using the endpoint of time to biochemical relapse	 primary tumors with generally diploid tumors in the minimally altered cluster 2 had an extremely favorable prognosis versus an extremely unfavorable prognosis for the highly altered cluster 5 tumors (Figure 4B).  We next examined whether the prognostic impact of CNA is simply a reflection of genomic instability or the impact of specific genomic alterations. The fact that the two clusters with the highest prevalence of CNAs (5 and 6) have statistically different outcomes supports the latter hypothesis. To explore this question further	 we systematically examined the impact of gain or loss of whole chromosome arms or more focal regions of gain or loss across the genome. Combined loss of 13q and 18q	 focal amplification of two distinct 5p regions (5p13 or 5p15)	 and focal deletion of 5q21.1 were each significantly associated with a negative outcome (Figure S3B	C)	 further supporting the notion that distinct genomic alterations impact prognosis and raising the possibility that genes in these regions play functional roles in prostate cancer.  These findings raise the possibility that CNA assessment at diagnosis may have clinical utility in distinguishing low- from high-risk disease	 but only if this data adds to the prognostic impact currently provided by the histology-based Gleason score. Poor prognosis Gleason score (>7) tumors were distributed across clusters 2â€“6 (albeit with greatest frequency in cluster 5)	 indicating that histology and CNA are not overlapping (Figure 4C). Furthermore	 low-risk Gleason scores (â‰¤6) were not enriched among clusters 1â€“4. Therefore	 Gleason grade cannot fully explain the association with biochemical relapse. These results raise the possibility of a CNA-based test that might guide treatment choice in men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer	 though this would require validation in a larger independent data set and confirmation that such information can be obtained from biopsies rather than prostatectomy samples. Such a test might be a genome-wide assessment using array-based CGH or multiple inversion probe (MIP) technology (Wang et al.	 2005) or be centered on specific regions of gain or loss identified through further confirmatory studies.  Go to: DISCUSSION The clinical heterogeneity of prostate cancer	 coupled with its high prevalence	 raises challenges in the management of newly diagnosed patients as well as those with metastatic disease. Genomic-based classification offers the hope of more informed clinical decision-making and may yield novel therapeutic targets. Integrated large scale cancer genomics projects in several tumor types have established the utility of this approach for generating the datasets required to derive such classification schema (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network	 2008; Chitale et al.	 2009; Ding et al.	 2008; Jones et al.	 2008; Parsons et al.	 2008; Sjoblom et al.	 2006; Weir et al.	 2007; Wood et al.	 2007). These reports provide definitive overviews of the genomes of those tumor types and in cases such as TCGA provide easy	 web-based access to genomic data that serves as a public resource. The prostate cancer dataset generated here is comparable in size (218 carefully selected	 well-annotated tumors) and scope (transcriptome	 CNA	 exon resequencing) and is linked to clinical outcome. All raw and processed data is freely accessible at http://cbio.mskcc.org/prostate-portal/.  One observation from the exon resequencing data is that somatic point mutations in prostate cancer may be rare relative to other tumor types such as glioblastoma	 lung cancer and melanoma (Greenman et al.	 2007; Pleasance et al.	 2010a; Pleasance et al.	 2010b). With the caveat that only 138 genes were examined (selected primarily based on known roles in other cancers)	 no single gene emerged as commonly mutated. TP53 and PTEN	 which are often cited as prostate cancer tumor suppressors (Dong	 2006; Pourmand et al.	 2007)	 were commonly altered	 but primarily through copy-number loss rather than point mutation. Ongoing comprehensive sequencing studies (whole-genome or whole-exome capture) will provide more insight into the overall mutation rate in prostate cancer.  Several findings have emerged from our analysis	 largely based on the opportunity provided by integrated analysis of multidimensional data. The nuclear receptor coactivator NCOA2 was identified as a highly significant target gene on the 8q13 amplicon and is also subject to mutation in some tumors lacking gene amplification. Functional studies presented here support the hypothesis that increased NCOA2 dosage amplifies AR pathway transcriptional output in primary tumors	 providing a mechanism for its potential role as a prostate cancer oncogene. Whereas AR gene amplification or mutation is generally restricted to metastatic	 castration-resistant disease (acquired in association with treatment resistance)	 CNAs or mutations in NCOA2 and other regulators of nuclear receptor function such as NCOR2 are present in primary tumors	 thereby extending the potential importance of AR pathway perturbation to disease initiation.  A second finding is a narrow deletion on 3p14 highly associated with TMPRSS2-ERG fusion-positive tumors that appears to be present only in prostate cancers. Integrative analysis of copy number	 transcriptome and exon resequencing data implicates three genes within this region (FOXP1	 RYBP and SHQ1) as potential context-specific tumor suppressors	 either alone or in combination. Our methodology also confirmed prior reports of an association of TMPRSS2-ERG with PTEN loss (Han et al.	 2009; Reid et al.	 2010)	 an interaction that has now been validated by in vivo studies in mice (Carver et al.	 2009; King et al.	 2009; Zong et al.	 2009). We found evidence of a possible association with 16q23 deletion previously reported by others (Demichelis et al.	 2009)	 but this did not reach statistical significance in our larger dataset. As has been done with PTEN	 these new associations warrant future functional studies and could define unique ERG-specific tumor suppressor interactions.  These findings together with our analysis showing the high impact of CNA data on risk of relapse relative to transcriptome profiling demonstrate the broad utility of this integrated prostate oncogenome dataset. The high prevalence of this important disease and the relative paucity of large comprehensive genomic datasets in prostate cancer make this a unique public resource for the cancer research community.  Go to: EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Specimen collection and annotation  A total of 218 tumor samples and 149 matched normal samples were obtained from patients treated by radical prostatectomy at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. All patients provided informed consent and samples were procured and the study was conducted under Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Institutional Review Board approval. Clinical and pathologic data were entered and maintained in our prospective prostate cancer database. Following radical prostatectomy	 patients were followed with history	 physical exam	 and serum PSA testing every 3 months for the first year	 6 months for the second year	 and annually thereafter. For all analyses described here	 biochemical recurrence (BCR) was defined as PSA â‰¥ 0.2 ng/ml on two occasions. At the time of data analysis	 patient follow-up was completed through December 2008.  Analyte extraction and microarray hybridization  DNA and RNA were extracted from dissected tissue containing greater than 70% tumor cell content as well as from seven cell lines and seven xenografts (see Supplementary Information). Resulting DNA and RNA were hybridized to Agilent 244K array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) microarrays	 Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST arrays	 and/or Agilent microRNA V2 arrays respectively (Table 2). The normalization and statistical analysis of both DNA copy number and expression array data are available in Supplementary Information.  DNA sequencing  In total	 251 million bases in coding exons and adjacent intronic sequences of 138 cancer-related genes in 91 samples were PCR-amplified and sequenced by Sanger capillary sequencing (Table S5). Ninety-five sites of known mutation in 22 genes were also genotyped using the iPLEX Sequenom platform. The details of whole-genome amplification	 sequencing	 mutation detection pipelines	 mutation validation	 background mutation rate analysis	 and Sequenom genotyping are described in Supplementary Information.  Outlier expression analysis  Outlier profiles for all transcripts and outlier assignments in all tumors were determined from normalized expression data as previously described (Ghosh and Chinnaiyan	 2009). Briefly	 in this nonparametric approach an empirical distribution function generated from transcript expression in the 29 normal prostate tissues was used to transform expression in the tumor samples	 from which outliers were determined with the criteria described in the Benjamini and Hochberg algorithm (Benjamini and Hochberg	 1995) at an error rate (Î±) = 0.01.  TMPRSS2-ERG fusion classification  For the purposes of the association analysis among copy-number alterations (described in detail in Supplementary Information)	 we classified fusion-positive tumors exclusively from aCGH data to maximize our power to detect novel associations in CNA data alone. Tumors were considered fusion-positive if they harbored canonical 21q22.2-3 genomic deletion (D0 or D1 > 0.9 from RAE analysis) with 5â€™ and 3â€™ breakpoints in the coding loci of ERG and TMPRSS2 respectively accompanied by interstitial deletion	 or those samples with micro-deletions at the expected breakpoint sites in either or both genes in conjunction with intergenic diploidy. This approach under-estimates the true frequency of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion by excluding tumors with balanced rearrangement. Therefore	 all other analyses described in this study classified TMPRSS2-ERG status using the subset of cases with both aCGH and expression data. Here	 fusion-positive tumors were those having either the genomic deletion described above or whole-transcript outlier expression inferred from exon expression arrays as described above. We note that re-classification of TMPRSS2-ERG status using individual exon expression adjacent to the expected breakpoints in each coding sequence produced similar results.  Pathway analysis  The details of pathway curation and gene selection for the pathway diagrams are described in the Supplementary Information. To determine pathway alteration frequencies	 gene alterations were defined by up- or down-regulation compared to normal prostate (outlier expression)	 or by somatic non-synonymous mutations. A given tumor was considered altered if at least one gene in the pathway was altered. Mutations in genes known to be frequently deleted or down-regulated were considered as inactivating mutations (shades of blue in the figures)	 while mutations in genes known to be frequently amplified or up-regulated were considered as activating mutations (shades of red). Additionally	 the association of NCOA2 gain-of-function alteration (outlier over-expression or copy-number amplification) with androgen signaling was assessed using a 29-gene signature of androgen stimulation (Hieronymus et al.	 2006). The significance of this association was tested in non-castrate primary tumors by Studentâ€™s t-test.  Hierarchical clustering  Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of discretized copy-number alterations (gain and loss	 A0 and D0 â‰¥ 0.75; otherwise copy-neutral from RAE analysis) assigned to regions of the unified breakpoint profile excluding known CNVs was performed with the Manhattan distance measure and Wardâ€™s linkage.  NCOA2 and AR reporter assay  For NCOA2 assays	 pCDNA3-NCOA2 and PSA-Luc reporter were transfected into LNCaP cells that were androgen-starved (20h) and then assayed for growth after another 20h (One-Glo). Additional experimental details available in Supplementary Information.  Data availability and portal  Study data is deposited in NCBI GEO under accession GSE21032. The analyzed data can also be accessed and explored through the MSKCC Prostate Cancer Genomics Data Portal: http://cbio.mskcc.org/prostate-portal/  Full methods are described in the Supplemental Information.  Highlights  Integrated genomic profiling of 218 prostate tumors provides a unique public resource Androgen receptor coactivator NCOA2 is amplified in primary and metastatic disease TMPRSS2-ERG positive tumors associate with 3p14 loss and candidates FOXP1	 RYBP	 SHQ1 Degree and pattern of CNAs in primary tumors is associated with risk of relapse SIGNIFICANCE  Current knowledge of prostate cancer genomes is largely based on small patient cohorts using single modality platforms. We present an integrated oncogenomic analysis of 218 primary and metastatic prostate cancers as well as 12 cell lines and xenografts. Mutations in known	 commonly mutated oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes such as PIK3CA	 KRAS	 BRAF and TP53 are present but rare. However	 integrative analysis of mutations	 copy-number alterations and expression changes revealed changes in the PI3K	 RAS/RAF and androgen receptor (AR) pathways in nearly all metastatic samples and a high frequency of primary samples. These data clarify the role of several known cancer pathways in prostate cancer	 implicate several new ones	 and provide a blueprint for clinical development of pathway inhibitors.   																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		
2	71||The cyclin-dependent protein kinases	 or cdks	 regulate major cell cycle transitions in eukaryotic cells. A single yeast cdk	 cdc2 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe or CDC28 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae	 can stimulate both the G	/S transition and the G2/M transition when associated with cell cycle-specific cyclins (reviewed in references 51 and 57). In contrast	 a large family of cdc2-related genes in vertebrate cells has been identified and several may be involved in cell cycle regulation (7	15	21	24	 31-33	38	41	45	46	50	52	56	62	66	 72). Distinct cdks from this family are believed to regulate discrete cell cycle transitions in vertebrate cells. Among the human cdk genes	 cdc2	 cdk2	 and cdk3 can complement budding yeast cdc28 mutants	 suggesting that these kinases perform a role analogous to that of the yeast cdk (15	31	45	 50). Vertebrate cdc2 acts at the G2/M transition and is required for entry into mitosis (14	18	59	65	 69). The cdk2 kinase	 in contrast	 has been shown to be essential for the G	/S transition (18	54	67	 69). In addition	 expression of a dominant-negative cdk3 mutant in human cells specifically arrests these cells in GI independently of cdk2 activity	 suggesting that cdk3 activity is also necessary for cell cycle progression (69). Activation of the cdks depends on binding to their regulatory subunits	 the cyclins (14	 63). The cyclins perform cell cycle-specific functions and include cyclins which act at mitosis as well as cyclins which are essential for the GI/S transition (reviewed in reference 61). Several lines of evidence suggest that D-type cyclins are critical regulators of the passage of mammalian somatic cells through GI. Cyclin DI was initially isolated on the basis of three independent properties: rearrangement in parathyroid tumors	 growth factor-dependent expression in macrophages	 and ability to complement mutants of yeast G	 cyclins (37	43	48	 71). When D-type cyclins were identified	 it was therefore postulated that these cyclins would play a role in oncogenesis	 respond to growth factor stimulation	 and stimulate progress through GI. Each of these hypotheses has been substantiated (reviewed in reference 61). In particular	 a role for D-type cyclins in G	 progression has * Corresponding author.

Overexpression of cyclin DI	 D2	 or D3 shortens the G	 phase of the cell cycle in various cell types (3	29	 58)	 while microinjection of antibodies against cyclin Dl or of plasmids expressing antisense cyclin Dl RNA blocks the progression of human fibroblasts through G	 (4	 58). In addition	 overexpression of D-type cyclins can overcome the GI growth arrest by the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene	 RB	 in Saos-2 osteosarcoma cells (16	 25). Finally	 constitutive expression of cyclin D2 or D3 can prevent granulocyte differentiation (29). Association with D-type cyclins has provided indirect evidence for cell cycle regulation by vertebrate cdc2-related kinases other than cdc2	 cdk2	 and cdk3. The cdk4 (previously known as PSK-J3) and cdk5 kinases	 as well as cdc2 and cdk2	 have been shown to associate with D-type cyclins (41	 72-74). The cdk5 kinase has been shown to be an active kinase only in terminally differentiated neurons and is not active in cycling cells (68); this pattern of activity does not suggest that cdk5 acts to promote cell cycle progression. Several experiments suggest that cdk4 is involved in cell cycle regulation. The cdk4 kinase is activated by D-type cyclins upon baculovirus coinfection of insect Sf9 cells	 and the resultant complexes can phosphorylate pRB	 the product of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene (16	28	 41). In addition	 cdk4 protein levels are down-regulated in transforming growth factor beta-blocked mink lung cells	 and constitutive high-level expression of cdk4 in these cells overrides cell cycle arrest by transforming growth factor beta (17). However	 the enzymatic activity of the cellular cdk4 protein or indeed of any cellular complexes containing D-type cyclins has not been described until now (see below and reference 42). We have investigated the cell cycle activity of the product of the human PLSTIRE gene	 the closest homolog of cdk4. The PLSTIRE product shares 71% amino acid sequence identity with cdk4	 defining a distinct subfamily of the cdc2-related kinases (45). We have now shown that the PLSTIRE product associates with cyclins Dl	 D2	 and D3 in human cells. Association of PLSTIRE with D cyclins has also been observed by Bates and colleagues (5). PLSTIRE has therefore been renamed cdk6	 or cyclin-dependent kinase 6. For simplicity	 we use the name cdk6 throughout this paper. Using the product of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene	 pRB	 as a substrate	 we have identified cdk6 kinase 2077 2078 MEYERSON AND HARLOW activity in human cells. First	 we showed that the cdk6 kinase is activated by coexpression with D-type cyclins via recombinant baculoviruses in insect cells. We then demonstrated that endogenous cdk6 exhibits kinase activity when immunoprecipitated from either primary or transformed human cells. In primary T cells which have been stimulated to enter the cell cycle	 cellular cdk6 kinase activity first appears in mid-G1	 prior to the activation of any previously characterized cdk. MATERUILS AND METHODS Cell culture. Tissue culture cells were grown under standard conditions in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For T-lymphocyte preparations	 buffy coats from human blood were obtained from the Massachusetts General Hospital Blood Bank. The mononuclear cell layer was obtained by centrifugation on a FicollHypaque cushion (Ficoll-Paque; Pharmacia). Mononuclear cells were then resuspended at 2 x 106 to 3 x 106 cells per ml in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-activated fetal calf serum and 1 p.g of phytohemagglutinin (PHA) per ml to stimulate T-cell proliferation. Thymidine incorporation was assayed by adding 10 p.Ci of [3H]thymidine to 1 ml of cultured T cells and continuing culture for 1 h. The cells were then lysed with 0.3 N NaOH	 and the lysates were trichloroacetic acid precipitated and counted. Antibodies. For anti-cdk6 antibodies	 a peptide CSQNTS ELNTA	 was synthe sized	 with the underlined residues corresponding to the C terminus of cdk6. The peptide was coupled to activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce) and then injected into rabbits (Pocono Rabbit Farms	 Canadensis	 Pa.). Rabbit antisera were affinity purified by incubation overnight at 4Â°C with the antigenic peptide coupled to activated SulfoLink gel (Pierce) and then by elution with 100 mM glycine (pH 2.5) and neutralization with Tris (pH 8.0). A total of 10 of each eluted fraction was loaded onto polyacrylamide gels	 separated	 and subsequently stained with Coomassie brilliant blue to evaluate the presence of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains. Antibodies were then concentrated by centrifugation through Centricon 10 columns and diluted in phosphatebuffered saline containing 0.05% sodium azide to a final concentration of 0.4 mg/ml. Anti-cyclin Dl monoclonal antibodies (HD11	 HD33	 and HD63) were a gift of L. Zukerberg and E. Lees (75). Polyclonal anti-cyclin D2 and anti-cyclin D3 antibodies	 raised against glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins	 were a gift of K. Ando and J. D. Griffin (1). Monoclonal antibodies to cyclins D2 and D3 were obtained from Pharmingen	 Inc. Anti-cdk4 antibody and peptide were a gift of H. Zhang and D. Beach (73). Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitations. Cells were incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium without methionine for 30 min and then labeled with a 250-	uCi/ml mixture of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium without methionine for 4 h at 37Â°C. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5)	 250 mM NaCl	 5 mM EDTA	 0.5% Nonidet P-40	 50 mM NaF	 0.1 mM Na2 V03	 and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Immunoprecipitations were performed as previously described (22). Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)	 and proteins were visualized by fluorography. For denaturing immunoprecipitations	 cells were lysed in a small volume of 100 mM dithiothreitol-2% SDS-100 mM Tris (pH 6.8) and boiled for 10 min. The samples were then diluted 1:25 in lysis buffer (see above) and immunoprecipitated. Five microliters (2 	ug) of affinity-purified anti-cdk6 antibodies	 2 pu1 of anti-cdk4 antibodies	 3 p.1 of anti-cyclin D2 or anti-cyclin D3 or normal rabbit antibodies	 or 100 p. of hybridoma supernatant were used to immunoprecipitate lysates corresponding to 2.5 ml of cultured cells or any other quantity specified in the text. One microgram of peptide was used to inhibit 2 	ug of anti-cdk6 antibody. This represents an approximately 75-fold molar excess of peptide over antibody recognition sites. To assess the specificity of peptide competition	 a titration	 which showed that most of the cdk6 and associated protein signal was blocked by a 3-fold excess of peptide	 was performed; even a 300-fold excess of peptide failed to eliminate background bands (data not shown). Partial proteolytic mapping. Cells were labeled for immunoprecipitation as described above	 except that 1 mCi of [35S]methionine per ml was used. Samples were immunoprecipitated and then separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Gels were then dried without fixation	 and bands were visualized without fluorography. The bands were then excised and subjected to Staphylococcus aureus V8 partial proteolysis by the method of Cleveland et al. (10). cDNA clones of cdk6 in pBSK-globin (45)	 cyclin Dl in pGEM7 (48)	 cyclin D2 in pBSK (55)	 and cyclin D3 in pGEM7 (49) were linearized	 in vitro transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase	 in vitro translated by using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) and [35S]methionine	 and gel purified. The labeled gene products were then subjected to V8 partial proteolysis as described above. Immunoblotting. For immunoblots from whole-cell lysates	 cell pellets were washed in phosphate-buffered saline	 lysed in 100 mM Tris (pH 6.8)-2% SDS-100 mM dithiothreitol	 sonicated	 and boiled. A total of 60 p.g of each cell lysate was then electrophoresed through a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore). Blots were blocked in 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.2% Tween 20 (TBST) and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with primary antibody. Dilutions of primary antibody were 1:1	500 for affinity-purified anti-cdk6 antiserum	 1:1	000 for anti-cdk4 antiserum	 1:5 for HD11 anti-cyclin Dl hybridoma supernatant	 1:10 for anti-cyclin D2 hybridoma supernatant	 and 1:1	000 for affinity-purified anti-cyclin D3 monoclonal antibody (Pharmingen). The blots were then washed three times for 20 min each wash with TBST	 incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibody (affinity-purified goat antimouse or donkey anti-rabbit antibody [Amersham] at a 1:5	000 dilution in milk-TBST)	 washed	 and developed by using the Amersham ECL chemiluminescence reagent. For immunoprecipitations prior to immunoblotting	 antibodies were covalently cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose beads at a concentration of 2 mg of total immunoglobulin per ml of swollen beads	 using 20 mM dimethyl-pimelimidate in 200 mM borate (pH 9.0). The beads were then washed with 100 mM glycine (pH 2.5) to remove any antibodies that had not been cross-linked. Antibodies used were anti-cdk6 antisera (before affinity purification) with normal rabbit serum as a negative control and anti-cyclin DI monoclonal antibody HD63 with M73	 a monoclonal antibody to adenovirus ElA (22)	 as a negative control. A total of 100 p.1 of beads was used for 500 p.g of cell lysate. After immunoprecipitation	 samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). Blots were probed as described above. Baculovirus infections. Coding sequences of cdk4 (21) and cdk6 (45) were subcloned from pCMV plasmids (69) into the MOL. CELL. BIOL. G1 KINASE ACTIVITY OF cdk6	 A CYCLIN D PARTNER 2079 BamHI sites of pVL1393 (Pharmingen	 Inc.). Recombinant Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis viruses were then produced by using the BaculoGold transfection system (Pharmingen	 Inc.) and subsequently amplified. Cyclin D1	 D2	 and D3 baculoviruses were a gift of Stefan Gruenwald (Pharmingen). Wild-type A. californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (Pharmingen) was used as the baculovirus vector control. A total of 5 x 106 Sf9 cells were infected with 0.5 ml of each tested baculovirus supernatant at approximate titers of 108 PFU/ml. Cells were harvested 48 h postinfection. Expression of the protein products was confirmed by immunoblotting. Kinase assays. Sf9 cell cultures were split in half. One half was lysed by sonication in 200 RI of kinase buffer (50 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid [HEPES	 pH 7.0]	 10 mM MgCl2	 5 mM MnCl2	 1 mM dithiothreitol); 25 [lI of this lysate was then used for kinase assays. The other half was lysed and immunoprecipitated as described above under "Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitations." Immunoprecipitations were washed once in kinase buffer prior to kinase assays. Immunoprecipitations from human cells were performed as described above and then washed in kinase buffer before being assayed. Samples for kinase assay were incubated for 30 min at 37Â°C in a final volume of 50 	ul of kinase buffer containing 10 	uM ATP	 0.4 mCi of [-y-32P]ATP per ml	40	ug of substrate protein per ml	 and	 in some experiments	 100 jig of competitor protein (bovine serum albumin or GST). The phosphorylated proteins were then electrophoresed on denaturing polyacrylamide gels; the gels were stained with Coomassie blue prior to autoradiography to permit ready excision and scintillation counting of the phosphorylated substrates. RESULTS cdk6 forms cellular complexes with cyclins Dl	 D2	 and D3. To characterize the activities of the cdk6 protein	 polyclonal antisera were generated by immunizing rabbits with a peptide corresponding to the carboxy-terminal 10 amino acids of the predicted cdk6 gene product. These anti-cdk6 antisera were then affinity purified by using the C-terminal peptide immunogen. The anti-cdk6 antisera immunoprecipitated two prominent protein bands with apparent molecular masses of 40 and 34 kDa from [35S]methionine-labeled myeloid leukemia ML-1 cells under mild	 nondenaturing conditions (Fig. 1A	 lane 1). These molecules were not precipitated when the antisera were preincubated with an excess of the immunizing peptide as competitor (Fig. 1A	 lane 2). Several additional protein bands of lesser intensity were likewise abolished by the peptide. To establish which protein was directly recognized by the anti-cdk6 antibody and thus might correspond to cdk6	 we lysed and boiled ML-1 cells in a denaturing buffer prior to immunoprecipitation. Under these conditions	 only the 40-kDa protein was recognized by the anti-cdk6 antisera (Fig. 1A	 lane 3). Binding of the antisera to this protein was again abolished by competition with the peptide (Fig. 1A	 lane 4). The 40-kDa protein from anti-cdk6 immunoprecipitates comigrated with in vitro-translated cdk6 mRNA (not shown). We were able to confirm the identity of the 40-kDa protein recognized by anti-cdk6 antisera with the in vitro-translated product of the cdk6 gene by partial proteolytic mapping with V8 protease (Fig. 1B). Thus	 the 40-kDa protein recognized by anti-cdk6 antisera was identified as the cellular cdk6 protein.

(B) V8 partial proteolytic digestion of 35S-labeled cdk6 proteins. In vitro-translated cdk6 (IVT; lanes 1 to 3) was compared with the 40-kDa band from an anti-cdk6 immunoprecipitation (IP; lanes 4 to 6). V8 protease was added at 50 ng (lanes 1 and 4)	 500 ng (lanes 2 and 5)	 or 5	000 ng (lanes 3 and 6) per lane. Figures were prepared electronically with a LaCie Silverscan scanner and the Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop programs. denaturing conditions might be a cyclin subunit. In light of their known association with cdk4 (41	 72)	 D-type cyclins were good candidates for cdk6-associated proteins in the 35-kDa range. Therefore	 we compared the cdk6-associated protein of ML-1 cells with the known D-type cyclins. The 34-kDa protein coprecipitated by anti-cdk6 antibodies from ML-1 lysates (Fig. 2A	 lane 1) migrated at the same velocity as cellular cyclin D3 precipitated with anti-cyclin D3 antibody (Fig. 2A	 lane 5). No cyclin Dl or D2 was detected by immunoprecipitation from ML-1 cells (Fig. 2A	 lanes 3 and 4). Partial proteolytic digestion with V8 protease showed that the 34-kDa protein from an anti-cdk6 immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2B	 lanes 1 to 3) was indistinguishable from cellular cyclin D3 (Fig. 2B	 lanes 4 to 6) and very similar to in vitro-translated cyclin D3 (not shown). Thus	 the prominent band in anti-cdk6 immunoprecipitates from ML-1 cells is cyclin D3. Since the anti-cdk6 antibodies failed to recognize cyclin D3 in denatured form (Fig. IA)	 we infer that cdk6 and cyclin D3 form heterodimers in ML-1 cells. Although anti-cyclin D3 antibodies did not coprecipitate significant amounts of labeled cdk6 from lysates of ML-1 cells labeled for 30 min (Fig. 2A	 lane 5)	 cdk6 could be detected in anti-cyclin D3 immunoprecipitates when ML-1 cells were labeled for 4 or 6 h (not shown). These data suggest that cyclin D3 turns over more rapidly than cdk6 and/or that cdk6 is in excess over cyclin D3 in ML-1 cells. We wondered whether other D cyclins might also be associated with cdk6 in the cells that expressed the other D cyclins. To identify cell-specific expression patterns	 we immunoblotted lysates from a panel of human cells and probed them with antibodies to cyclins Dl	 D2	 and D3 as well as to cdk6 and VOL. 14	 1994 ..*	 W* .0 Adk	.dM -	j!t 4*.- .4.w 2080 MEYERSON AND HARLOW A -T c	 m .2 au0 aJ 0- CI cn	L 2\ CO (Dc CD *C	C_ n -a e-a >3 o S o o o n Hv aa ca u a -200K anti- anticdk6 cyclin D3 I [1 38K - 34K- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 B _ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 C 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 D 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 FIG. 2.

The cdk6 and cdk4 proteins are differentially expressed in distinct cell types (Fig. 3A and B)	 as had been found for the corresponding mRNAs (45). The cdk6 protein was most abundant in ML-1 cells (Fig. 3A)	 consistent with the elevated mRNA expression seen in this cell line (45). Similarly	 D cyclins were expressed in a cell-type-specific manner (Fig. 3C to E)	 as had been previously described (1	30	43	55	 70). Cells which expressed the highest levels of a given D-type cyclin were chosen to study cdk6 association with this specific cyclin. Primary human peripheral blood T lymphocytes were selected to assess the association of cdk6 with cyclin D2. Anticdk6 antibodies precipitated the 40-kDa cdk6 protein as well as proteins of 35 and 34 kDa from labeled T cells (Fig. 4A	 lane 1); these protein bands were abolished by competitor peptide (Fig. 4A	 lane 2). The 35-kDa band comigrated with cellular cyclin D2 (Fig. 4A	 lane 4)	 while the 34-kDa band comigrated with cellular cyclin D3 (Fig. 4A	 lane 5). Partial proteolytic mapping with V8 protease showed that the 35-kDa protein from anti-cdk6 immunoprecipitates is cyclin D2 (Fig. 4B). The 34-kDa protein in anti-cdk6 immunoprecipitates was likewise confirmed to be cyclin D3 by proteolytic mapping (not shown).

The immunoblots were then probed with affinitypurified anti-cdk6 antisera (A)	 anti-cdk4 antisera (B)	 anti-cyclin Dl monoclonal antibody HD11 (C)	 anti-cyclin D2 monoclonal antibody (D)	 and anti-cyclin D3 monoclonal antibody (E). at 50 to 55 kDa	 also seen in WI-38 cells (Fig. 5A	 lane 2)	 which has not been reproducible	 and two bands in the 20- to 25-kDa range	 one of which may correspond to the previously characterized p21 protein associated with cyclins and cdks (72-74). Cellular complexes of cdk6 with cyclin Dl in WI-38 cells were identified. Anti-cdk6 antibodies precipitated the 40-kDa cdk6 protein as well as a 36-kDa cellular protein from lysates of WI-38 cells (Fig. SA	 lane 2). The 36-kDa protein comigrated with cyclin D1; in addition	 anti-cyclin Dl antibodies coprecipitated a 40-kDa protein from WI-38 cells which comigrated with cdk6 (Fig. SA	 lane 4). The pattern produced by partial V8 digestion of the 36-kDa band in the anti-cdk6 immunoprecipitation was indistinguishable from the patterns produced by digestion of either in vitro-translated cyclin Dl or cyclin Dl immunoprecipitated with anti-cyclin Dl monoclonal antibodies (Fig. SB).

(B) V8 partial proteolytic digestion of 35S-labeled cyclin D2 proteins. In vitro-translated (IVT) cyclin D2 (lanes 1 to 3) was compared with the 35-kDa band from an anti-cdk6 immunoprecipitation (lanes 4 to 6) and cellular cyclin D2 from an anti-cyclin D2 immunoprecipitation (lanes 7 to 9). A total of 50 ng (lanes 1	4	 and 7)	 500 ng (lanes 2	5	 and 8)	 or 5	000 ng (lanes 3	6	 and 9) of V8 protease was used for digestion. cyclin Di was confirmed further by reciprocal immunoprecipitations and immunoblots (Fig. SC). The above data show that cdk6 is associated with cyclins Dl	 D2	 and D3 in cells which express the given cyclin together with cdk6. Reconstituted and endogenous cdk6 immune complexes are active as pRB kinases. When a cdk-cyclin complex is identified	 it is important to determine whether the complex exhibits kinase activity	 and if so	 which substrates it can phosphorylate. Coinfection of insect Sf9 cells with recombinant baculoviruses has shown that cdk4 is activated as a kinase by D-type cyclins (16	28	 41). However	 immunoprecipitation of this reconstituted kinase activity or of endogenous cellular kinase activity has not been reported for cdk4 or for D-type cyclins. First	 we wanted to determine whether the coexpression of cdk6 with D-type cyclins in Sf9 cells gave rise to kinase activity. Sf9 cells were coinfected with baculoviruses encoding cdks or vector controls together with baculoviruses encoding D-type cyclins or vector controls. Kinase assays were then performed on crude lysates of these Sf9 cells. A number of substrates were tried for these assays; among these	 only fusion proteins with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene product	 pRB	 were good substrates for cdk6. For these experiments	 the chosen substrate was a fusion protein between GST and amino acids 792 to 928 from the C terminus of pRB	 GST-RB-Cterm (19); GST-RB60 containing amino acids 379 to 928 from pRB (27) was also a suitable substrate	 while GST alone was not phosphorylated (not shown). D-type cyclins activated both cdk6 and cdk4 (used as positive control) in Sf9 coinfection experiments. Lysates from cells which coexpressed cyclin Di with cdk4 (Fig. 6A	 lane 4) or with cdk6 (Fig. 6A	 lane 6) exhibited pRB kinase activity; no activity was seen in cells infected with vector control	 cyclin Di	 cdk4	 or cdk6 alone. The significance of the higher level of kinase activity seen with cdk6 is unclear. The increased activity may be due to the relative amounts of protein expressed in the baculovirus-infected cells	 as expression levels were assayed only by immunoblotting and were not strictly controlled. Cyclin D2 and cyclin D3 were also able to activate both cdk4 and cdk6 kinase activity (not shown). The ability of other cyclins to activate cdk6 has not yet been tested. When lysates of baculovirus-infected cells were immunoprecipitated and then assayed for kinase activity	 affinity-purified anti-cdk6 antisera were able to precipitate the pRB kinase activity from cells coinfected with cdk6 and cyclin Di baculoviruses (Fig. 6B	 lane 8) but not from cells expressing cdk4 and cyclin Dl (Fig. 6B	 lane 4). Anti-cdk6 antibodies also recognized the kinase activity produced by coexpression of cdk6 with cyclins D2 and D3 (not shown). This shows that the cdk6-D cyclin complexes can directly phosphorylate the pRB protein and that the antibodies do not interfere with kinase activity. In contrast	 anti-cdk4 antibodies did not precipitate high levels of kinase activity from cells coexpressing cdk4 with cyclin Di (Fig. 6B	 lane 2)	 although weak activity was seen on a longer exposure (not shown). The different abilities of anti-cdk4 and anti-cdk6 antibodies to precipitate active kinase in these experiments may be due to the probably higher titer of the affinity-purified anti-cdk6 antibody or to the detergent conditions required for precipitating active complexes of cdk4 and D-type cyclins (42). To test whether endogenous cdk6 protein complexes from human cells also exhibited kinase activity	 lysates of ML-1 cells and primary T cells were precipitated with anti-cdk6 antibodies or with anti-cdk2 antibodies as a positive control. The immune complexes were then assayed for the ability to phosphorylate both GST-RB-Cterm and histone HI. When GST-RB-Cterm was used as a substrate	 anti-cdk6 immunoprecipitations from lysates of both ML-1 cells (Fig. 7A	 lane 1) and T cells (Fig. 7A	 lane 5) exhibited significant kinase activity. In contrast	 cdk6 did not appear to phosphorylate histone Hi appreciably. The pRB phosphorylation by cdk6 immune complexes was abolished by preincubating the antibodies with competitor peptide (Fig. 7A	 lanes 2 and 6). In contrast	 anti-cdk2 immunoprecipitations phosphorylated both GST-RB-Cterm and histone HI (Fig. 7A	 lanes 3 and 7). The above results suggest that the cellular cdk6 kinase exhibits substrate specificity	 preferring pRB to histone Hi as a substrate. Similar specificity has been reported for cdk4 kinase reconstituted in insect cells (41). To confirm the preference of cellular cdk6 kinase for pRB	 the Coomassie bluestained bands containing the 2.5 	ug of GST-RB-Cterm and of histone Hi used as a substrate for the kinase reactions were excised and counted. The counts were corrected by subtracting the values for the peptide competition lanes	 and the ratio of pRB to histone HI phosphorylation was then determined. In both ML-1 cells and T cells	 cdk6 exhibited a greater preference for pRB phosphorylation than did cdk2 (Fig. 7B)	 suggesting that these two kinases exhibit distinct substrate specificities. In summary	 we have shown that cdk6 kinase activity is activated by D cyclins in Sf9 insect cells. Furthermore	 endogenous cdk6 immune complexes from lysates of both primary VOL. 14	 1994 2082 MEYERSON AND HARLOW B IVT anticyclin Dl cyclin Dl 11 I I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 FIG. 5.

A total of 50 ng (lanes 1	4	 and 7)	 500 ng (lanes 2	5	 and 8)	 or 5	000 ng (lanes 3	6	 and 9) of V8 protease was used for digestion. (C) Immunoprecipitation and immunoblots. Anti-cdk6 (lane 1) and normal (nl) rabbit (lane 2) immunoprecipitates from 1 mg of cell lysate and 20 p.g of whole-cell extract (WCE; lane 3) were blotted and probed with anti-cyclin D1 monoclonal antibody HD11 (lanes 1 to 3). Immunoprecipitations from 1 mg of cell lysate with the anti-cyclin Dl monoclonal antibody HD33 (lane 4) and with the control anti-ElA monoclonal antibody M73 (lane 5) were probed with anti-cdk6 antisera (lanes 4 and 5). and transformed human cells exhibit significant kinase activity	 phosphorylating pRB as a candidate substrate. D-cyclin association and kinase activation of cdk6 occur during G1 in activated T cells. When peripheral blood mononuclear cells are treated with PHA	 the T lymphocytes progress from a resting state into the cell cycle in roughly synchronous fashion. Human T lymphocytes prepared in this fashion expressed significant levels of both cdk6 and cyclin D2 (Fig. 3). In these T cells	 cdk6 was associated with both cyclin D2 and cyclin D3 (Fig. 4)	 and cdk6 immune complexes from T cells could phosphorylate pRB (Fig. 7). Finally	 levels of cdk6 in these T cells were significantly higher than cdk4 levels	 as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation (not shown) and immunoblotting (Fig. 3). Therefore	 PHA-stimulated T cells were chosen as a model system to study the cell cycle regulation of cdk6 association with cyclins and cdk6 kinase activity. In the experiment whose results are shown in Fig. 8	 the T lymphocytes underwent blastogenesis between 4 and 8 h after PHA stimulation	 as displayed by the appearance of clusters of enlarged cells. The T cells began to enter S phase at the 31-h time point	 as shown by thymidine incorporation (Fig. 8A). When the same cell populations were analyzed by flow cytometry	 a significant fraction of S-phase cells was first observed at 36 h	 and GJM cells were first detected at 48 h. The cells did not appear to be highly synchronous at later time points	 whether they were analyzed by thymidine incorporation (Fig. 8A) or by flow cytometry. The association of cyclins D2 and D3 with cdk6 occurs during G1. When stimulated T cells from various time points were labeled with [35S]methionine	 lysed	 and then immunoprecipitated with anti-cdk6 antibodies	 cdk6 could be visualized as soon as 5 h after PHA stimulation (Fig. 8B). At this 5-h time point	 cdk6 was complexed with cyclin D2. Subsequently	 at 16 to 20 h	 prior to the onset of DNA synthesis	 cdk6 was also associated with cyclin D3 (Fig. 8B). The timing of cyclin D2 and cyclin D3 association with cdk6 is consistent with the previously reported pattern of synthesis of these cyclins in activated T cells (1). Using pRB as a substrate	 we were able to detect cdk6 kinase activity beginning 12 to 16 h after PHA stimulation (Fig. 8C). The cdk6 kinase activity reached a peak at 36 h as cells were continuing to enter S phase and then persisted throughout the stimulation experiment. In contrast	 cdk2 kinase activity did not appear until 31 h after PHA stimulation	 coincident with the onset of DNA synthesis (Fig. 8D). This is consistent with previous reports that cdk2 is activated at or just prior to the G1/S transition (53	60	 67). Finally	 in addition to the D cyclins	 a 28-kDa protein	 p28	 first appeared in anti-cdk6 immunoprecipitates at 12 h after PHA stimulation (Fig. 8B). Strikingly	 p28 was present in cdk6 immune complexes for only a discrete window of time and disappeared by 58 h after PHA addition. It is unlikely that p28 is responsible for cdk6 kinase activity	 since the p28 band was not detectable at later time points	 when cdk6 kinase activity persisted.

(B) Immunoprecipitations were performed from Sf9 cells with the indicated antibodies. The resulting immune complexes were assayed for kinase activity towards GST-RB-Cterm. immunoprecipitates from cycling cells	 and its identity is unknown. In summary	 cdk6 is activated as a pRB kinase during the G	 phase of PHA-stimulated T cells	 prior to the activation of cdk2. Our data suggest that the complex of cdk6 with D cyclins is responsible for this G	#NAME?	 the cdk6 kinase can phosphorylate pRB near the time when pRB phosphorylation is initiated in T cells (11) and is thus a good candidate for the initial pRB kinase. The missing piece of the puzzle for understanding D-type cyclin function has been the absence of identified kinase activity associated with D cyclins or their catalytic partners in mammalian cells. In consequence	 a variety of alternative hypotheses has been generated. These include the suggestion that cellular D-type cyclins fail to activate cdks because of an associated inhibitor of kinase activity and the proposal that D cyclins exert their activity by retaining other proteins in the nucleus. We have now demonstrated an endogenous human kinase activity associated with cdk6	 a D-type cyclin partner. This kinase activity is initiated during GI	 well prior to the onset of DNA synthesis	 and shows specificity for pRB relative to histone HI. While we have not yet definitively proven the dependence of cellular cdk6 kinase activity upon association with D-type cyclins	 the following evidence strongly suggests that this is the case. First	 coexpression of D cyclins with cdk6 in Sf9 cells is required to activate cdk6 kinase. Second	 D-type cyclins are the only proteins found in stoichiometric ratios in the anti-cdk6 immunoprecipitates. Finally	 preclearing with anti-cyclin D antibodies eliminates the majority of cdk6 kinase activity (44). Thus	 while it remains a formal possibility that cdk6 kinase activity in human cells is activated by a molecule other than a D-type cyclin	 D-type cyclins are likely to be the positive regulatory subunits. Previous difficulties in detecting mammalian cell kinase activity associated with D-type cyclins now appear to be technical. Matsushime and colleagues have independently identified a pRB kinase activity specifically associated with anti-D-type cyclin immunoprecipitates (42). The catalytic subunit for this D-cyclin-dependent kinase activity	 identified in macrophages and fibroblasts	 is cdk4	 while cdk6-cyclin D kinase activity	 in contrast	 is most prominent in lymphocytes. Although the identification of kinase activity for D-type cyclins associated with cdk6 and with cdk4 does not rule out alternative models for cyclin D function as discussed above	 it strongly suggests that D-type cyclins are likely to regulate cell cycle progression by activating the cdk6 and cdk4 kinases. The ability of endogenous human cdk6 to phosphorylate pRB raises the question of whether cdk6 may regulate pRB function in vivo. Phosphorylation of pRB appears to be an important element in cell cycle control by this tumor suppressor protein. The pRB protein is unphosphorylated in G1	 becomes phosphorylated prior to the GI/S transition	 and is then dephosphorylated during mitosis (6	9	12	 47). Phosphorylation of pRB is believed to down-regulate its growth-inhibitory activities (8	23	 40). Thus	 the kinases that phosphorylate pRB are likely to be growth-promoting elements. cD > ci C0 (D -; -o C.)

The immune complexes were then incubated in kinase buffer containing [y-32P]ATP	 histone Hi	 and GST-RB-Cterm to assess kinase activity. (B) Substrate preference of cdk6. GST-RB-Cterm and histone HI bands were excised from immune complex kinase assay gels and counted. Counts for each kinase were corrected by subtracting the values for peptide competitor lanes. Ratios were obtained by dividing the counts per minute for GST-RB-Cterm by those for histone HI. A cdc2 family kinase or a close relative is likely to be the physiological pRB kinase. Both human cdc2 and cdk2 can phosphorylate pRB at sites corresponding to the sites phosphorylated in vivo (2	35	36	39	 64) and are physically associated with pRB	 albeit in small quantities (26	 34). However	 in T cells	 the timing for cdc2 and cdk2 kinase activation follows the initial phosphorylation of pRB (11	 20) (Fig. 8D). The recent observation that cdk4 coexpression with D cyclins in insect cells gives rise to a pRB kinase (16	28	 41) and the reports of physical interactions between D cyclins and pRB (13	16	 28) suggest that D cyclins and their partners might also regulate pRB function. Our data now demonstrate cell cycle-dependent cdk6 kinase activity towards pRB. The onset of this kinase activity coincides with the timing of the first wave of pRB phosphorylation in T cells (11).

1	72||The Mre11 complex	 composed of RAD50	 NBS1 and MRE11	 has an essential role in the maintenance of genomic integrity and preventing cells from malignancy. Here we report the association of three Mre11 complex mutations with hereditary breast cancer susceptibility	 studied by using a caseâ€“control design with 317 consecutive	 newly diagnosed Northern Finnish breast cancer patients and 1000 geographically matched healthy controls (P = 0.0004). RAD50 687delT displayed significantly elevated frequency in the studied patients (8 out of 317	 OR 4.3	 95% CI 1.5â€“12.5	 P= 0.008)	 which indicates that it is a relatively common low-penetrance risk allele in this cohort. Haplotype analysis and the screening of altogether 512 additional breast cancer cases from Sweden	 Norway and Iceland suggest that RAD50 687delT is a Finnish founder mutation	 not present in the other Nordic cohorts. The RAD50 IVS3-1G>A splicing mutation leading to translational frameshift was observed in one patient	 and the NBS1 Leu150Phe missense mutation affecting a conserved residue in the functionally important BRCA1 carboxy-terminal (BRCT) domain in two patients	 both being absent from 1000 controls. Microsatellite marker analysis showed that loss of the wild-type allele was not involved in the tumorigenesis in any of the studied mutation carriers	 but they all showed increased genomic instability assessed by cytogenetic analysis of peripheral blood T-lymphocytes (P = 0.006). In particular	 the total number of chromosomal rearrangements was significantly increased (P = 0.002). These findings suggest an effect for RAD50 and NBS1 haploinsufficiency on genomic integrity and susceptibility to cancer.  Go to: Introduction RAD50 is a highly conserved DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair factor. Together with NBS1 and MRE11 it composes the Mre11 complex with functions in sensing and early processing of DSB	 cell cycle checkpoints	 DNA recombination and maintenance of telomeres (1â€“3). This protein complex integrates DNA repair with checkpoint signaling through the ATM kinase	 acting both upstream and downstream of ATM in the DNA damage response pathway (4â€“7). Even minor disturbances of Mre11 complex activity have profound effects on the genomic integrity	 and all three components have been implicated in recessive genetic instability disorders. Hypomorphic mutations in MRE11 and NBS1 result in ataxia-telangiectasia like disorder (ATLD) and Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS)	 respectively (8	9)	 and recently mutations in RAD50 have also been described in a patient with NBS phenotype (T. DÃ¶rk	 personal communication). While no cancer predisposition has been reported in ATLD (10	11)	 NBS patients are cancer-prone	 particularly to lymphomas. In addition	 heterozygous NBS carriers have been suggested to have an increased cancer risk	 and germline alterations in NBS1 have been shown to associate with a variety of malignancies	 including leukemia	 malignant melanoma	 prostate	 breast and ovarian cancer (12â€“16).  On the basis of the central role of the Mre11 complex in the maintenance of genomic integrity	 151 breast and/or ovarian cancer families were previously screened for germline mutations in the entire coding regions of the RAD50	 NBS1 and MRE11 genes (17). Two novel	 potentially breast cancer-associated mutations were identified: RAD50 687delT leading to frameshift with premature translation stop at codon 234 was observed in two families	 and NBS1 Leu150Phe affecting an evolutionarily conserved residue in the middle of the functionally important BRCA1 carboxy-terminal (BRCT) domain was observed in one family. In addition	 two other novel RAD50 alterations	 Ile94Leu and Arg224His classified as unknown variants	 were observed. This prompted us to evaluate the overall significance of these alterations in breast cancer susceptibility by studying a second breast cancer cohort. Here we report the prevalence of these alleles	 and a novel RAD50 truncation allele	 in an unselected cohort of 317 consecutive	 newly diagnosed breast cancer cases and 1000 healthy population controls. For the further evaluation of the geographical occurrence of RAD50 687delT	 altogether 512 additional breast cancer patients from Sweden	 Norway and Iceland were screened for this mutation. We also provide evidence for a pathogenic effect of the three Mre11 complex alterations on genomic instability assessed by cytogenetic analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes.  Go to: Material and methods Subjects  An unselected cohort of 317 breast cancer patients were screened for RAD50 687delT	 RAD50 Ile94Leu	 RAD50 Arg224His and NBS1 Leu150Phe alterations. DNA samples were isolated from blood lymphocytes of patients operated at the Oulu University Hospital from April 2000 through July 2004. The diagnoses were pathologically confirmed. The mean age at cancer diagnosis was 58 years (ages varied between 29 and 95). A written informed consent was obtained from all patients	 who also filled out a questionnaire concerning breast	 ovarian and other cancer prevalence in their family. Only patients reporting breast and/or ovarian cancer in first- or second-degree relatives were considered to be familial cases. The healthy control group (N = 1000) used as reference was collected from May through July 2002 and constituted of anonymous cancer-free Finnish Red Cross blood donors originating from the same geographical region as the studied patients (17). The mean age of the controls was 41 years (ages varied between 18 and 66).  The blood samples of the patients identified in Oulu selected for chromosomal analysis were collected at least 2 years after the initial breast cancer diagnosis. These patients filled out a questionnaire concerning cancer treatment received and other possible chronic diseases	 to exclude those where recent or ongoing radio- and/or chemotherapy	 or other medication might have influence on peripheral lymphocyte chromosomal stability. Seven of the eight cases had received radiotherapy and the time from last treatment to sample collection for chromosomal analysis was for one patient 9 months	 and for the rest 2â€“4 years. Three patients had also received chemotherapy; the time from last treatment was for two cases 2 years and for one case 1 year. The controls used in chromosomal analysis were healthy	 age-matched female individuals.  To evaluate the geographical prevalence of RAD50 687delT	 additional breast cancer cohorts from Sweden (Lund	 130 cases)	 Norway (Oslo	 136 cases) and Iceland (Reykjavik	 246 cases) were screened for this mutation.  Approval for the study was obtained from the Ethical Boards of the involved University Hospital health care districts.  Mutation screening  Conformation sensitive gel electrophoresis (18) was used for mutation detection. All findings were confirmed by sequencing with the Li-Cor IR2 4200-S DNA Analysis system (Li-Cor	 Lincoln	 NE). The following primers were used: for RAD50 687delT and Arg224His in exon 5	 forward 5â€²-GTGACAGCATAATATCCCACTG-3â€²	 reverse 5â€²-TTGATTTAGCCAG-TCCACGA-3â€²; for RAD50 Ile94Leu in exon 3	 forward 5â€²-TGCCTTTTTCTCAGAACCAAC-3â€²	 reverse 5â€²-GAAAACAACCAT-CAACTTACAGACC-3â€²; for NBS1 Leu150Phe in exon 4	 forward 5â€²-AGTTTTAAAGTACTAAAAATTGCCATC-3â€²	 reverse 5â€²-ACAAAGG-GATGGAGTGGGTA-3â€².  Statistical analysis  Fisherâ€™s exact test was used to evaluate the differences in allele frequencies between cases and controls. Independent samples t-test for normally distributed variables and Mannâ€“Whitney U-test for non-normally distributed variables was used to determine the statistical difference in the number of different chromosomal aberrations between the two groups categorized according to their genetic status. Comparisons were done with SPSS (version 12.0 for Windows	 SPSS	 Chicago	 IL)	 and all P values were two-sided.  Evaluation of RAD50 IVS3-1G>A effect on mRNA splicing  Lymphoblast cell lines were established from two carriers (BR-0516	 BR-0490) of a novel RAD50 IVS3-1G>A mutation identified during screening for the Ile94Leu alteration	 and two non-carriers. Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum	 1% L-glutamine and gentamycin (10 Î¼g/ml) at 37Â°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. mRNA was isolated with the FastTrackÂ® 2.0 Kit (Invitrogen	 Carlsbad	 CA) and cDNA was synthesized using the RevertAidâ„¢ First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas	 Hanover	 MD). The effect of RAD50 IVS3-1G>A on splicing was estimated by cDNA-specific amplification of a 488 bp fragment with following primers: forward 5â€²-AATTTTGGTTGGACCCAATG-3â€² (exon 1)	 reverse 5â€²-CCTGCCGAAGTGTTTCTAAGG-3â€² (exon 5). The presence of incorrectly spliced transcripts was evaluated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel and sequencing.  Microsatellite marker analysis  DNA markers D5S2057	 D5S1984 and D5S2002 were used for haplotype analysis of RAD50 687delT carriers	 and to analyze allelic imbalance (AI) in the available tumors of RAD50 687delT and RAD50 IVS3-1G>A carriers. Markers D8S1800	 D8S88	 D8S1811 and D8S1724 were used for the corresponding analyses of NBS1 Leu150Phe carriers. Normal and tumor DNA were extracted from paraffin-embedded tissues (19). The PCR products were analyzed with the Li-Cor using an IRD800-labelled forward primer	 and allele intensity ratios were quantified with the Gene Profiler 4.05 analysis program (Scanalytics	 Fairfax	 VA). AI was calculated from the formula AI = (T2 Ã— N1)/(T1 Ã— N2)	 where T1/2 represents tumor and N1/2 the corresponding normal alleles. A value > 1.67 or < 0.60 was considered to indicate AI	 meaning that the intensity of one allele had decreased >40% (20).  Cytogenetic analyses  The cytogenetic analysis of peripheral blood T-lymphocytes of RAD50 687delT	 RAD50 IVS3-1G>A	 NBS1 Leu150Phe carriers	 and mutation-negative	 age-matched healthy controls was carried out in short-term cultures (21). A minimum of 50 Giemsa-banded metaphases were evaluated for spontaneous chromosomal abnormalities by light microscopy and photographed with an automatic chromosome analyser (CytoVision version 3.1	 Applied Imaging	 Santa Clara	 CA).  Go to: Results RAD50 687delT is a founder mutation with incomplete penetrance  A cohort of 317 consecutive	 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients operated at the Oulu University Hospital from April 2000 through July 2004 were screened for the 4 Mre11 complex alterations. The frequency of the observed alleles was compared with those of 1000 population controls. Altogether eight RAD50 687delT carriers (8 out of 317) were identified among the studied breast cancer cases	 the frequency being significantly higher than in controls (6 out of 1000) (P = 0.008	 OR 4.3	 95% CI 1.5â€“12.5). The mean age at diagnosis did not differ between patients with RAD50 687delT mutation (57.9 years) and non-carriers (58.0 years). Of the studied 317 cases 70 were considered familial	 two of which (BR-0492	 BR-0279) were found positive for RAD50 687delT. The study of additional affected family members	 however	 indicated incomplete segregation of the mutation (Figure 1A). Two RAD50 687delT carriers (BR-0225	 BR-0234) had family history of other cancers (at least two cases in first- or second-degree relatives)	 whereas the rest (BR-04126	 BR-018	 BR-0077 and BR-01163) showed no evidence for clustering of cancer in the family.

Age at diagnosis	 when known	 is shown after cancer type (Br	 breast; Csu	 ... Owing to the relatively high frequency of RAD50 687delT in the Finnish cohort	 altogether 512 breast cancer cases from Sweden	 Norway and Iceland were screened to obtain more information about the geographical occurrence of this allele. However	 RAD50 687delT was not observed	 which suggests that it is a Finnish founder mutation. The common origin of the mutation was confirmed by microsatellite marker analysis of the 14 carriers	 which all shared the same haplotype not present in the 8 analyzed non-carriers (data not shown).  Other alterations observed in the Northern Finnish unselected breast cancer cohort  Of the other studied RAD50 alterations Arg224His was observed twice (2 out of 317	 0.6%)	 which did not differ from the controls (9 out of 1000	 0.9%)	 whereas Ile94Leu was not detected (0 out of 317). Consequently	 the current results do not support the association of these two changes with breast cancer susceptibility. However	 when screening for the Ile94Leu alteration a novel RAD50 splicing mutation	 RAD50 IVS3-1G>A	 was observed in one patient (BR-0490) with breast cancer at the age of 56. There were several breast cancer cases in the family (Figure 1B)	 but only two additional ones were available for mutation testing: the sister of the index case was identified as carrier	 whereas the maternal cousin tested negative. RAD50 IVS3-1G>A was not present in 1000 population controls (Table I).  Table I Table I Pathogenica RAD50 and NBS1 germline changes observed in unselected Northern Finnish breast cancer cases The NBS1 Leu150Phe substitution was observed in two patients (BR-0483	 BR-02114)	 but not among controls (P = 0.058	 Table I). Patient BR-0483 had breast cancer at the age of 58	 and was considered to be a familial case as her daughter had had ovarian cancer at age 17 (Figure 1C). In addition	 the daughter tested positive for the Leu150Phe allele. Case BR-02114 had breast cancer at the age of 54. She had family history of stomach and thyroid cancer (Figure 1C)	 but no additional DNA samples were available for mutation testing. The common origin of the two currently identified NBS1 Leu150Phe carriers and one previously observed carrier (17) was verified by microsatellite marker analysis (data not shown).  RAD50 IVS3-1G>A leads to frameshift  The effect of RAD50 IVS3-1G>A on mRNA splicing was evaluated by cDNA-specific amplification of RAD50 exon 3. Only one PCR product corresponding to the predicted size was observed in 1% agarose gel. However	 sequencing revealed that IVS3-1G>A leads to one base pair deletion between exon 2 and 3 in the mRNA sequence (214delG)	 thus resulting in a premature translation stop at codon 78. This observation was supported by the Splice site prediction program (http://www.fruitfly.org/seq_tools/splice.html). Even though IVS3-1G>A abolishes the existing acceptor site (score 0.97)	 it creates a new one right next to the previous site (score 0.11). The RAD50 214delG transcript was present at lower levels than the wild-type	 which indicates that it is unstable (data not shown).  Loss of the wild-type allele is not implicated in the tumorigenesis of RAD50 and NBS1 mutation carriers  The AI analysis was performed in the carriers of three potentially pathogenic alterations (Table I). Of the breast tumors of eight RAD50 687delT	 one RAD50 IVS3-1G>A and two NBS1 Leu150Phe carriers	 only two showed AI: one positive for RAD50 687delT and one for NBS1 Leu150Phe. However	 both tumors showed decrease in the intensity of the mutant allele (data not shown)	 which was confirmed by sequencing.  RAD50 687delT	 RAD50 IVS3-1G>A and NBS1 Leu150Phe carriers display genomic instability  To investigate whether these three heterozygous mutations lead to genomic instability	 cytogenetic analysis of peripheral blood T-lymphocytes from four affected RAD50 687delT (BR-018	 BR-0492	 BR-04126	 BR-01163)	 two RAD50 IVS3-1G>A (BR-0516	 BR-0490) and two NBS1 Leu150Phe (BR-0483	 BR-0480) carriers was performed. Six mutation-negative age-matched healthy controls were used as reference. The carriers showed a significant increase in the number of chromosomal aberrations (Table II and Figure 2) (P = 0.006). Particularly	 both simple and complex chromosomal rearrangements were found more frequently in carriers than in healthy controls (P = 0.002 and P = 0.010	 respectively)	 whereas for chromosome/chromatid breaks and deletions the difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.204). In contrast	 telomeric associations were rare as they were seen only once in one RAD50 687delT and in one NBS1 Leu150Phe carrier. All observed chromosomal aberrations were considered random	 as no preference for specific break site or evidence for clonality was observed.

Table II Table II Chromosomal aberrations in heterozygous RAD50 687delT	 RAD50 IVS3-1G>A and NBS1 Leu150Phe mutation carriers	 and healthy controls Go to: Discussion Given the importance of the Mre11 complex in the maintenance of genomic integrity and in preventing cells from malignancy	 we have evaluated the significance of four Mre11 complex germline alterations in breast cancer susceptibility. Of these RAD50 687delT and NBS1 Leu150Phe alleles	 in addition to a novel RAD50 IVS3-1G>A splicing mutation	 appeared to associate with predisposition to cancer.  The current results suggest that RAD50 687delT is a Finnish founder mutation	 which confers increased risk of breast cancer. The risk is apparent in women unselected for family history: the frequency of RAD50 687delT carriers among patients was 4-fold compared with healthy controls (95% CI 1.5â€“12.5	 P = 0.008). No difference in allele frequency between cases with (2 out of 70) or without (6 out of 247) family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer was observed	 which is at least partially due to the low number of cases considered as familial. Nevertheless	 in the two families displaying both RAD50 687delT and breast cancer	 clustering of the disease cannot be explained by this mutation alone. The incomplete segregation suggests that RAD50 687delT is a low-penetrance susceptibility allele	 which possibly multiplies the cancer risk in cooperation with susceptibility alleles in other genes and environmental factors	 as suggested by the polygenic model for breast cancer susceptibility. According to this model the genetic susceptibility to breast cancer is due to several loci	 each conferring a modest independent risk (22). Consequently	 these low-penetrance alleles might account for a substantial fraction of breast cancer incidence without necessarily causing evident familial clustering. This also suggests the possibility that a significant portion of the seemingly sporadic cancer cases could in fact be due to genetic predisposition (23).  It appears that RAD50 687delT does not produce a stable protein product (C. Attwooll and J. Petrini	 unpublished data). This dosage variation may have direct influence on DNA damage recognition and response pathway activities (24)	 which is supported by the increase of genetic instability in RAD50 687delT carriers. The identification of another RAD50 mutation	 IVS3-1G>A	 associated with genomic instability further suggests the existence of additional cancer susceptibility alleles in this evolutionarily conserved gene. These may	 however	 not only be very rare	 affecting perhaps only one or two families	 but also population specific. Consequently	 this suggests that screening of the RAD50 gene for additional germline mutations in other populations might be beneficial.  The association of NBS1 Leu150Phe with breast cancer susceptibility is supported by the identification of two more carriers in the current cohort (0.6%	 2 out of 317). Yet	 the families displaying NBS1 Leu150Phe do not show exclusively breast	 but also other malignancies	 including gynecological and stomach cancer. This feature was also evident in the previously reported mutation-positive family (17). Although NBS1 Leu150Phe has been so far observed only in affected individuals	 its frequency in the studied cohort is too low to reach statistical significance when compared with controls (P = 0.058). However	 its pathogenicity is supported by the increase in chromosomal instability in mutation carriers. It is possible that substitution of the evolutionarily conserved Leu150 residue is critical for BRCT domain function. This domain seems essential for the interaction between NBS1 and histone Î³-H2AX after irradiation (25)	 suggesting that it plays an important role in DNA damage recognition. Indeed	 other changes in conserved residues of the BRCT domain	 GlyGly136â€“137GluGlu and Tyr176Ala	 have been shown to disrupt the Mre11 complex nuclear focus formation and to block NBS1 phosphorylation after irradiation (26). Additionally	 the NBS1 Ile171Val allele that is pathogenic for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and aplastic anemia (12	27) has been associated with an increase in numerical and structural chromosomal aberrations (27)	 suggesting a defect in the DNA damage response.  The tested heterozygous carriers of RAD50 687delT	 RAD50 IVS3-1G>A and NBS1 Leu150Phe all showed an increase in genomic instability compared with healthy controls. Although based on a small number of individuals analysed	 the total number of chromosome aberrations observed in mutation carrier T-lymphocytes (mean 13.6	 SD 8.4) was increased 7-fold compared with non-carrier healthy controls (mean 1.9	 SD 1.9) (P = 0.006). In particular	 the number of chromosomal rearrangements was significantly increased (P = 0.002). As the Mre11 complex has been implicated in multiple cellular responses to DNA damage (3)	 the elevated frequency of spontaneous translocations in mutation carriers could reflect a deficiency in DNA repair. In fact	 experimental analyses have shown that DSBs are the principal lesions involved in the process of chromosomal aberration formation. Defects in the DSB repair pathways may lead to broken chromosomes and chromosome rearrangements	 and this genomic instability could be connected to increased mutation rates of cancer-related genes	 ultimately contributing to tumorigenesis (28). Interestingly	 epidemiological studies have shown that people with elevated frequency of chromosomal aberrations in their peripheral blood lymphocytes have a significantly elevated risk of developing cancer. Consequently	 it has been suggested that the occurrence of chromosomal aberrations could be a relevant biomarker for cancer risk	 reflecting either early biological effects of genotoxic carcinogens or individual cancer susceptibility (29).  The elevated spontaneous chromosomal instability of heterozygous mutation carriers suggests an effect for RAD50 and NBS1 haploinsufficiency on genomic integrity. Indeed	 it has previously been indicated that in the case of tumor suppressor genes participating in the maintenance of the genomic stability the gene-dosage effect rather than biallelic inactivation is sufficient to exert a cellular phenotype that leads to tumorigenesis. However	 these genes may show differences in tissue-specific protein-dosage thresholds	 below which they fail to operate normally (24). For NBS1 heterozygosity and cancer predisposition there is supporting evidence also from mouse models. In addition to lymphomas	 heterozygous NBS1 knockdown mice developed a wide array of tumors affecting the liver	 mammary gland	 prostate and lung. Additionally	 it was demonstrated that haploinsufficiency	 not loss of heterozygosity	 was the mechanism underlying tumor development. Moreover	 this study provided evidence that NBS1 heterozygosity predisposes cells to malignancy most likely because of chromosomal instability and defects in DNA repair (30).  As the current results suggest that Mre11 complex mutations act in a haploinsufficient manner	 it raises the question about the importance of inactivation of these genes also in sporadic cancer cases. The first suggestion of reduced dosage of RAD50 at the somatic level already comes from acute myeloid leukemia (AML)	 since a strong correlation between AML and chromosomal aberrations involving the RAD50 containing 5q23-q31 chromosomal region has been observed (31). However	 no direct implication of RAD50 defects in AML has yet emerged. Nevertheless	 it is rather interesting that the currently identified RAD50 IVS3-1G>A positive family also shows one case of leukemia.  In conclusion	 current results support the contribution of RAD50 687delT	 RAD50 IVS3-1G>A and NBS1 Leu150Phe in hereditary susceptibility to breast cancer	 and probably also other cancers. In particular	 RAD50 687delT seems to be a relatively common low-penetrance breast cancer susceptibility allele in Northern Finland	 and the risk associated with it is apparent in women unselected for family history. The elevated spontaneous chromosomal instability in peripheral blood lymphocytes of heterozygous mutation carriers suggests an effect for RAD50 and NBS1 haploinsufficiency on genomic integrity and predisposition to cancer.  Approximately 5â€“10% of all breast and ovarian cancers are due to genetic predisposition.1 Germline mutations in two major susceptibility genes	 BRCA1 and BRCA2	 explain most of the hereditary ovarian cancer cases	 but worldwide have been observed only in a fraction of the breast cancer families; in Finland	 about 20%.2â€“4 A small portion of the remaining cases	 perhaps 1â€“2%	 appears to be caused by germline mutations in other cancer susceptibility genes such as TP53	 PTEN	 AR	 and ATM. 5 Recently	 moderate or low penetrance germline mutations such as 1100delC of CHK2 have also been implicated	6 suggesting that in many cases the phenotypic expression of the disease is accounted for by the combined effect of multiple but more subtle mutations in different target genes.5 7 Despite all these discoveries	 many breast cancer families	 especially those with fewer than four cases and/or with later disease onset	 have cancers due to mutations in still unknown genes. As the protein products of the genes so far indicated are central players in the pathways involved in cell cycle checkpoint functions and in the sensing	 transduction	 and repair of DNA lesions	5 other similarly acting genes may represent new potential candidates for breast and/or ovarian cancer susceptibility. The Mre11 complex	 composed of the proteins MRE11	 NBS1	 and RAD50	 is a vital component in the DNA damage response and is at least partially responsible for connecting DNA damage detection to DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint functions. The early association of the complex with damaged DNA suggests its involvement in sensing DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). In eukaryotes	 DSB repair is handled by two different pathways	 homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)	 and the initial step in both is the recognition and signalling of the damage by the Mre11 complex.8â€“10 In addition to DNA damage detection and repair	 the complex has an important role in co-ordinating checkpoint responses and DNA replication	11â€“14 and is also required for the maintenance of telomeres.15 The sites important for the composition and various functional activities of the Mre11 complex have been characterised (summarised in fig 1). Because of its independent interaction with both NBS1 and RAD50	 MRE11 has been viewed as the core of the complex	 whereas the interaction between NBS1 and RAD50 is indirect and mediated through MRE11.9 16 17 The sites in MRE11 responsible for binding to NBS1 and RAD50 have both been assigned to the aminoterminal half of the protein.16 18 In NBS1	 the MRE11 binding domain has been located to the extreme carboxyterminus of the protein	16 and the corresponding site in RAD50 has been located to a 40 residue coiled coil region adjacent to the ABC domain.19 20 Additionally	 several other important domains for the complex function have been identified. The DNA nuclease activity is restricted to MRE11 and specified by phosphodiesterase motifs in the aminoterminal half of the molecule.18 The aminoterminus of NBS1 exhibits a forkhead associated (FHA) domain	 followed by a BRCA1 carboxyterminal (BRCT) domain.21 Both of these highly conserved domains are involved in proteinâ€“protein interactions and are therefore crucial for the functions of the Mre11 complex	 including its ............................................................... .

Seven novel heterozygous alterations were observed	 three of which were considered potentially disease-related: MRE11 913CRT (Arg305Trp)	 NBS1 448CRT (Leu150Phe) and RAD50 687delT (stop codon at 234). N RAD50 687delT is expected to cause major truncation in both known protein isoforms and occurs in multiple individuals of two families. Curiously	 RAD50 687delT was also present in some of the controls	 but at a lower frequency	 probably referring to incomplete penetrance. The MRE11 and NBS1 alterations affected highly conserved amino acids and were seen in single cancer cases	 but they were both absent in 1000 healthy controls. N Our results suggest that these three mutations in the Mre11 complex genes associate with hereditary susceptibility to breast and/or ovarian cancer	 and may be important in other types of cancer too. This is the first time to our knowledge that germline mutations in RAD50 have been linked to genetic disease in humans. 1 www.jmedgenet.com subcellular localisation after DNA damage.17 22 RAD50 in turn consists of bipartite N- and C-terminal ATPase segments	 which assemble into a single ABC-type cassette at the end of the predicted antiparallel coiled coil.19 A functionally important zinc hook has been identified in the central portion of the coiled coil domain.23 This zinc hook is thought to mediate RAD50 dimerisation	 which allows the required molecular flexibility of the Mre11 complex and keeps it functionally assembled during the DNA recombination and repair process.14 The Mre11 complex proteins interact with several important protein partners	 many of which have been related to cancer predisposition. For instance	 following ionising radiation	 NBS1 is phosphorylated in an ATM dependent manner to ensure proper response to DNA damage.11 In turn	 MRE11 phosphorylation relies on NBS1.24 Co-operation between a functional Mre11 complex and ATM is also required for activation of the CHK2 kinase in response to DNA damage.12 In addition	 MRE11	 NBS1 and RAD50 are linked through proteinâ€“protein interactions with BRCA1. After exposure to ionising radiation	 BRCA1 forms nuclear foci that co-localise with the Mre11 complex.25 Along with BRCA1	 ATM	 and other proteins	 MRE11	 NBS1	 and RAD50 are also part of a multi-subunit protein complex referred to as the BRCA1 associated genome surveillance complex (BASC).26 Failure in the DNA damage response and repair processes causes chromosomal instability that may result in cancer predisposition. For two of the Mre11 complex genes	 namely MRE11 and NBS1	 the connection to cancer has already been established: germline mutations in MRE11 are associated with the ataxia telangiectasia-like disorder (ATLD)	27 whereas defects in NBS1 cause Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS).9 21 Cells derived from ATLD and NBS patients display similar characteristics as those from ataxia telangiectasia (AT) patients	 and AT due to germline mutations in the ATM gene has been associated with an increased risk of developing various malignancies; breast cancer	 lymphoma	 and leukaemia in particular.28 As yet	 germline mutations in RAD50 have not been connected to genetic diseases in humans. However	 in mice certain germline RAD50 mutations result in growth defects and cancer predisposition.29 Because mutations in ATM	 CHK2	 and BRCA1 have all been previously linked to hereditary predisposition to breast and/or ovarian cancer5 it is possible that germline mutations in the individual Mre11 complex genes may also be directly involved in predisposition to these cancers. The suggested connection has been supported by a recent study	 where the NBS1 657del5 founder mutation was found to be responsible for the occurrence of a small but significant portion of familial breast cancer cases.30 On these grounds	 we tested 151 index patients from Finnish families with signs of hereditary susceptibility to breast and/or ovarian cancer for possible germline mutations in the MRE11	 NBS1	 and RAD50 genes. The results of our study indicate novel disease associated alterations. MATERIALS AND METHODS Subjects and unaffected controls Index cases diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer of 151 families originating from northern Finland were selected for the screening of germline MRE11	 NBS1	 and RAD50 mutations. Of the studied families	 95 were associated with breast	 29 with breastâ€“ovarian	 and 4 with ovarian cancer. These families met the criteria for either high (76 families) or moderate (52 families) genetic susceptibility to breast and/or ovarian cancer. Inclusion criteria for the families were one or more of the following: (a) two to three or more cases of breast and/or ovarian cancer in first or second degree relatives; (b) early disease onset ((35 years); (c) bilateral breast cancer; or (d) multiple primary tumours including breast or ovarian cancer in the same individual. The high risk families mainly included three or more cancer cases. All of the high risk families had been screened for germline mutations in BRCA1	 BRCA2	 CHK2	 and TP53	 and eleven of them were found to be BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation positive.4 31 32 Besides high or moderate risk families	 23 families showing single cases of breast or ovarian cancer along with multiple cases (two or more) of other kinds of cancer in first or second degree relatives were included in the study. Additionally	 1000 anonymous cancer free individuals were used as controls	 and the occurrence of novel	 potentially pathogenic alterations was also investigated in 192 breast cancer patients without family history of the disease. Both groups derived from the same geographical area as the studied families. All patients had given their informed consent for obtaining pedigree data and blood specimens for a study on cancer susceptibility gene mutations. Approval to perform the study was obtained from the ethics board of the Northern Ostrobotnia Health Care District and the Finnish Ministry of Social Affairs and Health. Screening for germline mutations DNA from blood lymphocytes was extracted using the standard phenolâ€“chloroform method or the Puregene D- 50K purification kit (Gentra	 Minneapolis	 MN	 USA). The coding regions and exonâ€“intron boundaries of the MRE11	 NBS1	 and RAD50 genes were screened for germline mutations by conformation sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE)	 which has been shown to be a cost efficient way to scan genes with high sensitivity and specifity.4 33 Samples with band shift were reamplified and the sequencing analysis was performed with the Li-cor IR2 4200-S DNA Analysis system (Li-cor Inc.	 Lincoln	 NE	 USA) using the SequiTherm EXELTM II DNA Sequencing kit LC (Epicentre Technologies	 Madison	 WI	 USA). Oligonucleotides for CSGE and sequencing were designed by using Primer3 software based on sequence information obtained from publicly available databases. Oligonucleotide sequences and PCR conditions are available upon request. LOH analysis Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis was performed to assess whether the tumours of the patients displaying the novel MRE11 and RAD50 germline mutations had lost the wildtype allele. The flanking microsatellite DNA markers used for MRE11 were D11S4176 and D11S1757; and for RAD50 D5S2110	 D5S2057	 D5S1984	 D5S2002	 and D5S2117. The PCR products were analysed with the Li-cor DNA Analysis system using the IRD800 labelled forward primer. Figure 1 Components of the Mre11 complex.

Using the FastTrackH 2.0 Kit (Invitrogen	 Carlsbad	 CA	 USA)	 mRNA from lymphoblast cell lines was isolated	 following which cDNA synthesis was carried out with the GeneRacerTM kit (Invitrogen). The use of the GeneRacerTM Kit ensured that only transcripts containing full length cDNA ends were used in PCR analysis. Primers used for the cDNA specific amplification of RAD50 exon 5 were: forward 59-TTTGAAGCAAAAGTTTGATGAGA-39 (located in exon 4) and reverse 59- TCATTGTCAAGTTTCATTATTTTAGAG-39 (located in exon 6). RESULTS Novel germline alterations The mutation analysis of the MRE11	 NBS1	 and RAD50 genes revealed several germline alterations. Eleven heterozygous changes in protein encoding regions were observed (summarised in tables 1 and 2). Seven of the alterations were novel and three of these were considered potentially disease related. In addition	 a large number of different apparently harmless alterations occurring in intron regions was seen (data not shown). MRE11 and NBS1 In the MRE11 gene	 a single mutation in exon 10 was found in one index case with ovarian cancer (case 322	 fig 2A). This novel single base change	 a transition CRT at position 913	 resulted in substitution of arginine to tryptophan at codon 305. The position of the involved arginine is extremely conserved between several species	 even those distantly related (fig 4) (yeast and flowering plant: data not shown). Additionally	 the flanking regions on both sides of this residue are well conserved	 suggesting functional importance. In contrast to MRE11	 multiple alterations within the protein encoding region of NBS1 were detected	 but only one was considered potentially pathogenic. This novel change	 a CRT transition at nucleotide 448	 results in substitution of leucine to phenylalanine at codon 150 and was displayed by one index case diagnosed with breast cancer (case 277	 fig 2B). Interestingly	 this alteration occurs in the middle of the highly conserved BRCT domain	 where the leucine residue at position 150 is conserved also in the mouse	 rat	 and chicken orthologues (fig 4). Both the MRE11 and NBS1 mutations were observed in single multi-cancer families including one ovarian or one breast cancer case	 respectively	 but co-segregation with the cancer phenotype could not be confirmed owing to lack of DNA specimens from additional family members. However	 both of the mutations were absent from a large cohort of population controls (n = 1000)	 indicating that these mutations may indeed relate to cancer predisposition (table 1). RAD50 In RAD50	 four novel germline changes affecting exon regions were discovered (tables 1 and 2). Of these changes	 His68His appears to be a harmless polymorphism	 but the roles of Ile94Leu and Arg224His alterations remain more difficult to determine. Both of these substitutions affect conserved residues	 the former in the remarkably well conserved aminoterminal ATPase domain and the latter in the coiled coil domain	19 20 but they also occurred in the healthy controls	 although at lower frequency. Interestingly	 one of the breast cancer families displaying the RAD50 Ile94Leu variant also showed partial co-segregation with the previously identified CHK2 Ile157Thr unknown variant.31 Until further clarifying studies have been carried out	 the cancer predisposing role of these two RAD50 variants remains unknown. However	 at least one of the identified RAD50 alterations	 687delT	 is likely to be disease related. The RAD50 687delT truncation mutation The RAD50 687delT mutation in exon 5 leads to a premature stop at codon 234 and affects both isoforms of the protein.

Electronic letter 3 www.jmedgenet.com The deletion was found in two separate families (fig 3). In family 5	 the index case and her sister (cases 828 and 474)	 both diagnosed with breast cancer	 were carriers of the mutation. In family 6	 the index (case 505) with ovarian cancer carried RAD50 687delT	 but had also tested positive for the BRCA1 3745delT mutation in one of our previous studies.4 In addition	 the deceased mother with ovarian cancer was an obligatory carrier of at least the RAD50 687delT mutation. In all the other cases tested	 both the RAD50 and the BRCA1 truncation mutation segregated incompletely with the disease. The observation of unaffected RAD50 truncation mutation carriers in family 6	 and also the surprisingly high prevalence at the population level (0.6%) suggested not only that RAD50 687delT	 if truly pathogenic	 exhibits low penetrance	 but also that it might predispose carriers to cancer without clustering of the disease in the pedigrees. In order to test this hypothesis	 we screened 192 breast cancer cases without family history of the disease for the RAD50 truncation mutation. In parallel	 we also screened the same cases for the MRE11 and NBS1 mutations	 as the disease segregation of these two alterations could not be confirmed from the pedigrees. As none of the tested alterations was observed in the studied cohort	 it may suggest that these changes are mainly associated with patients with a family history of cancer. As RAD50 687delT is expected to cause truncation of most of the protein product	 we evaluated whether these mutant transcripts are eliminated by nonsense mediated decay. Lymphoblast cell lines generated from blood specimens of three different mutation positive individuals (fig 3: family 5	 case 828; family 6	 cases 505 and 061) was used to produce mRNA for the cDNA synthesis. The results from sequencing analysis unambiguously demonstrated that in all studied cases both the wild type and the truncation allele were still present in the tested mRNA pool (data not shown). MRE11 and RAD50 LOH analysis In order to test the nature of the observed mutations	 we investigated whether the tumorigenesis thought to be Figure 2 Families exhibiting the novel (A) MRE11 Arg305Trp and (B) NBS1 Leu150Phe germline mutations.

LOH analysis was performed on the available tumour specimens from four different patients (cases 322	828	474	 and 505; figs 2 and 3) displaying either the MRE11 or RAD50 mutation	 but no LOH was observed (data not shown). Owing to the lack of suitable tumour material the corresponding LOH analysis for the NBS1 mutation could not be performed. DISCUSSION The Mre11 complex is an integral part of the proper DNA damage response and repair of double strand breaks	 essential for the wellbeing of any living organism. Failure in these highly conserved processes leads to the loss of genomic integrity and consequently to an elevated risk of cancer.14 The cellular functions of the Mre11 complex are indispensable	 as seen in mice	 where major deficiencies in any of the mre11	 nbs1	 or rad50 genes cause early embryonic lethality and only hypomorphic mutations appear to be viable.34â€“36 In humans	 only a small number of hypomorphic germline mutations affecting the MRE11 and NBS1 genes are currently known	 mainly associating with the severe and cancer prone phenotypes of ATLD and NBS	 respectively.21 27 37 Disease related germline mutations in RAD50 have not to our knowledge previously been reported. In the current study	 we have examined the prevalence of NBS1	 MRE11	 and RAD50 germline mutations in index cases with breast or ovarian cancer from 151 families. Of the novel heterozygous sequence alterations observed	 Arg305Trp (MRE11)	 Leu150Phe (NBS1)	 and 687delT (RAD50) potentially relate to cancer susceptibility (table 1). As the LOH analysis of tumours from MRE11 or RAD50 mutation carriers showed retention of the wild type alleles	 it may indicate that these germline mutations are sufficient to cause the observed adverse phenotypic effect. However	 silencing of the wild type allele by epigenetic mechanisms (for example by promoter region hypermethylation) cannot be excluded. The association of the novel MRE11 and NBS1 missense mutations with hereditary cancer susceptibility is supported by their absence in both the controls and the unselected breast cancer cases. In addition	 both amino acid substitutions occur in highly conserved protein domains. In MRE11	 the Arg305Trp substitution takes place at the very end of the first of two major protein domains	20 replacing the conserved positively charged hydrophilic arginine with the neutral and highly hydrophobic tryptophan. Because of its position in the protein	 it is possible that the Arg305Trp substitution may affect the structural organisation of the functionally active L shaped groove located between domains 1 and 2	38 and perhaps lower the affinity of MRE11 for DNA binding. The situation could be similar to that indicated for the Asn117Ser mutation in ATLD;27 despite the fact that the change occurs relatively remote from the active site	 it has been suggested to disturb the macromolecular interaction of MRE11.20 In NBS1	 the Leu150Phe substitution involves the highly conserved BRCT domain (fig 4)	 where the conserved leucine is replaced with the biochemically non-similar phenylalanine. Interestingly	 another amino acid substitution affecting a conserved residue in the BRCT domain	 Ile171Val	 has previously been associated with cancer (acute lymphoblastic leukaemia).39 Additionally	 recent site specific mutagenesis experiments by Cerosaletti & Concannon40 indicate that changes at the conserved residues GlyGly136â€“137GluGlu or Tyr176Ala are capable of disrupting Mre11 complex nuclear focus formation and blocking NBS1 phosphorylation after irradiation	 emphasising the functional importance of this region and especially the role of the conserved amino acids in the BRCT domain. However	 in order to obtain proof of the proposed deleterious nature of the MRE11 and NBS1 missense mutations discovered in the current study	 the biochemical effects of these alterations has to be demonstrated by functional assays. Furthermore	 additional caseâ€“control series are needed to confirm their possible role of as cancer susceptibility alleles. Of the novel germline alterations observed in this study	 RAD50 687delT was probably the most dramatic as it is predicted to cause about 80% shortening of both isoforms of the protein. The truncated protein would have retained only the N-terminal portion of the sequence necessary for binding of the RAD50 dimer to MRE11	 but would have lost the corresponding and equally important C-terminal site.23 Based on studies of lymphoblast cell lines we know that the deletion allele is expressed at the mRNA level	 but it is currently unknown if it actually gives rise to a truncated protein	 how stable this product would be	 and whether it has effects on the function of the wild type protein	 perhaps by disturbing the functionally important dimerisation of RAD50. If a shortened protein actually is produced	 but is unstable	 the effect is likely to be that of a null mutation. This dosage variation due to haploinsufficiency may have a direct Figure 4 Novel amino acid substitutions in MRE11 and NBS1	 and comparison of sequence homology between Homo sapiens (hs)	 Rattus norvegicus (rn)	 Mus musculus (mm) and Gallus gallus (gg). The sites showing changed residues are boxed. The amino acids conserved in all four species are drawn in blue	 biochemically similar residues in green	 and dissimilar ones in black. The sequence shown for MRE11 extends to its last two phosphodiesterase motifs (PDE IV and V)18 38 and for NBS1 corresponds to its BRCT domain.22 In NBS1 the two sites (136â€“137 and 176) marked with an asterisk (*) have been found to be critical for Mre11 complex nuclear focus formation and phosphorylation of NBS1 after irradiation	40 and the one marked with an arrowhead (171.) has been associated with acute lymphoid leukaemia.39 Electronic letter 5 www.jmedgenet.com influence on the activities in DNA damage recognition and response pathways	 and could modify the cancer risk by increasing genetic instability or by altering the effect of the normal DNA damage response.41 However	 the possibility that RAD50 687delT is a hypomorphic mutation	 analogous to the common Slavic NBS founder mutation NBS1 657del5	42 also cannot be excluded. Interestingly	 according to the recent study by Gorski et al	 the frequency of the NBS1 657del5 mutation in the population controls they used is comparable with that of RAD50 687delT in our study (both 0.6%). The RAD50 687delT mutation was observed altogether in seven individuals	 two of whom showed breast and two ovarian cancers	 all at relatively young age (41â€“50 years old). However	 in family 6 (fig 3 right) the situation is less straightforward	 as at least one of the affected individuals (case 505) showed parallel involvement of the previously identified BRCA1 3745delT truncation mutation.4 In addition	 there were several unaffected carriers of both mutations	 but the three daughters of case 505 found positive for either the RAD50 or the BRCA1 mutation	 or both	 may not yet contribute to the understanding of the disease penetrance owing to their relatively young age. Although at present it is difficult to determine the exact role of these two germline mutations in this family	 there are several scenarios worth exploring. It is possible that both RAD50 and BRCA1 act independently on the resultant phenotype. On the other hand	 co-occurrence of RAD50 687delT could also strengthen the effect of the BRCA1 mutation. Interestingly	 a recent comparative genome hybridisation targeted linkage analysis has revealed a possible BRCA1 penetrance modifier locus on 5q in a location close to RAD50. 43 44 Besides penetrance modification	 the RAD50 mutation may also in some way influence the tissue specificity of a BRCA1 associated malignancy. However	 it is also possible that in the genetic background provided by this particular family the mutation in RAD50 does not significantly increase the risk of cancer in BRCA1 3745delT carriers. The surprisingly high frequency of RAD50 687delT mutation carriers among the healthy population controls and its absence from the breast cancer cases without familial disease background suggests that RAD50 687delT may be a new low penetrance susceptibility allele associated particularly with hereditary predisposition to cancer. At present it is unknown whether the RAD50 687delT allele exists outside Finland	 as it is a well known fact that many disease related gene defects can be either unique or highly enriched in the Finnish population	 owing to founder effects	 isolation	 and genetic drift.45 However	 the situation could also be similar to that observed for the cancer predisposing CHK2 1100delC allele	 which is enriched in southern Finland	31 46 but also occurs at significant frequencies in many other European populations (for example	 the UK6 ). In order to obtain more information about the geographical occurrence and the overall relevance of the RAD50 687delT mutation	 the intention is to study additional breast	 ovarian	 and other hereditary cancer materials along with suitable control specimens	 initially from the Nordic countries. In addition	 functional studies are needed to reveal the exact details about the molecular consequences of the RAD50 687delT mutation. In conclusion	 this is the first time that germline mutations in RAD50 have been linked to genetic diseases in humans. The RAD50 deletion allele reported in this study provides evidence that deleterious germline mutations in the third member of the Mre11 complex exist	 are viable	 and appear to associate with predisposition to cancer. Additional investigations will be needed to confirm and follow up these preliminary leads on the role of Mre11 complex gene mutations in hereditary susceptibility to cancer.  The genes predisposing to familial breast cancer are largely unknown	 but 5 of the 6 known genes are involved in DNA damage repair. RAD50 is part of a highly conserved complex important in recognising	 signalling and repairing DNA double-strand breaks. Recently	 a truncating mutation in the RAD50 gene	 687delT	 was identified in 2 Finnish breast cancer families. To evaluate the contribution of RAD50 to familial breast cancer	 we screened the whole coding region for mutations in 435 UK and 46 Finnish familial breast cancer cases. We identified one truncating mutation	 Q350X	 in one UK family. We screened a further 544 Finnish familial breast cancer cases and 560 controls for the 687delT mutation	 which was present in 3 cases (0.5%) and 1 control (0.2%). Neither Q350X nor 687delT segregated with cancer in the families in which they were identified. Functional analyses suggested that RAD50 687delT is a null allele as there was no detectable expression of the mutant protein. However	 the wild-type allele was retained and expressed in breast tumors from mutation carriers. The abundance of the full-length RAD50 protein was reduced in carrier lymphoblastoid cells	 suggesting a possible haploinsufficiency mechanism. These data indicate that RAD50 mutations are rare in familial breast cancer and either carry no	 or a very small	 increased risk of cancer. Altogether	 these results suggest RAD50 can only be making a very minor contribution to familial breast cancer predisposition in UK and Finland. Â© 2005 Wiley-Liss	 Inc. The genes predisposing to familial breast cancer are largely unknown. There are 2 major breast cancer susceptibility genes	 BRCA1 and BRCA2	 and 4 minor genes	 TP53	 CHEK2	 ATM and PTEN; but collectively mutations in these genes only account for approximately 20â€“30% of the familial risk of breast cancer.1	2	 3 Therefore	 the susceptibility genes underlying most familial breast cancer remain to be identified.  Five of the six known breast cancer susceptibility genes	 BRCA1	 BRCA2	 CHEK2	 ATM and TP53	 encode proteins implicated in genome integrity monitoring that have multiple interactions with each other	 both directly and indirectly.4	 5 This suggests that mutations in some of the many other genes involved in the DNA damage response pathways may also be involved in breast cancer susceptibility.  The highly conserved MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 (MRN) complex has a central role in many cellular responses to DNA double-strand breaks	 including homologous recombination	 nonhomologous end-joining	 telomere maintenance and DNA damage checkpoint activation.6 The complex consists of the large coiled-coil ATP-binding cassette ATPase RAD50	 the nuclease MRE11 and the checkpoint mediator NBS1.  Hypomorphic biallelic NBS1 mutations cause the autosomal recessive condition	 Nijmegen breakage syndrome	 which is characterised by microcephaly	 immunodeficiency and tumor predisposition	 particularly lymphomas.7 Biallelic MRE11 mutations cause ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder (ALTD)	 which is characterised by slowly progressive ataxia and ocular apraxia.8 Mutations in RAD50 have not been associated with a defined human phenotype. However	 a hypomorphic mutation of RAD50 has been identified in a patient suffering from a syndrome broadly reminiscent of NBS.5 Recently	 a 687delT truncating RAD50 mutation was reported in 2 breast cancer families from Northern Finland.9  RAD50 is a 1	312-amino acid protein that contains 2 ABC-ATPase domains separated by 2 coiled-coil regions required for intramolecular interactions. A Cys-X-X-Cys motif located in the middle of the coiled-coil domain functions as a dimerization domain between 2 RAD50 arms.10	 11 The 687delT mutation leads to a premature stop at codon 234 and the function of the mutant protein would be predicted to be severely compromised.  To evaluate the role of RAD50 in breast cancer predisposition	 we have screened the coding region of the gene in 481 UK and Finnish breast cancer families and have specifically evaluated the Finnish 687delT mutation in 590 Finnish familial breast cancer cases and 560 controls. Material and methods  Patients and controls  Familial breast cancer cases and controls were collected from UK and Finland. The UK samples were collected through the Breast Cancer Susceptibility Collaboration (UK). Consent was obtained from all cases and the research was approved by the London Multiresearch Ethics Committee. Samples from individuals with breast cancer from 702 familial breast cancer pedigrees were analyzed. All samples were screened for mutations in the full coding sequence of BRCA1 and BRCA2	 as previously described.12 The breast cancer history in relatives of the index case was quantified using a family history score	 with 1 point for an affected first-degree relative or a second primary in the index case	 0.5 point for an affected second-degree relative and 0.25 for an affected third-degree relative. The majority of cases had a family history score of at least 2 (i.e. at least 2 first-degree relatives with breast cancer in addition to the affected index case	 or equivalent) and no case had a family history score less than 1 (i.e. at least one affected first-degree relative in addition to the affected index case	 or equivalent). Samples from 786 UK controls were obtained from Human Random Control DNA panels from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (Salisbury	 UK).  The Finnish series consisted of 590 familial breast cancer patients collected at the Helsinki University Central Hospital	 as previously described.13 Of these	 338 breast cancer patients had a strong family history (3 or more first- or second-degree relatives with breast or ovarian cancer in the family	 including the index case)	 as verified through the Finnish Cancer Registry and hospital records	 and 252 unrelated breast cancer cases had only a single affected first-degree relative. Among the 590 patients	 502 had a family history of breast cancer only and 88 had a relative with ovarian cancer. For 435 cases	 BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations had been excluded as previously described	14	 15 and for 155 the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation status was unknown. Controls were from 560 anonymous healthy blood donors from the Finnish Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service in Helsinki. Informed consent from the patients and permission for the study from the Ethics Committee of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology	 HUCH and the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health in Finland were obtained. RAD50 mutation analyses  The coding sequence and intronâ€“exon boundaries of RAD50 were analyzed using conformation sensitive gel electrophoresis	 CSGE	16 in 435 UK and 46 Finnish familial breast cancer cases. Primers and conditions are available on request. Genomic DNA from cases showing mobility shifts on CSGE was bidirectionally sequenced using the BigDyeTerminator cycle sequencing kit and an ABI 3100 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems	 Foster City	 CA).  The exon 7	 Q350X mutation was analysed in 267 additional UK familial breast cancer patient samples and 786 population controls by bidirectional sequencing of exon 7. The Finnish 687delT mutation and the Q350X mutation were screened in Finnish familial breast cancer patient samples and controls by minisequencing (primer extension).17 All positive minisequencing results were confirmed by reamplification from the original genomic DNA sample and direct sequencing (ABI BigDyeTerminator cycle sequencing kit (v3.0)	 ABI Prism 310 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems	 Foster City	 CA). Protein expression analysis of RAD50 687delT  The RAD50 protein expression was evaluated by immunoblotting on cell lysates from 3 lymphoblastoid cell lines established from heterozygous carriers of the 687delT mutation	 compared with a control lymphoblastoid cell line homozygous for wild-type RAD50. For immunoblotting analysis	 proteins from total cell lysates were separated using denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% SDS-PAGE) and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. The RAD50 protein was visualized on parallel blots after incubation with 3 distinct primary antibodies (ab3622 from Abcam	 Cambridge	 UK	 clone 13 from Transduction Laboratories	 Lexington	 KY and 13B3 from GeneTex	 San Antonio	 TX)	 using the ECL visualization reagents (Amersham	 Piscataway	 NJ). Immunohistochemistry of RAD50 expression on 687delT carrier tumors  The RAD50 protein expression was studied by immunohistochemical staining in 3 archival breast tumors from the same patients as above	 compared to a series of normal breast tissues (n = 15)	 familial breast carcinomas with apparently wild-type RAD50 (n = 25) and sporadic breast tumors (n = 27). For immunohistochemistry	 the tumor sections were deparaffinized and processed for sensitive immunoperoxidase staining with the primary mouse monoclonal antibody against human RAD50 (clone 2C6	 Abcam	 1:500 dilution)	 incubated overnight	 followed by detection using the Vectastain elite kit (Vector Laboratories	 Burlingame	 CA)	 as previously described.18 For analyses of the MRE11 and NBS1 proteins on parallel sections	 rabbit antibodies No. 4895 against MRE11 (Cell Signaling	 diluted 1:1	500) and No. 3002 against NBS1 (Cell Signaling	 diluted 1:100) were used	 respectively. Given that around 95% of epithelial cells were reproducibly and strongly positive on sections of normal breast	 we regarded as an aberrant decrease when the RAD50 protein was detectable in fewer than 70% of cancer cells in a particular lesion	 and the staining intensity of the remaining positive cancer cells was reduced compared with normal cells present on the same section. Bioinformatic analyses  SIFT-analysis19 (http://blocks.fhcrc.org/sift/SIFT) and PolyPhen20 (http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph/) were used to evaluate functional significance of the RAD50 missense variants found. SIFT program calculates tolerance scores for amino acid changes based on sequence alignment and conservation across protein family or across evolutionary history. PolyPhen (=Polymorphism Phenotyping) predicts possible impact of an amino acid substitution on the structure and function of a human protein	 using straightforward physical and comparative considerations. Results  RAD50 mutation analysis  We screened the coding region and exonâ€“intron boundaries of the RAD50 gene in 435 UK and 46 Finnish familial breast cancer cases and identified a single protein truncating mutation 1048C>T	 Q350X	 in a woman who developed bilateral breast cancer at 43 years (Fig. 1a	 Table I). The mutation was not present in her sibling	 who developed breast cancer at 73 years. Her mother developed ovarian cancer at 55 years and a paternal aunt developed breast cancer at 50 years. Unfortunately	 no further samples were available and therefore it is unknown whether the mutation arose de novo in the index case or was inherited from one of her parents	 or whether the paternal aunt carried the mutation. To further evaluate the Q350X mutation	 267 additional UK familial breast cancer cases	 786 UK controls	 235 Finnish breast cancer cases and 319 Finnish controls were screened for the mutation by direct sequencing or minisequencing. No further case or control with Q350X was identified.  Figure 1.  Figure 1.

The exonic missense variants were evaluated for possible functional effect by SIFT and PolyPhen analysis	 which suggested that R193W	 which was found in one UK breast cancer case and alters a key residue in the MRE11 binding segment	 likely affects RAD50 function. R224H and R327H may affect RAD50 function but the other variants appear well tolerated by SIFT and PolyPhen analysis. Pedigrees with tumor information of the families carrying the R193W	 R224H and R327H missense mutations are shown in Figure 1b.  The 687delT mutation found in the Finnish population previously was evaluated among index cases from 590 Finnish breast cancer families and 560 healthy population controls. The mutation was found in 3 familial patients (0.5%) and one control sample (0.2%). The characteristics of the breast cancer families with the 687delT mutation are shown in Figure 1c. Complete mutation screening of the whole RAD50 gene	 among 46 Finnish breast cancer families	 did not reveal any other coding RAD50 sequence variants present in breast cancer families from Southern Finland. The 687delT mutation was not found among the 435 UK families studied. Protein expression analysis of RAD50 687delT  Immunoblotting analysis of RAD50 protein in 687delT carrier lymphoblastoid cell lines showed a decreased overall abundance of the full-length protein product	 compared with a normal control lymphoblastoid cell line. In addition	 the truncated protein form was not detected in lysates from the cell lines with heterozygous RAD50 687delT or with any of the 3 antibodies	 including an antibody prepared specifically against the N-terminus of RAD50	 predicted to be preserved in the mutant protein (Fig. 2a).

Immunohistochemical analysis of 3 breast tumors from 687delT mutation carriers showed normal subcellular localisation of the RAD50 protein. The overall staining pattern was nuclear and the signal detected by this semiquantitative immunohistochemistry approach seemed comparable in the 3 mutation carrier tumors	 in a set of additional 25 familial breast carcinomas with apparently wild-type RAD50	 in the control normal breast tissues (n = 15	 with both luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells positive) and most of the 27 sporadic breast tumors examined (Fig. 2b). On the other hand	 a small subset of sporadic carcinomas (3 out of 27) showed grossly reduced abundance of the RAD50 protein (Fig. 2b). No obvious defects of either the MRE11 or NBS1 protein were detected among the 28 familial breast tumors examined for RAD50	 in contrast to the 3 sporadic carcinomas that showed concomitant reduction in staining of all 3 proteins of the MRN complex. Discussion  The possible role of RAD50 in familial breast cancer predisposition is intriguing as RAD50 participates in critical cellular functions of DNA double-strand break repair	 functionally interacting with other breast cancer predisposition genes.11	 21 In this study	 we have investigated the role of RAD50 in familial breast cancer by mutation analysis of the full gene in 481 breast cancer families from UK and Finland	 and have specifically evaluated a RAD50 truncating mutation previously identified in 2 Finnish breast cancer families.9  RAD50 mutation analysis revealed only a single protein truncating mutation	 Q350X	 in one of 481 breast cancer families studied. The mutation leads to truncation of 962 amino acids of the RAD50 protein	 including most of the coiled-coil domain	 the zinc-hook structure and the carboxyterminal ATP-binding domain.10	22	 23 The mutation was identified in a young-onset bilateral breast cancer case	 but was not present in her affected sister	 although it is noteworthy that the sister did not develop breast cancer until 73 years. There was a history of breast cancer on the paternal side and ovarian cancer in the mother	 but we were not able to evaluate whether or not either of these cases carried the mutation. No other case or control with the mutation was identified despite analysis of 1	488 UK samples and 717 Finnish samples. These data indicate that RAD50 Q350X is rare. Therefore	 even if it is contributing to cancer predisposition in family B1321	 it cannot be making a major contribution to familial breast cancer overall.  We identified 9 missense variants	 2 synonymous changes and 7 intronic RAD50 variants (Table I). Two of the missense variants (I94L and R224H) and one of the synonymous changes (H68H) have been reported previously.9 There was no strong evidence to suggest that any of these variants are breast cancer susceptibility alleles. Three variants	 R913W	 R224H and R327H	 may affect RAD50 function	 but all are rare	 each identified in only 1/481 cases	 limiting any potential contribution to breast cancer susceptibility	 even if they are pathogenic.  The protein truncating mutation 687delT was detected in 3/590 (0.5%) Finnish familial breast cancer cases and 1/560 controls (0.2%)	 but was not present in the 435 UK families studied. The mutation showed incomplete segregation with cancer in the families (Fig. 1c). This is consistent with previous data showing that RAD50 687delT did not segregate with cancer in one of the 2 families in which it was identified; the family also carried a pathogenic BRCA1 mutation.9 The combined 687delT frequency in families not tested positive for a BRCA1/2 mutation from Finland does not differ significantly from the frequency in controls (4/730	 0.55% vs. 7/1	560	0.40%	 OR 1.22	 95% CI 0.36â€“4.19	 p = 0.75). The presence of the mutation at similar frequency in cases and controls and the lack of segregation with cancer suggest that it either carries no increased risk of breast cancer	 or is a very low penetrance breast cancer susceptibility allele. The absence of the mutation in UK cases limited our ability to further evaluate the role of RAD50 687delT in breast cancer predisposition.  To investigate the functional effect of RAD50 687delT	 we studied RAD50 expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines from mutation carriers. This showed that the overall abundance of the full-length protein product was decreased and the truncated protein was not detected on immunoblotting. RAD50 687delT thus appears to be a null allele with no detectable expression of the mutant protein	 suggesting it is unlikely to have a dominant-negative effect on RAD50 function. In addition	 RAD50 protein expression and nuclear localization appeared normal in breast tumors from 687delT mutation carriers	 suggesting that the wild-type allele was retained and expressed. Similarly to RAD50	 the abundance and localisation of the MRE11 and NBS1 proteins appeared normal in all the 28 familial breast tumors examined by immunohistochemistry. The fact that we identified a small subset of sporadic breast tumors with a simultaneous gross reduction of all 3 proteins of the MRN complex is consistent with a previous study of sporadic carcinomas.24 Furthermore	 the latter cases also document that the antibodies and our assay conditions were appropriate to detect such aberrations at the protein level when they existed. The subset of MRN-deficient carcinomas (ref.24 and the present study) may reflect the recently reported constitutive activation of DNA damage checkpoints in preinvasive human breast and other lesions	 and the subsequent selection for defects of various components of the DNA damage response network as a way to overcome the anticancer barrier of such activated checkpoints during tumor progression.25  Our data on tumors and lymphoblastoid cell lines with the 687delT variant of RAD50 are consistent with loss of heterozygosity analyses both in our study (data not shown) and in breast tumors from previously reported 687delT carriers	 which demonstrated that the wild-type allele was not lost.9 However	 the overall amount of RAD50 in lymphoblastoid cells heterozygous for 687delT was reduced compared to that in noncarrier cells. These data suggest that RAD50 is not acting as a classical tumor suppressor gene in familial breast cancer	 although it is possible that RAD50 haploinsufficiency is contributing to cancer. Such a mechanism has been suggested by mouse models for important DNA damage/repair proteins whose defects contribute to tumorigenicity via loss or decrease	 including for example the tumor suppressor Chk1 kinase.26  In conclusion	 our data demonstrate that germ line variants in RAD50 occur at very low frequency in breast cancer families from UK and Finland. Rare truncating variants may be associated with a small increased cancer risk	 but do not appear to be acting as high penetrance mutations for breast cancer. RAD50 can only be making a very small contribution to familial breast cancer in the UK and Finnish populations.  																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											
4	73||Metastatic solid tumors are almost invariably fatal. Patients with disseminated small-cell cancers have a particularly unfavorable prognosis with most succumbing to their disease within two years. Here	 we report on the genetic and functional analysis of an outlier curative response of a patient with metastatic small cell cancer to combined checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) inhibition and DNA damaging chemotherapy. Whole-genome sequencing revealed a clonal hemizygous mutation in the Mre11 complex gene RAD50 that attenuated ATM signaling which in the context of Chk1 inhibition contributed	 via synthetic lethality	 to extreme sensitivity to irinotecan. As Mre11 mutations occur in a diversity of human tumors	 the results suggest a tumor-specific combination therapy strategy whereby checkpoint inhibition in combination with DNA damaging chemotherapy is synthetically lethal in tumor but not normal cells with somatic mutations that impair Mre11 complex function.' ' ' ' Keywords: DNA damage and repair	 cancer genomics	 exceptional responders	 targeted and systemic therapy	 RAD50' ' Go to:' ' INTRODUCTION' ' Curative therapy for patients with metastatic solid tumors remains elusive. Even with the much-heralded advent of targeted inhibitors of oncogenic signaling pathways	 drug resistance and disease progression occur in essentially all patients. We sought to define the mechanistic basis of a dramatic and durable response to systemic therapy in a 51-year old woman originally diagnosed with an invasive small-cell cancer of the ureter (Supplementary Fig. S1Aâ€“B). Small cell variant	 a rare histologic subtype that can arise throughout the urothelial tract	 is associated with a particularly poor prognosis. Following initial surgical resection and a short course of adjuvant chemotherapy (etoposide and cisplatin)	 her disease rapidly recurred. After a second surgery to remove recurrent and metastatic tumors in her kidney and retroperitoneal lymph nodes	 the patient again recurred with progressive metastatic disease prompting enrollment in an open-label phase 1 clinical trial of AZD7762	 an ATP-competitive checkpoint kinase inhibitor (Chk1/2)	 and weekly irinotecan	 a topoisomerase I inhibitor (1). Within 5 months	 the patient achieved a complete response that has proven durable despite discontinuation of drug therapy nearly 3 years ago (Fig. 1Aâ€“B). We performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of the tumor and matched normal tissue from this patient to investigate the genetic basis of this outlier example of curative systemic cancer therapy.' ' ' ' Figure 1' ' Figure 1' ' The treatment history and genomic landscape of a metastatic carcinoma with an extreme outlier response to combination therapy' ' Go to:' ' RESULTS' ' WGS of tumor DNA from the second surgery and matched normal blood revealed a complex somatic tumor genome (Fig. 1C). We identified 19	011 somatic point mutations and small insertions and deletions (indels)	 of which 147 were located in protein-coding or non-coding RNA regions of the genome (Supplementary Table 1). Overall	 the somatic mutation rate was 7.06 mutations per million bases	 similar to the only other reported whole genome sequence of a metastatic urothelial cancer reported to date (2). This genome also had a substantial number of DNA copy number alterations (CNAs)	 as is typical of p53-mutant bladder cancers (the tumor harbored a TP53 A161T mutation) (3). CNAs were the source of ~60% of all structural rearrangements identified in this tumor genome	 the burden of which was high (Supplementary Table 2).' ' ' ' As WGS was performed on the recurrent tumor specimen obtained after etoposide/cisplatin therapy but before trial enrollment	 we sought to determine whether the candidate driver mutations identified arose early in molecular time by analyzing the diagnostic tumor sample collected pre-etoposide/cisplatin therapy. Using a capture-based approach partly customized using the WGS findings (see Methods	 Supplementary Fig. 2A)	 we deeply sequenced 281 genes (Supplementary Tables 3â€“4). This confirmed that most of the mutations identified by WGS of the recurrent tumor affecting known cancer genes were present in the treatment-naÃ¯ve diagnostic tumor (Fig. 1D). Others pre-existed therapy but were not selected for and still others arose later in molecular time as they were present but subclonal only in the post-etoposide/cisplatin tumor.' ' ' ' We then performed an integrated analysis using the mutation	 DNA copy number	 and tumor clonality data generated by the WGS analysis together with the sum of information on pathways proximal to the mechanism of drug action in order to prioritize genomic aberrations that may have contributed to this patientâ€™s exceptional response. In addition to the mutation in TP53 (A161T)	 mutations identified in ATR and RAD50 were particularly noteworthy from the perspective of this patientâ€™s profound response to checkpoint inhibitor-based combination therapy (Supplementary Fig. 2Bâ€“D). While both were missense mutations	 in silico analyses suggested that whereas ATR H585D was unremarkable	 the RAD50 L1237F mutant was deemed to be the likeliest contributor to the profound response to systemic therapy observed in this patient. Several lines of evidence supported this prediction. The ATR mutation was heterozygous	 affected the poorly conserved H585 residue (Supplementary Fig. 2C)	 did not reside in a protein domain or motif of known significance	 was not recurrently mutated nor among a pattern of clustered mutations at this site (data not shown)	 and was not affected by a focal CNA	 arguing against selection for the ATR mutation during tumorigenesis (see Supplementary Materials).' ' ' ' Conversely	 the weight of the in silico evidence suggested that the novel missense mutation in RAD50 (L1237F) was a potential sensitizing lesion contributing to the profound response to systemic therapy observed in this patient. RAD50 is a component of the Mre11 complex	 a multi-subunit nuclease comprised of RAD50	 MRE11A	 and NBN (4)	 mutations of which are associated with DNA repair deficiency. This RAD50 L1237F allele was clonal in the index patient (present in 100% of tumor cells; Supplementary Fig. 3) and accompanied by focal deletion of the wildtype allele (Fig. 2A)	 with corresponding tumor-specific reduction of RAD50 protein expression confirmed by immunohistochemistry (Supplementary Fig. 4Aâ€“D). Further	 this mutation is situated in the D-loop of RAD50 (Fig. 2B)	 a region that influences ATP hydrolysis (5	 6). Recent structural analyses indicate that ATP hydrolysis has a profound effect on the functionality of the Mre11 complex	 which senses double strand breaks (DSB) and governs the DNA damage response (DDR) (7). Analyzing the mutational landscape of RAD50 in 7	494 sequenced tumors across 28 tumor types (Supplementary Table 5 and Supplementary Materials) revealed that not only do ~4% of all human tumors harbor Mre11 complex mutations	 but a subset of these cluster in regions adjacent to the L1237F-mutant D-loop motif of the RAD50 protein in diverse tumors (Fig. 2B). Notably	 these mutations were most common in urothelial bladder and colorectal tumors (11 and 8%) respectively	 the latter of which are often treated with irinotecan-based regimens (8). Additionally	 RAD50 L1237 is a very highly conserved residue	 along with several of the other RAD50 mutant alleles detected (Fig. 2C). Essentially all Rad50 orthologs have a Leucine (L	 Leu) at the position corresponding to human residue 1237. Bacteriophage T4 Rad50 is an exception	 possessing a Phenylalanine (F	 Phe) at this position (Fig. 2C). This suggested that the L1237F mutation would be hypomorphic rather than inactivating	 with the gene product retaining some residual function. Finally	 structural analysis of the Rad50 dimer confirmed the clustering of the L1237F mutation in the index tumor genome with other mutant alleles observed in diverse tumor types	 which together affect the D-loop motif and Walker B elements adjacent to ATP binding (Fig. 2D). In summary	 in silico analysis predicted that while ATR H585D was likely a passenger mutation	 the L1237F mutation and others observed in RAD50 in additional tumors may exert a significant functional impact.' ' ' ' Figure 2' ' Figure 2' ' D-loop and adjacent mutations in RAD50' ' We exploited the high degree of evolutionary conservation of the RAD50 D-loop to assess the functional significance of RAD50 L1237F by modeling this and other tumor-associated alleles in S. cerevisiae. Six rad50 mutant yeast strains were established: rad50L1240F (the yeast version of the mutation in the tumor genome)	 as well as mutations predicted to exert minor and major effects on D-loop structure (rad50L1240A and rad50L1240R respectively; see Methods	 Supplementary Table 6). Additionally	 we established rad50 mutant strains harboring D-loop (D1238N	 rad50D1241N) and non-D-loop but highly conserved (Q1259K	 rad50Q1262K) mutations identified in breast and endometrial carcinomas respectively.' ' ' ' All three rad50L1240 mutations appeared to destabilize the Rad50 protein	 as the steady state levels of the rad50L1240F and rad50L1240A gene products were reduced compared to wildtype	 while Rad50L1240R was nearly undetectable (Fig. 3A). Conversely	 the rad50D1241N and rad50Q1262K mutants had levels of Rad50 similar to wildtype cells. Nevertheless	 while these mutations had differing effects on Rad50 expression levels	 the Mre11 complex itself remained intact	 as indicated by co-immunoprecipitation with Mre11 (Fig. 3A). We further confirmed the apparent selection for RAD50 hemizygosity in the tumor [mutation and loss of heterozygosity (LOH)]	 as only diploid strains expressing homozygous rad50L1240F/L1240F (or rad50L1240F haploid cells) exhibited impaired survival following camptothecin (CPT; an analog of irinotecan) treatment (Supplementary Fig. 5â€“6). These data indicate selection for RAD50 hypomorphism in the index patient through mutation and LOH (Fig. 2A)	 resulting in the retention of only a single mutant allele with compromised function.' ' ' ' Figure 3' ' Figure 3' ' RAD50 hypomorphism attenuates ATM signaling	 synergizing with checkpoint inhibition to confer chemotherapy sensitivity' ' As the curative response in the index patient occurred in the setting of combined inhibition of topoisomerase 1 and the DNA damage checkpoint pathway	 we assessed whether checkpoint inhibition was synergistic with rad50L1240F in the presence of CPT by examining drug sensitivity in a rad50L1240F mutant in which Mec1 was ablated. MEC1 is the yeast counterpart of the human ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related) gene	 and is the major regulator of DDR in budding yeast (9). Therefore	 an analysis of rad50L1240F mec1Î” double mutants is a surrogate of AZD7762 treatment in the patient. Whereas rad50L1240F cells exhibited only mild CPT sensitivity in a checkpoint-competent background	 the rad50L1240F mec1Î” double mutants were at least 500-fold more sensitive to CPT than either of the single mutants (Fig. 3B). Other D-loop mutants exhibited variable CPT sensitivity	 with rad50Q1262K sharing a pattern similar to L1240F whereas rad50D1241N was as sensitive as rad50Î” cells. These results indicate that L1237F-mutant cells are strongly dependent on the remaining intact checkpoint pathway for survival upon DNA damage by topoisomerase 1 inhibition. This synthetic lethal interaction likely accounts for the apparent hypersensitivity of the index patientâ€™s RAD50 L1237F-mutant cells to co-treatment with irinotecan AZD7762.' ' ' ' As the Mre11 complex also regulates the DDR kinase ATM	 we next assessed the functional status of Tel1 (the yeast ATM ortholog and Mec1 paralogue) in rad50 mutants. In mec1Î” sae2Î” mutants	 cells that are only able to respond to DNA damage through Tel1 via a functional Mre11 complex (see Supplementary Note) (10	 11)	 rad50L1240F triple mutant cells had a sensitivity to both CPT and the DNA damaging agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) equal to that of rad50-mutant mec1Î” alone	 indicating defective activation of Tel1 in Rad50 D-loop-mutant cells (Fig. 3B	 Supplementary Fig. 7). Next	 we examined DNA damage-dependent activation of Rad53	 which as a downstream substrate of Tel1 analogous to human Chk2	 can only be activated by Tel1 in the absence of Mec1. While MMS treatment induced Rad53 phosphorylation levels in wildtype cells	 and while some additional Rad53 stimulation is apparent upon Sae2 loss	 sae2Î” cannot rescue Rad53 phosphorylation levels in any of the rad50 mutants tested (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. 8). This attenuation of Rad53 phosphorylation levels in the triple mutants confirms that Tel1 (ATM) signaling is defective in the Rad50-mutant cells.' ' ' ' As Tel1 kinase activity is important for telomere maintenance	 we assessed the impact of this molecular phenotype on telomere length in the rad50 mutants. As in previous studies that showed significantly shorter telomeres resulting from tel1Î” and Tel1 kinase-dead strains (12)	 we also witnessed shorter telomeres in the rad50 mutant cells (Supplementary Fig. 9). This observation	 along with the defect in Rad53 phosphorylation in Mec1-deficient cells	 suggests that ATM activation was compromised in the RAD50 L1237F index responder. In sum	 the results suggest that the marked sensitivity of the RAD50 L1237F-mutant tumor to irinotecan was due at least in part to simultaneous inhibition of both the ATR (by AZD7762) and ATM (by RAD50 L1237F) axes of the DDR.' ' ' ' We further recapitulated these findings in mammalian cells. We engineered mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) in which the sole source of Rad50 was Rad50 L1237F. Upon treatment with the Chk1 inhibitor and CPT	 these cells had reduced phosphorylation of the substrate Kap1 at Ser824	 an ATM-dependent site (Supplementary Fig. 10A). Consequently	 these cells have reduced Î³H2AX formation following irradiation (Supplementary Fig. 10B)	 confirming the ATM signaling defect. Moreover	 while colony formation was reduced significantly upon irinotecan treatment irrespective of genotype	 this was greatest upon co-treatment with the Chk1 inhibitor in Rad50 L1237F cells (Supplementary Fig. 10C).' ' ' ' Go to:' ' DISCUSSION' ' In summary	 we find that a hypomorphic mutation in RAD50 accompanied by LOH identified by WGS of an extreme outlier responder likely contributed to a complete and durable response to irinotecan in combination with a selective inhibitor of Chk1. The RAD50 L1237F mutant was both clonal and arose early	 suggesting that RAD50 dysfunction may have contributed to tumor initiation	 perhaps in combination with mutant p53	 by potentiating the profound structural remodeling of this patientâ€™s tumor genome. While our functional results indicate that RAD50 L1237F confers dramatically enhanced sensitivity to the combination of irinotecan and Chk1 inhibition	 additional factors may have contributed to the profound and durable response observed. For example	 the clonal nature of this responderâ€™s tumor	 with 95.1% of all somatic mutations identified present in the dominant tumor clone (Supplementary Fig. 3)	 may have contributed to the depth and durability of the response. It has been suggested that extensive subclonal mutations in treatment-naÃ¯ve patients are associated with a shorter time to relapse and a worse outcome (13). The limited subclonal structure of this patientâ€™s tumor may	 therefore	 have resulted in a less tolerant environment for the selection and outgrowth of a pre-existing resistant clone. This may have been especially true given the dose-dense weekly cytotoxic treatment regimen used	 which may not have allowed the tumor sufficient time to adapt a fitter and more resistant clone.' ' ' ' In addition to demonstrating the indispensability of the D-loop of RAD50 for proper ATM activation and downstream checkpoint signaling (Fig. 3D)	 the hypomorphic nature of the RAD50 L1237F allele is noteworthy. Whereas the somatic mutation was defective	 innocuous D-loop alanine substitutions (rad50L1240A and rad50D1241A) had only a very mild impact	 despite these residues being so highly conserved. Thus	 there is considerable plasticity in the D-loop sequence that produces a narrow solution space in which RAD50 hypomorphism can be achieved through somatic mutation. This illustrates the potential importance of functional rather than fully inactivating mutations of highly conserved components of essential cellular systems like the DDR to various malignant phenotypes including treatment sensitivity.' ' ' ' While D-loop mutations in Rad50 have been studied previously (5	 14)	 our phenotypic characterization of the somatic RAD50 L1237F allele revealed new insights into RAD50 function that may be exploited therapeutically. Whereas RAD50 mutation produced a negligible DSB repair defect	 ATM activation was severely impaired. This resulted in marked synergy with inhibition of the ATR-Chk1 axis of the DDR in the setting of co-treatment with a DNA damage-inducing cytotoxic chemotherapy (Fig. 3E). These data suggest a tumor-specific combination therapy strategy whereby checkpoint inhibition in combination with DNA damaging chemotherapy is synthetically lethal in tumor but not normal cells with somatic mutations impairing Mre11 complex function. Indeed	 as we found Mre11 complex mutations along with those in ATM to be present in a significant minority of patients across diverse human cancer types (Supplementary Table 5)	 these data argue for the development of inhibitors of checkpoint control generally and also targeted inhibitors of the Mre11 complex specifically or its synthetic lethal partners (such as ATM). As suggest by prior studies	 this combinatorial approach may prove particularly effective in p53-mutant patients	 as was the case in the index patient described here (15). This synthetic lethality is thus analogous to the use of PARP inhibitors in patients with BRCA1/2 mutations and highlights the potential utility of targeting DNA repair pathways in combination with mutagenic chemotherapies in patients who have a tumor-restricted defect in DDR. Finally	 this work highlights that the value of whole genome analyses of extreme outlier phenotypes is not limited to targeted therapeutics or the discovery of biomarkers of clinical benefit. Rather	 analyses of exceptional responses can reveal new facets of pathway biology that suggest rational polytherapeutic strategies to interdict in a manner that extends profound	 life-altering activity to molecularly defined patient populations.' ' ' ' Go to:' ' METHODS' ' Clinical presentation and phase I trial' ' ' ' A 47-year-old woman presented with severe flank pain and gross hematuria. Computed tomography (CT) identified a lesion in the right ureter	 which biopsy confirmed was an invasive poorly differentiated carcinoma with small cell features (Supplementary Fig. 1). She underwent a distal right ureterectomy that showed high-grade small cell carcinoma with local invasion and lymph node metastasis (pT3N1). She was treated with six cycles of etoposide and cisplatin chemotherapy but four months later CT indicated a recurrent infiltrative soft-tissue mass within her right kidney and increasing retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. At that time	 she underwent a right nephroureterectomy with retroperitoneal lymph node dissection from which a recurrent small cell carcinoma was confirmed with invasion into the renal hilar fat and parenchyma with 2 of 16 positive retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Subsequent imaging indicated an enlarging retrocaval lymph node and a new left iliac bone metastasis. The patient was then enrolled in an open-label phase-I multi-center dose escalation study of AZD7762	 an ATP-competitive checkpoint kinase inhibitor	 and weekly irinotecan (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00473616) (1). This combination therapy was based on preclinical evidence that AZD7762	 a potent inhibitor of Chk1 and Chk2	 abrogates the G2/M checkpoint induced by SN-38	 the active metabolite of irinotecan	 resulting in enhanced DNA damage and cancer cell death (15). Within one month of treatment initiation	 CT indicated a greater than 50% reduction in lymph nodes and evolving sclerosis of bone metastasis suggesting response. Within 8 cycles of therapy	 this evolved into a complete response. She continued on AZD7762 in combination with irinotecan until trial termination (December 2010) and irinotecan alone until June 2011. As she had remained without evidence of disease for 1.5 years	 chemotherapy was discontinued. At present	 the patient remains free of disease. This patient was the only one of 68 trial participants to achieve a complete response.

1	74||Mre11	 Rad50	 and Nbs1 function in a protein complex that is central to the metabolism of chromosome breaks. Null mutants of each are inviable. We demonstrate here that hypomorphic Rad50 mutant mice (Rad50S/S mice) exhibited growth defects and cancer predisposition. Rad50S/S mice died with complete bone marrow depletion as a result of progressive hematopoietic stem cell failure. Similar attrition occurred in spermatogenic cells. In both contexts	 attrition was substantially mitigated by p53 deficiency	 whereas the tumor latency of p53âˆ’/âˆ’ and p53+/âˆ’ animals was reduced by Rad50S/S. Indices of genotoxic stress and chromosomal rearrangements were evident in Rad50S/S cultured cells	 as well as in Rad50S/S and p53âˆ’/âˆ’Rad50S/S lymphomas	 suggesting that the Rad50S/S phenotype was attributable to chromosomal instability. These outcomes were not associated with overt defects in the Mre11 complex's previously established double strand break repair and cell cycle checkpoint regulation functions. The data indicate that even subtle perturbation of Mre11 complex functions results in severe genotoxic stress	 and that the complex is critically important for homeostasis of proliferative tissues.  Keywords: Mre11 complex	 Rad50S	 double strand breaks	 hematopoiesis The Mre11 complex	 consisting of the highly conserved Mre11 and Rad50 proteins and Nbs1 (or Xrs2 in yeast)	 mediates diverse functions in double strand break (DSB) metabolism. In both mammals and Saccharomyces cerevisiae	 the complex functions as a sensor of DSBs and influences the induction of DNA damage-dependent cell cycle checkpoints (Petrini 2000a; D'Amours and Jackson 2001; Grenon et al. 2001; Mirzoeva and Petrini 2001; Usui et al. 2001). Mre11 complex deficiency in S. cerevisiae profoundly impairs recombinational DNA repair as well as telomere maintenance and meiotic recombination (Haber 1998). In vertebrates	 null mutants in each member of the Mre11 complex are inviable (Xiao and Weaver 1997; Luo et al. 1999; Yamaguchi-Iwai et al. 1999; Zhu et al. 2001).  The Mre11 complex specifies ssDNA endonuclease	 3â€²-to-5â€² exonuclease	 and DNA unwinding activities in vitro. Accordingly	 it has been implicated in DNA end processing events in vivo. Spo11	 the topoisomerase II-like enzyme that forms DSBs to initiate meiotic recombination	 remains bound to the DSB termini in a group of hypomorphic RAD50 and MRE11 mutants	 called S mutants (Alani et al. 1990; Usui et al. 1998). This suggests that the Spo11-DNA intermediate is cleaved by the Mre11 complex in wild-type cells.  In addition	 rad50S and nuclease-deficient mre11 mutants are inviable in the absence of Rad27	 a nuclease required for the completion of lagging strand DNA synthesis	 raising the possibility that the Mre11 complex participates in the nucleolytic processing of DNA replication intermediates (Harrington and Lieber 1994; Moreau et al. 1999; Debrauwere et al. 2001). It appears that Mre11 complex nuclease activities are not critical to its DSB repair functions because rad50S	 mre11S	 and nuclease-deficient mre11 mutants exhibit only minor sensitivity to clastogens	 and resection of DSBs generated by the HO endonuclease is normal (Alani et al. 1990; Nairz and Klein 1997; Bressan et al. 1998	 1999; Tsubouchi and Ogawa 1998; Usui et al. 1998; Moreau et al. 1999; Lee et al. 2002).  As suggested by the functional interaction with Rad27	 the Mre11 complex appears to be particularly important during DNA replication (Petrini 2000b). Î³-irradiation of synchronous cultures revealed that the extreme clastogen sensitivity of S. cerevisiae mre11Î” mutants is largely attributable to the inability of those cells to utilize sister chromatids in DNA repair	 and that this effect is most pronounced in S phase (Ivanov et al. 1992; Bressan et al. 1999). Further	 SbcCD	 the bacterial Mre11 complex ortholog	 appears to be required for processing aberrant DNA structures that arise at replication forks (Leach 1994; Connelly et al. 1998). In bacteriophage T4	 recombination-dependent DNA replication and restart of stalled replication forks requires gp46/47	 the T4 orthologs of Mre11/Rad50 (George et al. 2001; Stohr and Kreuzer 2001).  Several lines of evidence support a similar role for the Mre11 complex in vertebrates. First	 Mre11-depleted DT40 chicken cells die with chromosomal damage suggestive of failure to resolve DSBs arising during DNA replication (Yamaguchi-Iwai et al. 1999). Second	 DNA replication in Mre11-depleted Xenopus laevis extracts is associated with the accumulation of chromosome breaks (Costanzo et al. 2001). Finally	 the human Mre11 complex becomes avidly associated with chromatin during S phase (Maser et al. 2001). These studies underscore the role of the Mre11 complex in DNA replication	 and define a likely basis for the inviability of Mre11 complex-deficient vertebrate cells.  Mre11 complex functions at telomeres may also account for the inviability of Mre11 complex-deficient mammalian cells. The complex functions at telomeres in S. cerevisiae as well as in mammals	 although the extent to which Mre11 complex telomere functions are conserved in yeast and mammalian cells is unknown. The human Mre11 complex is situated at telomeres via physical association with the telomere protection protein	 TRF2 (Zhu et al. 2000). Given its association with TRF2	 the Mre11 complex may function in telomere protection	 and would be required for cellular viability via a role in preventing telomere failure (de Lange and Petrini 2000; Lombard and Guarente 2000; Zhu et al. 2000).  In this study	 mice harboring a Rad50 allele analogous to the S. cerevisiae rad50S allele rad50-R20M (Alani et al. 1990) were derived. Rad50S/S mice were viable	 but exhibited partial embryonic lethality	 growth defects	 and cancer predisposition. These pathologic outcomes were associated with progressive failure of Rad50S/S hematopoietic and germline cells which was partially mitigated by p53 deficiency. Primary and transformed cell cultures and tumor lines established from Rad50S/S mice were characterized by increased spontaneous apoptosis and chromosomal instability. We conclude that this effect of the Rad50K22M allele constitutes the mechanistic basis of hematopoietic and spermatogenic depletion in Rad50S/S mice. These findings underscore the importance of the Mre11 complex for maintenance of chromosome stability and in homeostasis of proliferative tissues.  Go to: Results Derivation of Rad50S/Sâ€‰mice  Null Rad50 mutations were lethal at the cellular and organismal levels	 precluding conventional gene inactivation as a means to analyze the Mre11 complex in vivo (Luo et al. 1999). Three hypomorphic Rad50 mutants	 Rad50K6E	 Rad50K22M	 and Rad50R83I	 corresponding to S. cerevisiae rad50S alleles were tested for their ability to support cell viability. mRad50Brdm1/mRad50Brdc1 embryonic stem (ES) cells harbor a null Rad50 allele (mRad50Brdm1) and a Rad50 allele that is inactivated upon expression of Cre recombinase (mRad50Brdc1). Because Rad50 is required for viability	 Cre expression in mRad50Brdm1/mRad50Brdc1 cells is lethal unless a functional Rad50 cDNA is ectopically expressed (Luo et al. 1999). These cells were cotransfected with a Cre expression vector (pPGKhygro-Cre) and a wild-type or Rad50S cDNA expression construct. Wild-type and pRad50K22M	 but not pRad50R83I or pRad50K6E	 were sufficient for viability. On this basis	 the Rad50K22M mutation	 which corresponds to the rad50S allele rad50-R20M in yeast (Alani et al. 1990)	 was chosen for the derivation of mutant mice.  pkin-24ploxp contains exons 1	2	 and 3 of the Rad50 locus with an AAG to ATG change in exon 1	 resulting in Kâ†’M at amino acid residue 22 (Fig. (Fig.1A;1A; Dolganov et al. 1996). Homologous integration of pkin-24ploxp in ES cells was assessed by Southern blotting (Fig. (Fig.1B)	1B)	 and the ensuing targeted ES cells were used to derive mutant animals. Rad50S/S mice were susceptible to partial embryonic lethality at embryonic day 14â€“16 (E14â€“E16; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.002)	 and were significantly underrepresented among 3-wk-old animals (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.00001). These data indicated that the Rad50K22Mallele is hypomorphic.  Figure 1Figure 1 Figure 1 Derivation of Rad50K22M mutants. (A) Schematic of Rad50 locus. 5â€² region and exons 1â€“3 (black boxes) are shown. Homologous integration of the targeting vector pk-in-24ploxp with the K22M mutation encoded in exon 1 (*) inserts a loxP-flanked ... Rad50S/S MEFs were not sensitive to ionizing radiation (IR)	 mitomycin C	 hydroxyurea	 or etoposide	 nor did they exhibit growth defects. The formation of Mre11 IR-induced foci (IRIF) and the intra-S phase checkpoint were also unaffected (data not shown). In addition	 wild-type levels of Mre11	 Nbs1	 and Rad50SK22M protein were present in extracts of Rad50S/S murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)	 and their ability to assemble in complex was not overtly affected (Fig. (Fig.11C).  Although the Rad50K22M allele exerted a minimal cellular phenotype	 it had a profound impact at the organismal level. Rad50S/S mice weighed 60% of wild-type littermates	 and by 4â€“8 wk of age	 most Rad50S/S animals had a gray	 wasted appearance suggestive of anemia. The mean age of death of Rad50S/S mice was 2.6â€‰Â±â€‰1.8 mo (Nâ€‰=â€‰166). Whereas most Rad50S/S mice died tumor-free by 4 mo of age	 20% survived 4â€“7 mo. In this group of long-lived Rad50S/S mice	 20% died with metastatic thymic lymphomas	 four exhibited splenic hyperplasia	 and one mouse developed myeloid leukemia.  Meiotic progression in Rad50S/Sâ€‰mice  In S. cerevisiae rad50S mutants	 meiotic DSBs are not processed due to the covalent attachment of Spo11 (Alani et al. 1990; Keeney and Kleckner 1995; Keeney et al. 1997). Because the function of Spo11 appears to be conserved in mice (Baudat et al. 2000; Romanienko and Camerini-Otero 2000)	 we analyzed Rad50S/S ovaries and testes to determine whether murine Rad50K22M led to an analogous block in meiotic progression.  Rad50S/S females were fertile and had normal ovaries (not shown). Testicular development was normal in prepubescent Rad50S/S males. Despite decreased cellularity in the seminiferous tubules of 4-wk-old Rad50S/S mice (Fig. (Fig.2A)	2A)	 older mice were also fertile.  Figure 2Figure 2Figure 2 Figure 2 Progressive degeneration in Rad50S/S testes is not associated with meiotic recombination defects. (A) Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of testes sections from 2- and 4-wk-old Rad50+/+ and Rad50S/S mice. Bar	 100 Î¼m; ... Meiotic recombination defects in Spo11âˆ’/âˆ’ mice result in depletion of germ cell precursors (Baudat et al. 2000; Romanienko and Camerini-Otero 2000). We reasoned that the cellular attrition in Rad50S/S testes might be the result of a similar	 though less severe meiotic defect. TUNEL analysis of 4-wk-old Rad50S/S testes	 unlike those from 2-wk-old Rad50S/S mice	 revealed a 3â€“5-fold increase in the number of apoptotic tubules (Fig. (Fig.2B).2B). However	 cytologic analysis of meiotic progression did not indicate a stage-specific arrest	 nor were aberrant chromosomal structures noted (Fig. (Fig.2C).2C). These data suggest that the Rad50K22M allele did not impair meiotic recombination	 and that cell death in Rad50S/S testes is attributable to a different source of genotoxic stress.  Hematopoietic stem cell failure in Rad50S/Sâ€‰mice  The premature death of Rad50S/S mice was associated with severe anemia. Two-wk-old Rad50S/S mice did not exhibit differences in the abundance of hematopoietic cells. However	 by 4â€“8 wk of age	 the bone marrow of most Rad50S/S mice was virtually devoid of hematopoietic cells and was largely composed of adipocytes (Fig. (Fig.3A).3A). Spleen and thymus architecture was also grossly abnormal	 with few lymphocytes present (data not shown). Long-lived Rad50S/S mice that did not develop thymic lymphomas died with bone marrow attrition identical to that seen in 4â€“8-wk-old mutants.  Figure 3Figure 3Figure 3 Figure 3 Rad50S/S progressive hematopoietic depletion is intrinsic to stem cells. (A) H&E staining of bone marrow sections from Rad50+/+ and Rad50S/S. Bar	 100 Î¼m; magnification	 400Ã—. (B) FACS analysis of hematopoietic ... Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis was used to correlate abundance of hematopoietic components with age. Double negative (CD4âˆ’	CD8âˆ’	 DN) T cells	 pro B cells (B220+	CD43+)	 and macrophages (B220âˆ’	CD43+) were present at wild-type levels in E16 Rad50S/S embryos (Fig. (Fig.3B).3B). By 1 wk of age	 pre B (B220+	CD43âˆ’) and immature B (B220+	IgM+) cells in Rad50S/S mice were 1.5â€“3-fold reduced	 whereas pro B cells and macrophages were 2â€“3-fold increased. Thymocytes were unaffected at this age	 but splenic B and T cells were decreased to 4.8%â€“12% and 7%â€“49% of wild-type	 respectively (Fig. (Fig.3B;3B; data not shown). By 4 wk of age	 lymphocytes	 macrophages	 red blood cells and platelets were severely depleted (0.1%â€“18% wild-type	 Fig. Fig.3B	3B	 data not shown). These results demonstrated that progressive hematopoietic failure in Rad50S/S mice affected all hematopoietic lineages.  Cell transfer experiments were performed to determine whether Rad50S/S pathology was intrinsic to hematopoietic cells. Irradiated Rad50S/S mice were injected with wild-type fetal liver cells to assess the ability of Rad50S/S bone marrow stroma to support hematopoietic differentiation. Reconstitution of hematopoietic cells in Rad50S/S recipients of wild-type fetal liver was comparable to that in control recipients (Fig. (Fig.3C).3C). PCR-based genotyping confirmed that wild-type cells were responsible for reconstitution of Rad50S/S mice (data not shown). In contrast	 wild-type recipients of Rad50S/S fetal liver had 10â€“1000-fold fewer hematopoietic cells than controls at 6 wk after transfer (Fig. (Fig.3C).3C). These data suggested that Rad50S/S bone marrow failure was attributable to hematopoietic failure independent of stromal defects.  To confirm that interpretation	 we mixed wild-type and Rad50S/S fetal liver cells in a 1:1 ratio and transferred them into wild-type recipients. In this setting	 Rad50S/S cells would be supported by the wild-type hematopoietic milieu during differentiation. Full reconstitution was evident 4 wk after transfer	 and genotypic analysis showed that wild-type	 but not Rad50S/S cells	 were present in hematopoietic tissues of reconstituted animals (Fig. (Fig.3C;3C; data not shown). Thus	 the presence of wild-type hematopoietic cells and stroma did not increase the ability of Rad50S/S stem cells to reconstitute hematopoietic compartments. These experiments indicated that progressive bone marrow depletion in Rad50S/S mice was primarily attributable to hematopoietic stem cell failure.  Normal V(D)J recombination in Rad50S/Sâ€‰mice  DNA hairpins are intermediates in the site-specific recombination process required for antigen receptor gene assembly	 V(D)J recombination (Roth et al. 1992; McBlane et al. 1995). Recent in vitro experiments suggest that the artemis/DNAPK complex may open V(D)J hairpins (Ma et al. 2002). However	 in light of in vitro and in vivo data	 the possibility remains that the Mre11 complex may also influence this process (Paull and Gellert 1998	 1999; Lobachev et al. 2002). We used ligation-mediated PCR to assess whether hairpin opening was defective in Rad50S/S mice (Zhu and Roth 1995). TCR DÎ´2 hairpins were readily detected in thymus DNA from 1-wk-old scid mice; however none were detected in Rad50S/S samples (Fig. (Fig.4).4).  Figure 4 Figure 4 Normal hairpin resolution in Rad50S/S thymocytes. Hairpin coding ends (CE)	 oligonucleotides were ligated to the D2/J1 blunt signal ends (SE) and the open CEs. Ends were PCR amplified using DÎ´2â€“ and oligospecific primers (arrows)	 and ... Quantitative PCR showed that in vivo V to DJ and D to J rearrangement frequencies	 as well as the structure of the joints formed	 were normal in E16 and in 4-wk-old Rad50S/S mice (data not shown). Transient V(D)J recombination assays indicated that coding and signal joints were formed at comparable frequencies in wild-type and Rad50S/S MEFs (recombination frequency for signal joints: 0.12% in wild-type	 0.29% in Rad50S/S; coding joints: 0.5% in wild-type	 1.2% in Rad50S/S)	 and like Rad50S/S in vivo joints	 did not exhibit abnormal structures (data not shown). These data indicate that V(D)J recombination was normal in Rad50S/S mice	 and suggest that hairpin opening during V(D)J recombination is not impaired by the Rad50K22M mutation.  p53 deficiency mitigates the Rad50S/Sâ€‰phenotype  The correlation of age with malignancy	 together with the observation that testes and bone marrow showed age-dependent cellular attrition	 suggested that the Rad50K22M mutation caused chronic genotoxic stress. Because p53 profoundly influences genotoxic stress responses (Prives and Hall 1999)	 we hypothesized that p53 deficiency would mitigate the Rad50S/S phenotype. Conversely	 because potentially oncogenic genetic alterations would accumulate without inducing apoptosis in p53-deficient Rad50S/S mice	 we expected Rad50S to reduce the tumor latency of p53âˆ’/âˆ’ animals.  Indeed	 reduced p53 dosage partially rescued Rad50S-dependent depletion in the hematopoietic compartment	 and the Rad50K22M mutation accelerated p53+/âˆ’ and p53âˆ’/âˆ’ tumorigenesis (Fig. (Fig.5A	B).5A	B). B cell numbers were increased 3â€“10-fold and 5â€“20-fold above Rad50S/S levels in p53+/âˆ’ Rad50S/S and p53âˆ’/âˆ’ Rad50S/S mice	 respectively. Macrophages were threefold increased and T cells were 3â€“20-fold increased in both p53+/âˆ’ Rad50S/S and p53âˆ’/âˆ’ Rad50S/S mice (cf. Figs. Figs.3B3B and and5A).5A). The partial rescue of hematopoietic cell survival in p53+/âˆ’ Rad50S/S and p53âˆ’/âˆ’ Rad50S/S mice was associated with increased lifespan (Fig. (Fig.5B).5B). Rad50K22M significantly altered p53+/âˆ’ and p53âˆ’/âˆ’ tumor susceptibility. p53+/âˆ’ control mice in our colony developed osteosarcomas after 12 mo of age (Nâ€‰=â€‰34)	 whereas p53+/âˆ’ Rad50S/S mice died from thymic lymphomas at an average of 5 mo (Nâ€‰=â€‰17; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.002). p53âˆ’/âˆ’ Rad50S/S animals (Nâ€‰=â€‰7	 average age of death 3.3 mo; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.05) died earlier than p53âˆ’/âˆ’ mice (Nâ€‰=â€‰17	 average age of death 4.5 mo) without changes in p53âˆ’/âˆ’ tumor spectrum (Jacks et al. 1994). In contrast to Rad50S/S animals	 the double mutants succumbed to lymphoma and did not show overt signs of anemia.  Figure 5Figure 5Figure 5 Figure 5 p53 deficiency partially rescues the Rad50S/S phenotype. (A) FACS analysis of 4-wk-old 129/SvEv Rad50+/+ (â—‹)	 p53+/âˆ’ Rad50S/S (â–´)	 and p53âˆ’/âˆ’Rad50S/S (â–ª) mice; depicted as in Fig. ... p53 deficiency also suppressed the attrition of cells in the seminiferous tubules	 correlated with abrogation of testicular apoptosis in both p53+/âˆ’ Rad50S/S and p53âˆ’/âˆ’ Rad50S/S mice (Fig. (Fig.5C).5C). The suppression of testicular apoptosis raised the possibility that defects in meiotic recombination	 obscured by apoptotic attrition in p53-proficient cells	 would be evident in double mutants. However	 p53+/âˆ’ Rad50S/S and p53âˆ’/âˆ’ Rad50S/S males did not exhibit an arrest in meiotic progression	 nor were aberrant chromosomal structures detected (data not shown). These data indicate that apoptosis in Rad50S/S testes was not associated with meiotic recombination defects.  Chronic genotoxic stress in cells from Rad50S/Sâ€‰mice  The rescue of Rad50S/S hematopoietic and testicular attrition and the reduced tumor latency in p53+/âˆ’ Rad50S/S and p53âˆ’/âˆ’ Rad50S/S mice supported the interpretation that chronic genotoxic stress was the underlying cause of the Rad50S/S phenotype. Indices of genotoxic stress were assessed in primary cell cultures. First	 the apoptotic indices of wild-type and Rad50S/S MEFs were analyzed by FACS. Compared to wild-type controls	 unirradiated Rad50S/S MEFs exhibited a 1.4â€“3.4-fold increase in the fraction of cells with sub-G1 DNA content. A similar increase in annexinV staining was also found in unirradiated Rad50S/S MEFs. The increase in apoptotic cells after irradiation (IR) was similar in Rad50S/S and control cells	 indicating that the apoptotic response to IR was not compromised (Table (Table1).1).  Table 1 Table 1 Genotoxic stress in Rad50S/Sâ€‰cells Second	 the presence of phosphorylated histone H2AX (Î³-H2AX)	 which is correlated with the presence of DNA damage (Rogakou et al. 1999; Paull et al. 2000; Ward and Chen 2001)	 was examined in MEFs by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry with Î³-H2AX antiserum. The percentage of Î³-H2AX-positive cells was increased in unirradiated Rad50S/S cells to levels comparable to that in wild-type irradiated cells (Table (Table11).  Finally	 since the mammalian Mre11 complex localizes to sites of DNA replication (Maser et al. 2001)	 sites of DNA damage (Nelms et al. 1998; Mirzoeva and Petrini 2001)	 and to human telomeres (Zhu et al. 2000)	 we reasoned that attenuation of Mre11 complex function at any one of these venues could induce chromosome aberrations in Rad50S/S cells. To address this possibility	 spectral karyotype (SKY) and conventional karyotypic analyses were performed. Increased levels of chromosome breaks were evident in ear fibroblast cultures established from Rad50S/S and p53âˆ’/âˆ’ Rad50S/S mice (Table (Table2;2; Fig. Fig.6A).6A). Increases in chromosome breaks and rearrangements were also detected in SV40-transformed Rad50S/S ear fibroblasts by conventional analysis of Giemsa-stained metaphase cells (Table (Table2).2). These data were consistent with the interpretation that the Rad50K22M mutation exerted an impact on chromosome stability.  Table 2 Table 2 Karyotypic analysis of ear fibroblastâ€‰cultures Figure 6Figure 6Figure 6 Figure 6 Chromosome instability in Rad50S/S cells. (A) Images of Giemsa-stained metaphase cells. (Left) a normal metaphase spread from a Rad50S/S ear fibroblast. (Right) Rad50S/S ear fibroblast metaphase with one broken chromosome (arrow). Magnification	 1000Ã—. ... Because the events that lead to depletion of hematopoietic cells also predispose malignancy	 the mechanistic basis of Rad50S/S pathology should be evident in tumors from these mice. Rad50S/S and p53âˆ’/âˆ’ Rad50S/S thymic lymphoma cells exhibited increased chromosomal instability in SKY analysis (Table (Table3;3; Fig. Fig.6B).6B). Compared to p53âˆ’/âˆ’ tumors	 most Rad50S/S and p53âˆ’/âˆ’ Rad50S/S tumors had more chromosome rearrangements and some exhibited an increased frequency of nonclonal karyotypes	 suggesting that events leading to instability were ongoing (Table (Table3).3).  Table 3 Table 3 Spectral karyotype analysis of thymicâ€‰lymphomas Giemsa-stained chromosomes from tumors revealed similar karyotypic instability. Notable was a significant increase in short-arm chromosome fusions (Table (Table4).4). Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with a CCCTAA probe was performed to determine whether fusions in Rad50S/S cells resulted from joining of telomeric or interstitial DNA. The majority of short-arm fusions in Rad50S/S and p53âˆ’/âˆ’ Rad50S/S tumors contained two intense telomeric signals at the join	 indicating that telomeric DNA was retained in these fusions (Fig. (Fig.6C).6C). Fusions containing telomeric DNA were detected by FISH in all Rad50S/S and p53âˆ’/âˆ’ Rad50S/S tumors	 but not in p53âˆ’/âˆ’ tumors (Table (Table4).4). These data raise the possibility that telomere failure was among the chromosomal phenotypes associated with the Rad50K22M mutation	 and collectively support the interpretation that Rad50S/S cells are subject to chronic genotoxic stress.  Table 4 Table 4 Chromosome aberrations in thymicâ€‰lymphomasa Go to: Discussion The Mre11 complex is integral to a diverse spectrum of functions that bear upon chromosome stability. Genetic analyses in S. cerevisiae establish that the complex's influence can be generally attributed to either structural roles	 which primarily influence the DNA recombination functions of the complex	 or enzymatic (nucleolytic) roles	 which appear to influence DSB end processing or degradation of certain DNA structures. The complex's structural role has been invoked to account for the inability of null Mre11 complex mutants to utilize sister chromatids during recombinational DNA repair	 whereas nuclease-deficient mutants do not exhibit this property (Ivanov et al. 1992; Moore and Haber 1996; Bressan et al. 1999). A molecular basis for such a role is suggested by electron microscopic studies of the human Mre11 complex and structural analysis of the Pyrococcus furiosis Mre11 complex. Those data indicate that the complex may bridge DNA ends or sister chromatids via the coiled coil regions of Rad50 (de Jager et al. 2001; Hopfner et al. 2002). The in vivo role of the complex's nuclease functions have been inferred from the S. cerevisiae S alleles	 in which the initial processing of meiotic DSBs is impaired	 and from the synthetic lethality of nuclease-deficient mutants with Rad27 deficiency (Symington 1998; Debrauwere et al. 2001).  We determined previously that a null Rad50 mouse mutant	 in which the structural role of the Mre11 complex is presumably abrogated	 is inviable (Luo et al. 1999). Therefore	 we established a Rad50S/S mouse mutant in which the Mre11 complex is intact	 but functionally hypomorphic. In contrast to Rad50-deficient mice	 Rad50S/S mice exhibit only partial embryonic lethality. Rad50S/S mice have shortened lifespan associated with progressive loss of cells in the male germ line and in hematopoietic lineages	 and die with hematopoietic failure by 3 mo of age. Sporadically appearing longer-lived Rad50S/S animals are highly predisposed to malignancy. Underlying these phenotypic outcomes is the accumulation of chromosome aberrations. In p53-proficient mice	 these events precipitate the cellular attrition observed	 whereas in the context of p53 deficiency	 abrogation of apoptosis diminishes cellular attrition but dramatically enhances tumorigenesis.  Progressive attrition of hematopoietic and spermatogenic lineages in Rad50S/Sâ€‰mice  Rad50S/S pathology is largely restricted to hematopoietic and germ cell lineages. Fetal liver cell transfer experiments demonstrated that the progressive hematopoietic failure observed is correlated with depletion of stem cells. An analogous progenitor depletion may underlie the progressive attrition of cells in the seminiferous tubules	 because meiotic progression is not impaired by Rad50S. In this regard	 the Rad50S/S mice are similar to late-generation telomerase-deficient (mTRâˆ’/âˆ’) mice	 which experience telomere failure as a sequela to telomere shortening	 and exhibit relatively selective depletion of hematopoietic and spermatogenic cells (Lee et al. 1998; Herrera et al. 1999).  Chronic genotoxic stress associated with the Rad50K22M allele would differentially affect hematopoietic and spermatogenic tissues for two reasons. First	 in contrast to other proliferative tissues such as intestine or skin	 they arise from extensive proliferation of a relatively small number of stem cells and committed precursors (Weissman 2000). Therefore	 for each stem or precursor cell depleted	 a relatively large proportion of the tissueâ€”arising from geometric expansion from the depleted stem cellâ€”would be lost. Second	 decreased cellularity	 as a primary outcome of stem cell depletion and the ensuing reduction in differentiated cells	 imposes increased proliferative demand on the residual population. Whereas mutations that result in gross chromosomal instability would have broad pathological outcomes	 less severe mutations would more specifically affect tissues that rely upon limited precursor populations.  The selective effect of Rad50K22M on hematopoietic and spermatogenic tissue is thus consistent with the observation that the magnitude of chromosomal instability in Rad50S/S mice was relatively low. The chromosomal aberrations seen in Rad50S/S and p53âˆ’/âˆ’ Rad50S/S lymphomas were not seen in p53âˆ’/âˆ’ tumors	 and were largely clonal	 indicating that these chromosomal aberrations are unique to the Rad50K22M allele	 and further	 that they accumulate at a relatively low rate. Were Rad50S/S mice longer-lived	 a broader spectrum of pathology would likely emerge. By analogy	 whereas hematopoietic and spermatogenic depletion are seen first in late-generation mTRâˆ’/âˆ’ mice	 an aged cohort of these mice exhibited much broader pathology	 including skin and intestine defects (Herrera et al. 1999; Rudolph et al. 1999).  Murine Rad50S alleles  The inability of Rad50K6E and Rad50R83I to support cell viability was not predicted from the behavior of the corresponding S. cerevisiae mutants. Given the conservation of Mre11 and Rad50	 it is unlikely that the enzymatic functions impaired by the murine S mutations differ from those in S. cerevisiae. Assuming that the three S mutations examined impair the same functions	 the inviability of Rad50K6E and Rad50R83I could simply reflect a more severe form of the Rad50K22M phenotype	 in which cell death ensues from greater increase in the levels of chromosome instability. It is also conceivable that increased severity could result from defects in processing a more diverse spectrum of substrates in Rad50K6E- and Rad50R83I-expressing cells.  The lack of meiotic recombination and V(D)J recombination defects in Rad50K22M mutants	 which was also unexpected	 could be explained by the same argument. S mutations that exert a profound effect on meiotic progression would be inviable. Although a meiotic arrest was not clearly evident in the Rad50K22M mice	 a subtle defect might not have been detected by our analysis.  The Mre11 complex: Diverse mechanisms in maintaining genomicâ€‰integrity  Mutations in MRE11 and NBS1 are associated with cancer predisposition	 chromosome instability	 and cell cycle checkpoint defects in A-TLD and NBS (Carney et al. 1998; Stewart et al. 1999). Despite their severe clinical and cellular phenotypes	 those mutations do not confer overt recombinational DNA repair defects	 as was true in Rad50S/S mice. In contrast	 null Mre11 complex mutations	 which cause profound DNA recombination defects in S. cerevisiae	 are lethal in vertebrates. These outcomes support the possibility that essential and nonessential Mre11 complex functions are mechanistically distinct. The P. furiosis Mre11/Rad50 complex suggests a molecular basis for distinct mechanisms. This complex contains a bifunctional DNA binding domain in which the active site of the Mre11 nuclease is capable of binding ssDNA	 whereas an adjacent site accommodates double-stranded DNA. Occupancy of the sites is mutually exclusive	 suggesting that a given interaction with DNA facilitates enzymatic (in the ssDNA binding domain) or structural (in the dsDNA binding domain) functions (Hopfner et al. 2001). The data presented here argue that the essential functions of the complex cannot be clearly divided according to its enzymatic or structural roles.  Finally	 the data clearly indicate that the Mre11 complex exerts a profound influence on homeostasis in mammalian tissues even when its checkpoint and DNA recombination functions are not overtly impaired. The Rad50S/S mouse therefore establishes that subtle hypomorphism in a DNA damage response pathway is sufficient to induce severe pathology. This observation has important implications for understanding the mechanistic basis of disease related to chromosomal metabolism.  The RAD50 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is required for chromosome synapsis and recombination during meiosis and for repair of DNA damage during vegetative growth. The precise role of the RAD50 gene product in these processes is not known. Most rad50 mutant phenotypes can be explained by the proposal that the RAD50 gene product is involved in the search for homology between interacting DNA molecules or chromosomes	 but there is no direct evidence for this model. We present here the nucleotide sequence of the RAD50 locus and an analysis of the predicted 153-kD RAD50 protein. The amino terminal region of the predicted protein contains residues suggestive of a purine nucleotide binding domain	 most likely for adenine. The remaining 1 170 amino acids consist of two 250 amino acid segments of heptad repeat sequence separated by 320 amino acids	 plus a short hydrophobic carboxy-terminal tail. Heptad repeats occur in proteins such as myosin and intermediate filaments that form a-helical coiled coils. One of the two heptad regions in RAD50 shows similarity to the S-2 domain of rabbit myosin beyond that expected for two random coiled coil proteins. T HE RAD50 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae plays an important role in both production of viable spores in meiosis and in the repair of DNA damage during vegetative growth (HAYNES and KUNZ 1981; GAME et al. 1980). During meiosis	 RAD50 function is required for two interrelated events of meiotic prophase	 chromosome synapsis and recombination	 both of which are required for proper segregation of chromosomes at the first meiotic division (BAKER et al. 1976). In rad50 mutants	 the defect in chromosome synapsis is manifested cytologically by the absence of mature synaptonemal complexes (SC) (BYERS	 as cited in MALONE	 JORDAN and WARDMAN 1985). More specifically	 axial elements form between each pair of sister chromatids but never come together to form mature tripartite SCs (asynapsis) (FARNET et al. 1988; R. PADMORE and N. KLECKNER	 unpublished data). The rad50 defect in meiotic recombination is absolute and involves a block at a very early step in the recombination process as revealed by both phenotypic and epistasis analysis (MALONE and ESPOSITO 198 1 ; MALONE 1983; MONTELONE	 HOEKSTRA and MALONE 1988). RAD50 appears to act at a very early time in meiosis; it is required for the appearance of a specific meiotic signal which occurs just at the conclusion of premeiotic DNA replication	 and which manifests itself as a site specific double strand break or pair of double strand ends (L. CAO	 E. ALAN and N. KLECKNER	 unpublished data). The rad50 defects in meiotic recombination and synaptonemal complex formation are sufficient to account for the fact that fewer than (knrtics 122: 47-57 (May	 1080) one percent of the spores from a rad50 meiosis are viable (GAME et al. 1980). During vegetative growth	 RAD50 function is required for repair of some types of DNA damage	 including double strand breaks induced by ionizing radiation or the radiomimetic alkylating agent rnethylmethane sulfonate (MMS) (GAME and MORTIMER 1974; STRIKE	 cited in HAYNES and KUNZ 198 1; J. NITISS and M. RESNICK	 personal communication). rad50 mutants also exhibit a delay in the spindle elongation step of normal vegetative growth	 a phenotype which suggests that they are defective in repair of spontaneous DNA damage as well (FARNET et al. 1988; MONTELONE	 HOEKSTRA and MALONE 1988). RAD50-dependent DNA repair is thought to occur by a recombinational pathway (HAYNES and KUNZ 198 1). Both chromosome synapsis (SC formation) and meiotic recombination require that homologous chromosomes or DNA molecules find one another. Some models propose that synapsis is required for recombination; other models propose more complex relationships. An economical hypothesis would be that a single homology search is used for both processes. We have proposed that RAD50 is required for such a homology search and that the RAD50 dependent meiotic signal is a manifestation of this search (FARNET et al. 1988; L. CAO	 E. ALANI and N. KLECKNER	 unpublished data). The relationship between meiotic and mitotic phenotypes of rad50 mutants is also not established. However	 the involvement of RAD50 in DNA repair makes it seem more likely that it is directly involved in  48 E. Alani	 S. Subbiah and N. Kleckner meiotic chromosome metabolism rather than playing an indirect and/or regulatory role. The role proposed for RAD50 in meiosis could also account for its role in DNA repair	 since a recombinational repair pathway would also require recognition and interaction of homologous molecules. Arguments that RAD50 is required for recognition of homologous DNA segments have also been put forward by J. NITISS and M. RESNICK (personal communication). To further probe the nature of the RAD50 gene product	 we have carried out DNA sequence analysis of a previously cloned RAD50 gene. This analysis	 described below	 has identified a 1312 amino acid open reading frame which corresponds to the genetically defined RAD50 gene. The predicted 153-kD protein has three interesting features: (1) The amino terminal region of the predicted protein contains residues diagnostic of a purine nucleotide binding domain (ROSSMAN	 MORAS and OLSEN 1974)	 probably for adenine (FRY	 KUBY and MILDVAN 1986). (2) Two regions	 one at amino acids 177-421 and another at amino acids 743-995	 are segments of heptad repeat sequence characteristic of alpha helical coiled coil proteins such as myosin and intermediate filaments (MCLACHLAN and KARN 1982; STEINERT	 STEVENS and Roop 1985). (3) Heptad 743-995 also shows a significant similarity to the S2 domain of rabbit myosin (CAPONY and ELZINGA 198 1). MATERIALS AND METHODS Strains: Escherichia coli stain "294 (F-	 endA	 hsdR	 supE44	 thiA) was used for all plasmid manipulations (GUARENTE et al. 1980). JMlOl (Alac	 thi	 supE/F	 traD36	 proA	 proB	 laciq	 lacZA	 M15) was used as a host to prepare single stranded DNA for dideoxy sequencing (MESSING 1983). Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain NKY551 is a diploid that contains a complete coding region deletion of RAD50 (HindIII-Sal1 deletion	 Figure 1). NKY551 (a/a	 rad50A:: hisG/rad50A::hisG	 ura3lura3	 lys2/lys2	 ho::LYSB/ho::LysP) was constructed by transforming NKY278 (a/a	 ura3/ura3	 lys2/lys2	 ho::LYS2/ho::LYS2 to UraC with BglII and EcoRI digested pNKY83 (described below). The integration of this fragment resulted in a complete coding region deletion of RAD50 (blot not shown). One such transformant	 NKY492	 was plated onto 5-fluoro-orotic (5-FOA) acid plates and a Ura- strain	 NKY546	 was selected (ALANI	 CAO and KLECKNER 1987). Tetrad dissection of NKY546 yielded spores which segregated 2:2	 MMS'	 wild-type growth: MMS"	 slow growth (FARNET et al. 1988). Two rad50A haploid segregants from NKY546 were mated to form the homozygous rad50A strain NKY551. This strain sporulated at high frequency (50%) but yielded inviable spores. Media: E. coli was grown in LB broth (MILLER 1972). Ampicillin was supplemented at 25 pg/ml. Yeast was grown in either YPD or minimal medium (SHERMAN	 FINK and HICKS 1983). Minimal medium contained 0.7%; yeast nitrogen base	 2% agar	 2% glucose and 0.004% uracil. 5-FOA was purchased from SCM specialty chemical	 Gainesville	 Florida. 5-FOA plates were prepared as described previously (BOEKE	 LACROUTE and FINK 1984). Yeast transformations: All transformations were performed using standard methods (ITO et al. 1983). Nucleic acid techniques: All restriction enzymes	 T4 DNA ligase	 T4 DNA polymerase and BAL31 were purchased from New England Biolabs and used according to the manufacturer's specifications. Plasmid DNA was isolated by a cleared lysate protocol (MANIATIS	 FRITSCH and SAMBROOK 1982). DNA manipulations including isolation of single stranded DNA from "13 origin plasmids was described previously. Chromosomal yeast DNA isolation and Southern blotting were described previously (HOLM et al. 1986; SOUTHERN 1975; MELTON et al. 1984). Plasmid constructions: All plasmids were derived from the following vectors (relevant genotype and/or description): YEP24 (URA3	2p; ROSE	 GRISAFI and BOTSTEIN 1984; New England Biolabs Catalog 1986)	 YCP50 (URA3	 ARSI	 CEN4; STINCHCOMB	 MANN and DAVIS 1982) pSG205 (7-kb RAD50 HindIII fragment inserted into YCP50	 from S. GOTTLIEB and R. ESPOSITO)	 pOL13 (pSG205 derivative with RAD50 in opposite orientation)	 and "13 sequencing vectors pGC-1	 pGC-2	 POL10 (pGC-I with the HindIII site destroyed) and pNKY47 (POL10 with a HindIII linker at BamHI site) (MYERS and MANIATIS 1985). pNKYlOO is a vector that was used to clone chromosomal sequences upstream of the 5' HindIII site in RAD50. A 4.0- kb HindIII-Sal1 subclone from pSG205 was inserted into the HindIII-Sal1 backbone of pBR322 to make pNKY 19. A HindIII URA3 subclone isolated from YEP24 was inserted into the HindIII site of pNKY19 to form pNKY100. In pNKYlOO URA3 transcription is in the same direction as RAD50 and EcoRI cuts only once in the plasmid	 between amp' and URA3. pNKYlOl is a vector bearing the RAD50 gene and its upstream sequences. pNKYlO0 was linearized within the RAD50 gene by an NsiI restriction digest and then integrated into the RAD50 locus of NKY501 (a	 his#-7 13	 lys2- 20	 sufl0	 ura3	 Ura- derivative of RE82 1	 kindly supplied by R. ESPOSITO) by lithium acetate transformation (blot not shown). Chromosomal DNA from the integrant was isolated	 digested with EcoRI	 ligated and transformed into "294. An amp' plasmid bearing the HindIII-Sal1 RAD50 fragment plus 2.8 kb of additional upstream RAD50 sequence was isolated and designated pNKY 10 1. pNKY74 is a pGC derived vector (MYERS and MANIATIS 1985) that contains an 8.8-kb RAD50 clone. RAD50 DNA upstream of the coding region was isolated on a 2 kb BglIIHindIII fragment from pNKYlOl and inserted into the BglIl and HindIII backbone of pNKY47 to form pNKY73. The RAD50 locus	 containing the coding region plus both 5' and 3' flanking sequence	 was reconstructed by inserting the 7-kb HindIII RAD50 fragment from pSG205 into pNKY73 to form the integrating vector pNKY74. pNKY1070 is an ARSI	 CEN4 vector that contains 6.6 kb of RAD50 sequence. pNKY74 was digested with EcoRI and a 6.6-kb RAD50 fragment was inserted into the EcoRI site of YCP50. pNKY83 was used to delete the Hind-Sal1 RAD50 sequences from the chromosome in order to create complete chromosomal coding region deletions of RAD50. The 6.6- kb RAD50 EcoRI fragment from pNKY74 was inserted into the EcoRI site of a pBR322 derived vector (PvuII-EcoRI deletion) to form pNKY79. pNKY79 was digested with HindIII and Sal1 (complete RAD50 coding region deletion	 filled in with T4 DNA polymerase and religated in the presence of BamHI 8-bp linkers. Finally	 a 3.8-kb BglIIBamHI hi&-URA3-hisG fragment (ALANI	 CAO and KLECKNER 1987) was inserted into the BamHI linker site to form pNKY83. pNKY5 and pNKY6 are RAD50 vectors that were used  Analysis of Yeast RAD50 Gene 49 to sequence both strands of RAD50 (strands A and B	 respectively). POL13 was digested with XhoI and EcoRI. A 9.7-kb RAD50 fragment was inserted into the XhoI and EcoRI sites of POL10 to form pNKY5. The 7-kb HindIII fragment from pSG205 was blunt ended with T4 DNA polymerase and inserted into the blunt ended Sal1 site of pGC-2 to form pNKY6 (HindIII site is regenerated). Dideoxy sequencing: A 4.0-kb HindIII-Sal1 RAD50 subclone that was shown to complement the rad50-1 mutation was sequenced by the dideoxy approach (MESSING 1983). Two M13 origin vectors	 pNKY5 and 6	 which bear the HindIIISalI fragment in opposite orientations	 were used as substrates for BAL31 deletion. The end points of 24 deletions in pNKY5 and 25 deletions in pNKY6 were sequenced (Figure 3). DNA sequences that were not uncovered by BAL31 deletion were sequenced by cloning restriction fragments into appropriate MI 3 vectors. Using this approach the entire HindIII-Sal1 fragment was sequenced on both strands. Sequences downstream of Sal1 were sequenced on only one strand (pNKY5). Transcription studies indicated that the RAD50 gene is transcribed from HindIII to SalI (FARNET et al. 1988; W. RAYMOND and N. KLECKNER	 unpublished data). Because aberrant RAD50 transcripts are observed on ARS CEN vectors that contain the HindIII-Sal1 clone	 sequences upstream of the HindIII site were cloned (pNKYlO1). Upstream from the HindIII site 600 bp of DNA were sequenced on both strands by cloning restriction fragments into pGC-1 and pGC-2. Computer analysis: All computer analysis was performed on a Digital VAX 8700 computer. RAD50 amino acid sequence was compared to the NBRF protein data bank	 release #I 5 (493 1 sequences	1	264	388 residues) using the FASTP algorithm described by LIPMAN and PEARSON (1985). Fourier analysis was performed by a method described by MCLACHLAN and KARN (1983). Heptad shuffle analysis using NEEDLEMAN-WUNSCH matrix analysis was described by s. SUBBIAH (unpublished data). The SIM matrix (similarity cutoff = 5 SD	 gap penalties = 18 or 24 (McLACHLAN 1971)) and UP matrix (similarity cutoff = 3 SD	 gap penalties = 3 or 5 (DAYHOFF 1978)) were used in this analysis and the following 2 values (LIPMAN and PEARSON 1985) were calculated using these matrices: 2 regular = (similarity score - mean similarity score of scrambled sequences)/(standard deviation of scrambled similarity scores) (NEEDLEMAN and WUNSCH 1970). 2 heptad = (similarity score - mean similarity score of heptad shuffled sequences)/ (standard deviation of heptad shuffled similarity scores) (S. SUBBIAH	 unpublished data). 2 control = 2 heptad analysis of aligned protein sequences scrambled once in register (S. SUBBIAH	 unpublished data). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION A 9.5-kb region which includes the RAD50 gene is diagrammed in Figure 1. RAD50 function is contained within a four kilobase region defined by HindIII and SalI restriction sites; this segment complements the mitotic and meiotic defects of both point and deletion mutants in RAD50 when present on an autonomously replicating yeast plasmid (ARSZ	 CEN4) (KUPIEC and SIMCHEN 1984; S. GOTTLIEB and R. E. ESPOSITO	 personal communication; see MATERIALS AND METHODS).

Additional information outside of this minimal segment is required for normal expression of the RAD50 gene. When expressed as a HindIII to SalI fragment on an ARS CEN vector	 both the size and quantity of the RAD50 transcripts differ from that observed for a chromosomal RAD50 gene (W. RAYMOND and N. KLECKNER	 unpublished data). However	 a normal chromosomal transcription pattern is obtained with a larger 6.6-kb BgZII to EcoRI RAD50 subclone (W. RAYMOND and N. KLECKNER	 unpublished data). To define the RAD50 coding region in more detail	 the DNA sequence was determined for a 4775-bp region that includes the HindIII-Sal1 fragment (Figure 2). This analysis	 described in Figure 3 and MATERIALS AND METHODS	 reveals a continuous 1312 amino acid open reading frame (ORF) that is fully contained in the minimal RAD50 HindIII-Sal1 segment (Figure 2). The corresponding protein begins with a methionine encoded by bp 558-560 and terminates with a stop codon at bp 4492-4494 and has a predicted M	. of 153 kD. Immunoblot analysis of yeast proteins has subsequently identified a single polypeptide of the expected M	. which has been correlated genetically with RAD50 function (W. RAYMOND and N. KLECKNER unpublished data). The RAD50 protein predicted from the DNA sequence is composed of 17.5% acidic	 15.9% basic	 30.9% hydrophobic and 36.0% polar residues; nine glycosylation consensus sequences (NXS	 X # P) are present. KYTE-DOOLITTLE (1 983) analysis suggests that the protein is predominantly hydrophilic; the longest hydrophobic region is a 35 amino acid segment near the carboxy terminus of the protein (amino acids 1205-1232	 corresponding to bp 4170-4256 in Figure 2) which contains 20 hydrophobic residues. Nucleotide binding domain: Initial inspection of the RAD50 amino acid sequence reveals a short glycine-rich sequence that has previously been found in the sequences of many adenine and guanine nucleotide binding proteins (Figure 4; FRY	 KUBY and MILD-  50 E.

In adenylate kinase	 this sequence specifies a flexible loop whose terminal lysine residue appears to interact with the a-phosphoryl group of Mg-ATP (FRY	 KUBY and MILDVAN 1986; DREUSICKE and SCHULZ 1986). In a number of ATP and GTP binding proteins	 this loop is suggested to mediate conformational changes in the protein brought about in some cases by interactions with additional proteins (FRY	 KUBY and MILDVAN 1986; REINSTEIN	 BRUNE and WITTINCHOFER 1988).

Sequence of both strands of the RAD50 HindIII-Sal1 segment was obtained as described in this figure and in the MATERIALS AND METHODS. In addition	 RAD50 protein is predicted by ARIADNE	 a computer matching program that utilizes a descriptor pattern for the ATP binding motif (LATHROP	 WEBSTER and SMITH 1987; RALPH	 WEBSTER and SMITH 1987)	 and CHOU-FASMAN (1978) analysis to have specific secondary structure features common to the ATP binding pockets of many other nucleotide binding proteins. These include a hydrophobic Pstrand and an a-helix which flank the flexible loop (ROSSMAN	 MORAS and OLSEN 1974; BRADLEY et al. 1987; Figure 4). Preliminary analysis reveals several reasonable candidates for a magnesium coordination site (BRADLEY et al. 1987; T. WEBSTER and M. BRADLEY	 personal communication). RAD50 protein probably binds an adenine nucleotide. It lacks two consensus sequence features that are specific to the known set of closely related guanine nucleotide binding proteins (DEVER	 GLYNIAS and MERRICK 1987). ATP binding is a common feature of DNA repair and recombination proteins from E. coli (RecA	 RecBCD	 RecN	 UvrABC	 UvrD)	 S. typhimurium (MutS) and S. cerevisiae (RAD3) (SMITH 1988 for review	 BACKENDORF et al. 1986; HABER et al. 1988; NAUMOVSKI and FRIEDBERG 1986).

Heptad repeat sequences and similarity to myosin S2 domain: Two regions within the RAD50 amino acid sequence, designated heptad I (177-421) and heptad I1 (743-995) display a heptad repeat pattern found in proteins such as myosin, keratin and tropomyosin (MCLACHLAN and KARN 1982, 1983; COHEN and PARRY 1986). The heptad repeat is a seven amino acid sequence with primarily hydrophobic amino acids at the first and fourth positions and a high percentage of charged amino acids at the other positions. When present in a repeated motif, this unit forms an alpha helical structure (Figure 5). Two heptad-containing a-helices can coil around one another in a regular helical structure that is stabilized by repeated interactions between hydrophobic residues and specific, oppositely charged residues on the two chains (Figure 5) (MCLACHLAN and KARN 1982). The RAD50 heptad repeat regions were identified and analyzed by three separate methods, discussed below. These approaches also reveal a significant similarity between heptad I1 and the S-2 fragment of rabbit myosin heavy chain. The RAD50 protein sequence was compared to other protein sequences in the NBRF database using the FASTP computer algorithm of LIPMAN and PEARSON (1985). This analysis provides a similarity score for each such comparison. A significant match is indicated if the difference between the similarity score of a match of interest and the average similarity score is more than 10 SD (Z 2 10). When comparisons are made under conditions were significant gaps in matching sequences were allowed, eight protein sequences show significant homology to RAD50 protein. These include rabbit skeletal muscle myosin (heavy chain S- 2 fragment), rabbit cardiac muscle myosin (a and P heavy chains), and several muscle tropomyosins from chicken, rabbit and rat. When stricter penalties are assigned for gaps, only the rabbit S-2 myosin fragment continues to show strong similarity to RAD50 (Z = 12.5). RAD50 protein and the rabbit S-2 myosin fragment are 22% identical over the entire 259 amino acid rabbit myosin fragment (CAPONY and ELZINGA 198 1, Figure 6). The five proteins initially identified by FASTP analysis are all known to contain extensive regions that form a-helical coiled coils. Therefore, a systematic search for heptad repeats in the RAD50 protein was carried out using Fourier analysis. A computer program based on the analysis of MCLACHLAN and KARN (1 983) was written to search for repeats of seven residue sequences containing hydrophobic amino acids at the first and fourth positions (MCLACHLAN and KARN 1983). The RAD50 protein sequence was divided into eleven blocks of 120 amino acids each; each block was analyzed individually. This approach eliminates the possibility that small heptad containing regions might be obscured by large non-heptad regions; it is sensitive enough to detect heptad-containing sequences only twenty to thirty amino acids long (three or four heptads). The Fourier analysis reveals that two large regions of the protein contain significant amounts of heptad repeat sequence: three consecutive blocks of 120 amino acids in the amino-terminal third of the protein and three consecutive 120 amino acid blocks in the carboxy-terminal third of the protein. Visual inspection of these two regions identified by Fourier analysis reveals that each contain a single, virtually uninterrupted series of heptad repeats; both the end points of each region and rare one or two amino acid deletions in the heptad pattern (skip residues) could be unambiguously identified. The amino-terminal region heptad I spans amino acids 177-421; it consists of thirty-five heptad repeats, one of which contains a skip residue. Heptad I1 spans amino acids 743-995; it consists of thirty-seven heptads, three of which contain one skip residue and one contains twp residues. Given the rise of an alpha helix at 1.485 A per amino acid (FRASER and MACRAE 1973), the length of alpha helical coiled coil structures involving heptad I and heptad 11, if present as fully extended rods, would be 364 A and 385 A, respectively. However, other coiled coil interactions exist which do not result in extended rod structures (BANNER, KOKKINIDIS and TSERNOCLOU 1987). Interestingly, heptad I1 and the entire S-2 fragment of rabbit myosin are exactly co-extensive, with 37 heptads each. The amino acid compositions of the two RAD50 heptad regions and the S-2 domain of rabbit myosin are very similar to those of previously analyzed CYhelical coiled coil regions. These three regions and the relevant portions of nematode myosin, keratin and tropomyosin are compared in Table 1 (MCLACHLAN and KARN 1983; PARRY et al. 1977; STONE and SMILLIE 1978; KARN, BRENNER and BARNETT  54 E.

References for the protein sequences were as follows: rabbit myosin S2 domain (CAPONY and ELZINGA 1981), nematode myosin (KARN, BRENNER and BARNETT 1983), a-keratin (PARRY et al. 1977), and tropomyosin (STONE and SMILLIE 1978). 1983). All five regions show the distribution of hydrophobic and charged amino acids characteristic of coiled coil proteins: high percentages of hydrophobic residues at the first and fourth positions of the heptad (56-88%), and at the other positions, low percentages of hydrophobic residues (8-1 9%) and a high percentage of charged amino acid residues (34-63%) (Figure 5, Table 1). Significance of similarity with rabbit myosin S-2 domain: The similarity between RAD50 heptad I1 and the rabbit S-2 myosin fragment (Figure 6) is suggestive. Further analysis indicates the existence of a deeper relationship between the two proteins than expected simply on the basis of their heptad nature. The RAD50 and the rabbit S-2 fragment protein sequences were examined by a computer comparison program designed to eliminate the contributions of the repeating heptad pattern itself. This program, a modified NEEDLEMAN-WUNSCH analysis that incorporates a â€œheptad shuffle,â€ is described below (Table 2; S. SUBBIAH, unpublished data). Standard NEEDLEMAN-WUNSCH (1 970) analysis allows the optimal alignment of two sequences to yield a similarity score. To determine the significance of that optimal alignment, both sequences are scrambled at the same time and a NEEDLEMAN-WUNSCH similarity score is determined after each scrambling. From this process an average random score and its standard deviation is determined. Then the difference between the similarity score of the optimal alignment and the average random score of the distribution is assessed in terms of standard deviation units. This calculation yields a value called 2 regular. In this type of analysis, two heptad-containing proteins should always show greater similarity to one another than to a scrambled sequence in which the constraints of the heptad sequence are removed. This was verified by creating and then comparing two nonidentical amino acid sequences each consisting of 30 â€œperfectâ€ heptads; 2 regular for these two sequences is close to (UP matrix, DAYHOFF 1978) or above (SIM matrix, MCLACHLAN 1971) the cutoff for significant  Analysis of Yeast RAD50 Gene 55 TABLE 2 Detailed comparison of RAD50 heptad I (HEPI), RAD50 heptad I1 (HEPII), nematode myosin S-2 domain (NEM), and rabbit myosin S-2 domain (RAB) protein sequences UP matrix analysis SIM matrix analysis CornDdrison 2-hemad 2-regular Z-heotad Z-regular 1.

References are as follows: Rabbit myosin S2 domain (CAPONY and ELZINCA 1981) and nematode myosin (KARN, BRENNER and BARNETT 1983). homologies (Table 2). This defect was eliminated by performing the usual significance analysis on a set of control sequences scrambled in such a way that the heptad nature was always retained. Specifically, amino acids at the hydrophobic core positions of the reference sequence were scrambled separately from amino acids at other positions (MATERIALS AND METHODS, the heptad shuffle). The comparison of a sequence of interest with this control set gives a value called 2 heptad. Additional calculations show that the heptad shuffle does not dramatically change the similarity scores obtained either for two non-heptad proteins of similar amino acid composition or for two heptadcontaining proteins with a significant percentage of amino acid identities (S. SUBBIAH, unpublished data). For each pairwise combination of RAD50 heptads I and I1 and the S-2 domains of rabbit and nematode myosins, alignments were made by the standard NEEDLEMAN-WUNSCH procedure. For each pair, alignments were made using two different matrices to define amino acid relatedness (UP and SIM, MATERIALS AND METHODS). The significance of each alignment was evaluated both with and without the heptad shuffle (Table 2). Heptad I exhibits no significant similarity to any of the other sequences regardless of the relatedness matrix and significance analysis used. In contrast, heptad I1 and the rabbit S-2 domain shows significant relatedness under all conditions, although in one case the level of relatedness was slightly less than the number of standard deviations usually taken as a cutoff point (MCLACHLAN 1971; DAYHOFF 1978). Biological importance of coiled coil regions: Proteins that contain coiled coil regions participate in a variety of biological processes including muscle movement, anti-sense RNA pairing, nuclear envelope formation and viral pathogenesis (STEINERT, STEVENS and Roop 1985; MCLACHLAN and KARN 1982; BANNER, KOKKINIDIS and TSERN~CLOU 1987; AEBI et al. 1986; MCKEON, KIRSCHNER and CAPUT 1986). Some of these proteins show an additional feature that is also observed in the RAD50 protein sequence; the nuclear and cytoplasmic intermediate filament protein sequences contain long heptad repeat regions that are interspersed with non-heptad spacers (STEINERT, STEVENS and Roop 1985). The RAD50 protein also shows a 320 amino acid non-heptad spacer region between heptad I and heptad 11. However, the length of the RAD50 spacer is much larger than those present in intermediate filament proteins (STEINERT, STEVENS and Roop 1985). In the absence of any specific information about the role of RAD50 function, we can only speculate as to the role of its coiled coil regions. Three intriguing and somewhat unusual possibilities have arisen thus far. One possibility would be that the RAD50 protein stretches across the synaptonemal complex. The length of each coiled coil region is approximately the distance between an axial element and the central element, so the protein might extend from one axial element to the other, with the two heptad containing regions spanning the two regions that separate the axial and central elements. A second possibility, suggested by the similarity of heptad I1 to the S2 domain of myosin would be that RAD50 is part of a contractile system which actively brings homologous chromosomes together once homology is sensed. A third possibility, raised by the apparent similarity in overall structure between RAD50 protein and kinesin (J. GELLES, personal communication), would be that RAD50 is involved in translocation of DNA molecules along microtubules, or vice versa. Kinesin is an ATP dependent translocator that travels along microtubules. Electron microscopy suggests that each kinesin molecule consists of a globular domain at one end plus two rod-like elements connected by a flexible joint (AMOS 1987). The globular domain is in contact with microtubules and presumably encodes the ATP binding activity; the arrangement of the rod-like elements is suggestive of two a-helical coiled coils interrupted by a spacer (AMOS 1987). This organization is similar to that of RAD50, with its amino terminal purine nucleotide binding domain and two separated heptad repeat regions. However, computer comparisons between RAD50 and a partial sequence of Drosophila kinesin do not reveal any significant similarity beyond that expected from their common coiled coil and purine nucleotide binding features (L. GOLDSTEIN, personal communication). Biochemical purification of the RAD50 protein and genetic analysis of rad50 mutants should be useful in understanding the  56 E. Alani, S. Subbiah and N. Kleckner role of RAD50 protein in mitotic DNA repair and in meiotic recombination.  Approximately 5â€“10% of all breast and ovarian cancers are due to genetic predisposition.1 Germline mutations in two major susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, explain most of the hereditary ovarian cancer cases, but worldwide have been observed only in a fraction of the breast cancer families; in Finland, about 20%.2â€“4 A small portion of the remaining cases, perhaps 1â€“2%, appears to be caused by germline mutations in other cancer susceptibility genes such as TP53, PTEN, AR, and ATM. 5 Recently, moderate or low penetrance germline mutations such as 1100delC of CHK2 have also been implicated,6 suggesting that in many cases the phenotypic expression of the disease is accounted for by the combined effect of multiple but more subtle mutations in different target genes.5 7 Despite all these discoveries, many breast cancer families, especially those with fewer than four cases and/or with later disease onset, have cancers due to mutations in still unknown genes. As the protein products of the genes so far indicated are central players in the pathways involved in cell cycle checkpoint functions and in the sensing, transduction, and repair of DNA lesions,5 other similarly acting genes may represent new potential candidates for breast and/or ovarian cancer susceptibility. The Mre11 complex, composed of the proteins MRE11, NBS1, and RAD50, is a vital component in the DNA damage response and is at least partially responsible for connecting DNA damage detection to DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint functions. The early association of the complex with damaged DNA suggests its involvement in sensing DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). In eukaryotes, DSB repair is handled by two different pathways, homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), and the initial step in both is the recognition and signalling of the damage by the Mre11 complex.8â€“10 In addition to DNA damage detection and repair, the complex has an important role in co-ordinating checkpoint responses and DNA replication,11â€“14 and is also required for the maintenance of telomeres.15 The sites important for the composition and various functional activities of the Mre11 complex have been characterised (summarised in fig 1). Because of its independent interaction with both NBS1 and RAD50, MRE11 has been viewed as the core of the complex, whereas the interaction between NBS1 and RAD50 is indirect and mediated through MRE11.9 16 17 The sites in MRE11 responsible for binding to NBS1 and RAD50 have both been assigned to the aminoterminal half of the protein.16 18 In NBS1, the MRE11 binding domain has been located to the extreme carboxyterminus of the protein,16 and the corresponding site in RAD50 has been located to a 40 residue coiled coil region adjacent to the ABC domain.19 20 Additionally, several other important domains for the complex function have been identified. The DNA nuclease activity is restricted to MRE11 and specified by phosphodiesterase motifs in the aminoterminal half of the molecule.18 The aminoterminus of NBS1 exhibits a forkhead associated (FHA) domain, followed by a BRCA1 carboxyterminal (BRCT) domain.21 Both of these highly conserved domains are involved in proteinâ€“protein interactions and are therefore crucial for the functions of the Mre11 complex, including its ............................................................... .

The complex components interact with several proteins (for example BRCA1, ATM and CHK2) already connected to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility, which makes MRE11, NBS1, and RAD50 suitable candidate genes for predisposition to these cancers. N We screened the affected index cases of 151 families with signs of hereditary susceptibility to breast and/or ovarian cancer for germline mutations in the Mre11 complex genes. Seven novel heterozygous alterations were observed, three of which were considered potentially disease-related: MRE11 913CRT (Arg305Trp), NBS1 448CRT (Leu150Phe) and RAD50 687delT (stop codon at 234). N RAD50 687delT is expected to cause major truncation in both known protein isoforms and occurs in multiple individuals of two families. Curiously, RAD50 687delT was also present in some of the controls, but at a lower frequency, probably referring to incomplete penetrance. The MRE11 and NBS1 alterations affected highly conserved amino acids and were seen in single cancer cases, but they were both absent in 1000 healthy controls. N Our results suggest that these three mutations in the Mre11 complex genes associate with hereditary susceptibility to breast and/or ovarian cancer, and may be important in other types of cancer too. This is the first time to our knowledge that germline mutations in RAD50 have been linked to genetic disease in humans. 1 www.jmedgenet.com subcellular localisation after DNA damage.17 22 RAD50 in turn consists of bipartite N- and C-terminal ATPase segments, which assemble into a single ABC-type cassette at the end of the predicted antiparallel coiled coil.19 A functionally important zinc hook has been identified in the central portion of the coiled coil domain.23 This zinc hook is thought to mediate RAD50 dimerisation, which allows the required molecular flexibility of the Mre11 complex and keeps it functionally assembled during the DNA recombination and repair process.14 The Mre11 complex proteins interact with several important protein partners, many of which have been related to cancer predisposition. For instance, following ionising radiation, NBS1 is phosphorylated in an ATM dependent manner to ensure proper response to DNA damage.11 In turn, MRE11 phosphorylation relies on NBS1.24 Co-operation between a functional Mre11 complex and ATM is also required for activation of the CHK2 kinase in response to DNA damage.12 In addition, MRE11, NBS1 and RAD50 are linked through proteinâ€“protein interactions with BRCA1. After exposure to ionising radiation, BRCA1 forms nuclear foci that co-localise with the Mre11 complex.25 Along with BRCA1, ATM, and other proteins, MRE11, NBS1, and RAD50 are also part of a multi-subunit protein complex referred to as the BRCA1 associated genome surveillance complex (BASC).26 Failure in the DNA damage response and repair processes causes chromosomal instability that may result in cancer predisposition. For two of the Mre11 complex genes, namely MRE11 and NBS1, the connection to cancer has already been established: germline mutations in MRE11 are associated with the ataxia telangiectasia-like disorder (ATLD),27 whereas defects in NBS1 cause Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS).9 21 Cells derived from ATLD and NBS patients display similar characteristics as those from ataxia telangiectasia (AT) patients, and AT due to germline mutations in the ATM gene has been associated with an increased risk of developing various malignancies; breast cancer, lymphoma, and leukaemia in particular.28 As yet, germline mutations in RAD50 have not been connected to genetic diseases in humans. However, in mice certain germline RAD50 mutations result in growth defects and cancer predisposition.29 Because mutations in ATM, CHK2, and BRCA1 have all been previously linked to hereditary predisposition to breast and/or ovarian cancer5 it is possible that germline mutations in the individual Mre11 complex genes may also be directly involved in predisposition to these cancers. The suggested connection has been supported by a recent study, where the NBS1 657del5 founder mutation was found to be responsible for the occurrence of a small but significant portion of familial breast cancer cases.30 On these grounds, we tested 151 index patients from Finnish families with signs of hereditary susceptibility to breast and/or ovarian cancer for possible germline mutations in the MRE11, NBS1, and RAD50 genes. The results of our study indicate novel disease associated alterations. MATERIALS AND METHODS Subjects and unaffected controls Index cases diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer of 151 families originating from northern Finland were selected for the screening of germline MRE11, NBS1, and RAD50 mutations. Of the studied families, 95 were associated with breast, 29 with breastâ€“ovarian, and 4 with ovarian cancer. These families met the criteria for either high (76 families) or moderate (52 families) genetic susceptibility to breast and/or ovarian cancer. Inclusion criteria for the families were one or more of the following: (a) two to three or more cases of breast and/or ovarian cancer in first or second degree relatives; (b) early disease onset ((35 years); (c) bilateral breast cancer; or (d) multiple primary tumours including breast or ovarian cancer in the same individual. The high risk families mainly included three or more cancer cases. All of the high risk families had been screened for germline mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, CHK2, and TP53, and eleven of them were found to be BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation positive.4 31 32 Besides high or moderate risk families, 23 families showing single cases of breast or ovarian cancer along with multiple cases (two or more) of other kinds of cancer in first or second degree relatives were included in the study. Additionally, 1000 anonymous cancer free individuals were used as controls, and the occurrence of novel, potentially pathogenic alterations was also investigated in 192 breast cancer patients without family history of the disease. Both groups derived from the same geographical area as the studied families. All patients had given their informed consent for obtaining pedigree data and blood specimens for a study on cancer susceptibility gene mutations. Approval to perform the study was obtained from the ethics board of the Northern Ostrobotnia Health Care District and the Finnish Ministry of Social Affairs and Health. Screening for germline mutations DNA from blood lymphocytes was extracted using the standard phenolâ€“chloroform method or the Puregene D- 50K purification kit (Gentra, Minneapolis, MN, USA). The coding regions and exonâ€“intron boundaries of the MRE11, NBS1, and RAD50 genes were screened for germline mutations by conformation sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE), which has been shown to be a cost efficient way to scan genes with high sensitivity and specifity.4 33 Samples with band shift were reamplified and the sequencing analysis was performed with the Li-cor IR2 4200-S DNA Analysis system (Li-cor Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA) using the SequiTherm EXELTM II DNA Sequencing kit LC (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI, USA). Oligonucleotides for CSGE and sequencing were designed by using Primer3 software based on sequence information obtained from publicly available databases. Oligonucleotide sequences and PCR conditions are available upon request. LOH analysis Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis was performed to assess whether the tumours of the patients displaying the novel MRE11 and RAD50 germline mutations had lost the wildtype allele. The flanking microsatellite DNA markers used for MRE11 were D11S4176 and D11S1757; and for RAD50 D5S2110, D5S2057, D5S1984, D5S2002, and D5S2117. The PCR products were analysed with the Li-cor DNA Analysis system using the IRD800 labelled forward primer. Figure 1 Components of the Mre11 complex.

Using the FastTrackH 2.0 Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), mRNA from lymphoblast cell lines was isolated, following which cDNA synthesis was carried out with the GeneRacerTM kit (Invitrogen). The use of the GeneRacerTM Kit ensured that only transcripts containing full length cDNA ends were used in PCR analysis. Primers used for the cDNA specific amplification of RAD50 exon 5 were: forward 59-TTTGAAGCAAAAGTTTGATGAGA-39 (located in exon 4) and reverse 59- TCATTGTCAAGTTTCATTATTTTAGAG-39 (located in exon 6). RESULTS Novel germline alterations The mutation analysis of the MRE11, NBS1, and RAD50 genes revealed several germline alterations. Eleven heterozygous changes in protein encoding regions were observed (summarised in tables 1 and 2). Seven of the alterations were novel and three of these were considered potentially disease related. In addition, a large number of different apparently harmless alterations occurring in intron regions was seen (data not shown). MRE11 and NBS1 In the MRE11 gene, a single mutation in exon 10 was found in one index case with ovarian cancer (case 322, fig 2A). This novel single base change, a transition CRT at position 913, resulted in substitution of arginine to tryptophan at codon 305. The position of the involved arginine is extremely conserved between several species, even those distantly related (fig 4) (yeast and flowering plant: data not shown). Additionally, the flanking regions on both sides of this residue are well conserved, suggesting functional importance. In contrast to MRE11, multiple alterations within the protein encoding region of NBS1 were detected, but only one was considered potentially pathogenic. This novel change, a CRT transition at nucleotide 448, results in substitution of leucine to phenylalanine at codon 150 and was displayed by one index case diagnosed with breast cancer (case 277, fig 2B). Interestingly, this alteration occurs in the middle of the highly conserved BRCT domain, where the leucine residue at position 150 is conserved also in the mouse, rat, and chicken orthologues (fig 4). Both the MRE11 and NBS1 mutations were observed in single multi-cancer families including one ovarian or one breast cancer case, respectively, but co-segregation with the cancer phenotype could not be confirmed owing to lack of DNA specimens from additional family members. However, both of the mutations were absent from a large cohort of population controls (n = 1000), indicating that these mutations may indeed relate to cancer predisposition (table 1). RAD50 In RAD50, four novel germline changes affecting exon regions were discovered (tables 1 and 2). Of these changes, His68His appears to be a harmless polymorphism, but the roles of Ile94Leu and Arg224His alterations remain more difficult to determine. Both of these substitutions affect conserved residues, the former in the remarkably well conserved aminoterminal ATPase domain and the latter in the coiled coil domain,19 20 but they also occurred in the healthy controls, although at lower frequency. Interestingly, one of the breast cancer families displaying the RAD50 Ile94Leu variant also showed partial co-segregation with the previously identified CHK2 Ile157Thr unknown variant.31 Until further clarifying studies have been carried out, the cancer predisposing role of these two RAD50 variants remains unknown. However, at least one of the identified RAD50 alterations, 687delT, is likely to be disease related. The RAD50 687delT truncation mutation The RAD50 687delT mutation in exon 5 leads to a premature stop at codon 234 and affects both isoforms of the protein.

Electronic letter 3 www.jmedgenet.com The deletion was found in two separate families (fig 3). In family 5, the index case and her sister (cases 828 and 474), both diagnosed with breast cancer, were carriers of the mutation. In family 6, the index (case 505) with ovarian cancer carried RAD50 687delT, but had also tested positive for the BRCA1 3745delT mutation in one of our previous studies.4 In addition, the deceased mother with ovarian cancer was an obligatory carrier of at least the RAD50 687delT mutation. In all the other cases tested, both the RAD50 and the BRCA1 truncation mutation segregated incompletely with the disease. The observation of unaffected RAD50 truncation mutation carriers in family 6, and also the surprisingly high prevalence at the population level (0.6%) suggested not only that RAD50 687delT, if truly pathogenic, exhibits low penetrance, but also that it might predispose carriers to cancer without clustering of the disease
