# Gene-Mutation-Classification

Gene mutation classification is an important aspect of cancer tumor detection, as it helps identify specific genetic mutations that contribute to the development and progression of cancer.

Text evidence plays a crucial role in this process, as it provides valuable information on the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying cancer.

Machine learning algorithms can be trained on such text evidence to identify patterns and associations between specific gene mutations and cancer types, as well as to predict the functional effects of these mutations on gene expression and cellular pathways.

Manual gene classification is a time-consuming process where pathologists interpret every genetic mutation from the clinical evidence manually. 

The criterion of manual classification is still unknown.

The main aim of this project is to propose a multiclass classifier to classify the genetic mutations based on clinical evidence (i.e., the text description of these genetic mutations) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

Three different text vectorizers were used in this project namely - 
  1. CountVectorizer
  2. TF IDF Vectorizer
  3. Word2Vec

Various classifiers used are - 
  1. Linear Regression
  2. Random Forest
  3. XGBoost
  4. K Nearest Neighbor
  5. Naive Bayes
